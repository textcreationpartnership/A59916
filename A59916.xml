            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> concerning the <hi>living</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking Judges of his Church,</hi> Judges
<pb facs="tcp:40740:6"/> for the time being in every Age. Quite <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting</hi> what he had ſaid not long before, (<hi>p.</hi> 95.) That <hi>Reaſon, Inſpiration,</hi> and <hi>Examples of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fathers,</hi> muſt <hi>joyntly</hi> make up the <hi>only Guide,</hi> which <hi>He affirms to be Infallible. For, unleſs they all concurr</hi> (as he had ſaid before that, <hi>p.</hi> 93.) <hi>together with the preſent viſible Governours</hi> (to whom he there gives <hi>a judging determining power) That which we take to be Reaſon, and Inſpiration, and the ſenſe of the Primitive Church, may deceive and miſguide us.</hi> Now beſides that <hi>this</hi> ſaying deſtroyes the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> where no leſs was aſcrib'd to the <hi>preſent viſible Superiours living and ſpeaking,</hi> than here is attributed to <hi>all four Requiſites in conjunction;</hi> we know that <hi>Reaſon</hi> may be <hi>deceiv'd, Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> be <hi>counterfeit</hi> by ſome <hi>unclean ſpirit,</hi> (which fallible Reaſon muſt be the Judge of) primitive <hi>Fathers</hi> ſubject to <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>preſent</hi> Superiours much more than <hi>Primitive:</hi> And, <hi>many fallible</hi> Guides can never make up one <hi>Infallible,</hi> any more than <hi>many Planets</hi> can make <hi>one Sun,</hi> or <hi>many Acts</hi> of finite <hi>knowledge</hi> one true <hi>omniſcience.</hi> For as Mr. <hi>Creſsy</hi> does confeſs, that <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience, are incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Attributes of God Himſelf, (p.</hi> 98.) ſo he imply's a <hi>contradiction,</hi> when he ſaith they are <hi>communicable</hi> to any <hi>creature,</hi> ſuch as is his <hi>preſent viſible Church.</hi> And <hi>another</hi> Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as bad, or worſe, when he ſaith that
<pb facs="tcp:40740:7"/> 
               <hi>a man, although of much Ignorance, may in a ſort be Omniſcient within his ſphere,</hi> (p. 99.) which is as if he ſhould have ſaid, That a man may be <hi>able</hi> to have a <hi>knowledge of all things,</hi> becauſe he may <hi>ſo know</hi> them <hi>All,</hi> as to be <hi>Ignorant</hi> of <hi>ſome.</hi> But then, with the help of that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:40740:10"/> does he give his <hi>Approbation</hi> until the <hi>Council</hi> is at an <hi>end.</hi> His <hi>Approbation</hi> is <hi>after;</hi> and not <hi>before</hi> it. From whence 'tis natural to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, That he <hi>approve's</hi> not of the <hi>Council,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Infallibly good,</hi> and therefore <hi>currant;</hi> (it would not then <hi>need</hi> his <hi>Approbation:</hi>) But the <hi>Council</hi> is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>currant,</hi> becauſe <hi>He approve's</hi> it. And why ſhould <hi>That</hi> be <hi>ſaid,</hi> unleſs becauſe He is <hi>Infallible</hi> with <hi>them</hi> that <hi>ſay</hi> it? Thus (I ſay) it is to <hi>Them,</hi> not Thus in <hi>it ſelf.</hi> For then there would follow this other Abſurdity, That if The <hi>Council</hi> hath <hi>err'd,</hi> it is becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> hath <hi>not approv'd</hi> it. For let him but <hi>approve,</hi> and It hath <hi>not err'd,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath every thing required to its <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> If not, let them ſpeak; for I argue only <hi>ad homines,</hi> and (out of very great charity) try to make them <hi>aſham'd</hi> with their own <hi>Devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (to ſpeak a groſs Truth,) The <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> of a <hi>Council,</hi> when a <hi>Council</hi> hath <hi>done</hi> with its <hi>Conſultations,</hi> cannot poſſibly have the virtue to effect that <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Council</hi> ſhall <hi>not have err'd.</hi> For if it hath erred, it is <hi>erroneous,</hi> though He <hi>approve's</hi> it. If not, it is <hi>orthodox,</hi> though He <hi>reject's</hi> it. The <hi>Emperours</hi> who call'd <hi>the firſt</hi> and <hi>trueſt</hi> General Councils, did either not <hi>care for,</hi> or not <hi>expect</hi> his Approbation.

            <p>The Caſe therefore is thus,</p>
            <p>A paper was brought by a <hi>Roman Catholike</hi> to a Lady then in <hi>Norwich,</hi> for an Anſwer; She ſent for me then there, wiſhed me to Peruſe it and Anſwer it; I ſhrunk my ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; ſhe urged; I took it or undertook it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſoon a ſhort Anſwer; He replyed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: He then ſent me a Treatiſe; I ſent an Anſwer to it; He ſent another Treatiſe; I began an anſwer to that: but before I had done, He had done in the Poets phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This the Narrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now have I more work, to ſatisfie ſome Demands. And the firſt is, Why I was ſomewhat long in anſwering the ſecond <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I can ſay, Firſt, that it might have been longer ere I had Anſwered the firſt,
<pb facs="tcp:40740:17"/> becauſe a <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> Then length is anſwerable to length. And alſo I do freely Confeſſe that as I have too much of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which unfits me for Speech; ſo have I too little of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſhould fit me for Expedition: Neither could I ever cloſely apply my ſelf to this vaſt and voluminous Learning which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pretend to; but have been a rambler (if not at my Book yet) from my Book, upon the ſaddle, the ſeat of Health as he called it. And beſides, I have had other work in the Church. Moreover, though others upon the 5. of <hi>November</hi> did preach, yet I was a good while in durance for preaching upon the 5. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond demand is this, why I ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the papers? To this may I ſay with St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but it ſeemed, an Anſwer was looked for; the party from whom it came, dead; the cauſe publike; the firſt paper <hi>an Interpretative Challenge;</hi> ſome of his party <hi>have vaunted of a Conqueſt;</hi> ſome have wiſhed the Papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; I had power over my own papers, which could not goe out without his; It is ſomewhat ingenuous to give ſome account of our time out of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> though thoſe who took our places ſhould alſo in reaſon have
<pb facs="tcp:40740:18"/> taken theſe pains. And laſtly, adviſed I was hereunto by two Biſhops of Famous memory, who ſaw part of the papers. One of them the late Biſhop of <hi>Norwich;</hi> whoſe <hi>Life indeed was not ſo ſhort as his Style:</hi> But ſince his Style was ſo ſmooth and ſweet that he might be ſaid to have written his own Life in it, What uſe might he have been of now, if God had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? The other the late Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who was: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; who wanted nothing to make us happy now, but life; who was
<q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</q> And the former of theſe gave me his Letter for my Encouragement.</p>
            <p>A third Queſtion then, why ſo long ere they came out. To this may be Anſwered, that though they might have come out ſooner, they were, it ſeems, reſerved for better times. <hi>Sunt haec Trajani tempora,</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s ſenſe. <hi>A Diſcourſe of Faith, keeps now ſome time with the Defender of the Faith.</hi> And very good time it is for others who have been true to their King, to ſhew that they have not been falſe to Religion; and that they have not leered, as ſome have ſuſpected them, towards the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican.</hi> And yet alſo this is not very probable, <hi>Ex natura rei:</hi> for if Kings would think upon
<pb facs="tcp:40740:18"/> it, there might be no <hi>Popes;</hi> ſince if <hi>Popes</hi> could well help it, there ſhould be no Kings.</p>
            <p>But this alſo can I affirm, that the Tract of years, ſince it was done, hath not altered or ſwelled the Book by one word in the body of it; though ſomewhat might have been mended and ſomewhat might have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>And if yet great exception be taken at the Book, becauſe it is ſo great; I muſt ſay, that I know who could have prevented this: For if my Adverſary would have ſpared the Debate <hi>about the Faith of the Canon,</hi> he needed not to have blotted ſo much paper about the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Effect, ſuch as this, whether the <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum quod</hi> might be the <hi>Objectum quo,</hi> or the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of its own Knowledge.</hi> And yet it may be, he hath gotten nothing by it; ſince the Church without Scripture, ſignifies little.</p>
            <p>Me thinks if the underſtanding in its aſſent were a natural Subject to the will, it would not be improper for me to ſay, that I would believe much for Peace, in reverence to that of Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but ſince the underſtanding looks for Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in this Act, we muſt have it, as to Faith Divine from God, either in the Propoſition, or in the Concluſion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40740:19"/>
            <p>And therefore I deſire to ſtudy Truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, neither rejecting all that is ſaid, leſt I reject that which is true; nor receiving all that is ſaid, leſt I receive that which is falſe; and I ſhould be Diſpoſed rather to like the matter for truth, than truth for the matter of it: Becauſe otherwiſe, we love truth but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not upon its own account, as ſuch.</p>
            <p>So that if this their Infallibility (pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) were either proved or quitted, we might rejoyce in more hope of Peace to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If it were ſufficiently proved, we ſhould preſently yeild; if it were quitted, they might poſſibly yield. And I would the <hi>Pope</hi> would turn <hi>Patriarch</hi> again but untill it be Proved, and thank God for the <hi>Nicene</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and no more.</p>
            <p>To my Adverſary, if I have ſhewed my ſelf at all uncivil, I am very ſory for it: and what unhandſome Reflexions there are made by him (if any) upon me, I put up upon good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. If the pen at any time makes a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſally out unto a perſtriction of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is a Liberty which I had rather give than take. And his Papers are as well, and as whole printed as mine, and I am glad that they are printed in the ſame character, which is not uſual.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40740:19"/>
            <p>And if I have made in mine any blots (as very likely I have) about <hi>Iſidor Clarius,</hi> or any other Author, or Matter, I am very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to acknowledge it; it being not in my way to pretend to infallibilitie; nor my mind to affect the Reputation of him that was denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>It is enough to me to have given any hints to others for better uſe. If I have found any ſmooth ſtone out of the Brook of Scripture, Let ſome able Paſtour of the Church throw it at that <hi>Roman Goliah;</hi> and let it ſink into his <hi>Head;</hi> and let Saint <hi>Jerom</hi>'s <hi>Sword</hi> cut off not his <hi>Head,</hi> but his <hi>Headſhip.</hi> My inability yet will doe me this good, that it doth ſtrongly prove their Infallibility not to be good; which ſuch a Punie of the Church can go near to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe and ruffle.</p>
            <p>Towards an Epiſtle this ſufficient; ſince I think my ſelf not worthy to give any advice. Onely by my experience I may remind thee, that it is time for us to knit the vein again of the Spouſe of Chriſt, in the breach whereof our Adverſaries do ſo much triumph. This <hi>

Although herein he hath made a good amends, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our thanks, in that his bold intimations have drawn you forth into the light, and fetcht from you this your abundantly ſatisfactory Anſwer for his full Conviction, and the ſettling of unſtable minds in this buſie Controverſie. Certainly, there is not a greater Impoſture in all <hi>Rome,</hi> then in the name and plea of the Church; as our Learned Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> hath long ſince laid it out, or that wins more of weak and injudicious ſoules: For what a ſhort cut is here of all controverſies in Religion? what a ſure-ſeeming refuge for the ſoule? what a preſent and ſenſible Eviction of all gainſayers? The Catholike Church cannot erre; The <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Catholike; The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of that Church are as evident as infallible; The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ambiguous; The Church is clear and conſpicuous; we know where <hi>Rome</hi> ſtands; In the communion of that onely is ſalvation; Out of that Ark we drown; within it is perfect ſafety: May this be made good, Who would trouble his heart or his head with any further diſquiſition of truth? Who need to care for any other ſpiritual priviledge, then to be free of Rome? O eaſie ſecurity of our Faith! O cheap charter of aſſured Salvation! Whiles theſe plauſible impoſtors goe thus about to flatter their
<pb facs="tcp:40740:21"/> ignorant, and credulous Clients into a dangerous, if not dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, misbelief, putting this broken reed into their hands; you have thus ſeaſonably diſcovered, and checked their fraud, and cleerly ſhewn to theſe ſimple and miſ-taught ſouls, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it is for them to truſt to ſo crazie and perilous a ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which muſt needs in ſtead of eaſing, wound them.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not ſufficient (to make one a Catholick in point of faith) that he believe the ſame things which the Catholick Church believeth, unleſs the Catholick Church be alſo the Ground of his belief: for whoſoever doth believe any point up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other Ground, but only becauſe it ſeems to his private Judgment to be contained in Scripture, or to be in it ſelf true, yea though he ſhould believe in this manner every thing which the Church believeth, yet he would not be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, and ſo may be damned for want of faith.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon is, becauſe ſeeing that faith is, to believe a thing becauſe God revealeth it, and that there is no infallible way (without a Miracle) whereby God his Revelation cometh to us, but onely by the Churches Propoſition; it followeth, that we cannot believe any thing certainly upon the Motive of God his Revelation, unleſs our belief be likewiſe grounded upon the Churches Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the faith of a Catholick muſt conſiſt in ſubmitting his underſtanding, and adhering to the Church, and in believing every thing becauſe ſhe propoſeth it: for all other perſwaſions of our own diſcourſe are reſolved at laſt into our particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or elſe into the Judgments of other particular Men; and ſo cannot breed in us Catholick and divine faith; but only Opinion, or humane belief.</p>

            <p>THe Paper may be reſolved into a Suppoſition, and a Reaſon, and a Concluſion. To theſe in order.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, The Suppoſition, <hi>It is not ſufficient to make one a Catholick, that he believe the ſame things that a Catholick doth believe, unleſs the Catholick Church be the Ground alſo of his belief, &amp;c.</hi> (as in the Amplification of it.)</p>
            <p>This Suppoſition is indeed the main Poſition of the Pontificians, and that which is formally Conſtitutive of them in that Denomination; ſo that the Anſwer to it is not made as to a private Opinion, or the Opinion of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man, but as to the General Tenet of their Church, in the matter of it.</p>
            <p>In the Terms, the word <hi>Catholick</hi> is to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for if they mean thereby ſuch an one as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a Catholick, <hi>viz.</hi> one ſubject to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon its own Authority, It is very true, that None is ſuch a Catholick; but he that ſhall render his belief to them in all things upon this their Propoſal; and ſo whatſoever is the Material Object of their faith, yet the Formal Object is the Definition of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But if there be a true Senſe, upon ancient Account alſo, of a Catholick who doth not believe Articles of faith upon the Propoſal of the Church; then there may be (in a true ſenſe) a Catholick now, who doth not make the Church the laſt Reſolutive of faith: For where the Scripture was acknowledged the Rule of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners alſo, there the Authority of the Church was not the Determinative thereof: And that it was, will be made good, if it be deſired, by ſeveral Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But ſecondly, give it, ſuppoſe it, that None is a Catholick in a right ſenſe, but he that believeth what the Church believeth, becauſe the Church believeth it; yet the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> will not gain his purpoſe thereby, unleſs we would
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40740:22"/> grant this Suppoſition alſo, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholick Church, which indeed is meant in the Paper, though wiſely not expreſſed. But this ſuppoſition (that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholick Church) is not to be yielded, neither in regard of Comprehenſion, for that makes a contradiction; nor in regard of Dominion nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for other Churches have not ſubmitted themſelves to their Authority: this needs no diſproof from us, till it hath a proof from them.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, If we ſhould ſtand up to all that their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Church (in particular) doth propoſe, and if we ſhould aſſent to it upon their Account, we might be damned, not for our want of faith, but for Exceſs of faith in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Material, and for the Error of faith in the Formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: For we ſhould believe more then is true, if we ſhould believe whatſoever they believe, and ſomewhat alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Articles in the Apoſtles Creed. And we ſhould alſo believe upon the wrong Inductive, which is not the Authority of their Church (as we may ſee now in the Anſwer to the Reaſon.)</p>
            <p>The Reaſon hath in it ſomewhat true, ſomewhat falſe: True, <hi>that faith is, to believe a thing becauſe God revealeth it:</hi> Falſe, <hi>that there is no Infallible way (without a Miracle) of his Revelation coming to us, but by their Church (which they ſuppoſe to be the Church) its Propoſition.</hi> For if the queſtion be This, how ſhall we come to know whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the right Church, upon the Authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we muſt ground our faith? Wherein ſhall we termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate our belief hereof? In the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or not? We are to believe that (they ſay) which God hath revealed; but the Cauſe of our belief muſt be, becauſe the Church propoſeth it. So then, we muſt believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon her own teſtimony; and we muſt reſolve all into this, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the right Church, although it be neither a Revelation, nor a natural Principle, ſuch as this, that The Whole is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40740:23"/> greater then the Part; which indeed gave the Occaſion of that Check which was given to <hi>Rome,</hi> Greater is the Authority of the world, then of a City, <hi>Orbis, quam Urbis. [S. Jerom. in Ep. ad Evagrium.]</hi> Wherefore, <hi>if the faith of a Catholick muſt conſiſt in ſubmitting his underſtanding, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Church, and in believing every thing becauſe ſhe propoſeth it,</hi> (as is ſaid in the Concluſion) yet it is not neceſſary that this Church ſhould be the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For this (in proportion) would be to reſolve our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions into the Judgment of particular Men, becauſe a Particular Church; which (according to the Paper) makes no Catholick faith, but an Opinion, or humane belief.</p>

               <hi>IN the Paper received, the Poſition which I gave,</hi> It is not ſufficient, &amp;c. <hi>is diſliked, becauſe it makes the Catholick Church the Ground of our belief; but in truth I find no reaſon given for ſuch diſlike, or any thing ſaid againſt it, but what to me ſeems very ſtrange, and is this:</hi> If there be a true ſenſe, upon ancient account alſo, of a Catholick, who doth not believe Articles of faith upon the Propoſal of the Church, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Furthermore, the ſame Dr.</hi> Field <hi>(in the Epiſtle to his Treatiſe of the Church) profeſſeth thus,</hi> Seeing the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion are grown in number ſo many and in Nature ſo Intricate, that few have time and leiſure, fewer ſtrength of underſtanding to examine them; What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for Men deſirous of Satisfaction in things of ſuch Conſequence, but diligently to ſearch out, which among all the Societies of Men in the World, is that bleſſed Company of holy Ones, that houſhold of faith, that Spouſe of Chriſt, and Church of the living God, which is the Pillar and Ground of Truth, that ſo they may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her Communion, follow her directions, and reſt in her Judgment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For brevity, I will omit many other of our Adverſaries, who are of the ſame Minde, and will now preſs harder upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Surely, if we believe the Creed, the Church is</hi> holy; <hi>if the Scripture, She is the</hi> Spouſe <hi>of our Saviour without ſpot or wrinkle: which Eulogies, and, indeed, glorious titles would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well become her, if ſhe can teach us that which is falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Scripture alſo gives us theſe known doctrines and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> That the Church is the Pillar and Ground of Truth (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) That the Church is built upon a Rock, and the Gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt her (<hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 18.) He that will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as the Heathen and the Publican (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 17.) He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me (<hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16.) Loe, I am with you even to the Conſummation of the World (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 20.) I will ask the father, and he will give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you, the Spirit of truth (<hi>Jo.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16.) <hi>And again,</hi> yet many things I have to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them now: but when the Spirit of truth cometh, he ſhall teach you all truth (<hi>Jo.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.) <hi>(to omit many other the like paſſages is Scripture.)</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Now this Church, whoſe Authority is thus warranted, did praecede the Scripture, which for a great part thereof was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but upon Emergent Occaſions (as</hi> Field, Hook. Covel, <hi>and other our Adverſaries have confeſſed) which Occaſions had they not been, perhaps we never had known this Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suppoſe then we had lived in thoſe times, when there had been no ſuch Scripture; (as many did, ſome part thereof being not written above ſixty years after our Saviours Aſcenſion) Ought we not then to have believed the Churches tradition and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed word? This Church was called</hi> the Pillar and Ground of Truth, <hi>before the words were ſeen in writing: and the like I might ſay by the other places before cited, which are now in the Scripture, but were delivered by word of mouth to the Church, before ever they were written; by all which places the Authority of the Church is commended to us, and we referred to the ſaid Church, as a Guide in all our doubts: And all theſe words of God were no leſs to be believed and obeyed before they were written then ſince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Even the Scripture it ſelf is believed upon the Tradition and Authority of the Church (being part of the</hi> Credenda <hi>it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth) nor could we at this day have known which books were true (now Canonical) which Spurious, but by the Churches deciſion and Propoſal (as the ſaid learned Mr.</hi> Hooker, <hi>and other our Adverſaries do acknowledge.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, who doth not ground his belief upon the Church, upon what doth he ground it, but upon his own fancy, or private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, the true Sourſe and Nurce of all Hereſy? And ſuch as theſe may indeed be found upon ancient Account, as</hi> Helvidius, Vigilantius, <hi>and the reſt of Hereticks, as the Catholick Church did then account them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now to that which is inſinuated, That the Scripture was ſometime acknowledged</hi> the Rule of Faith and Manners, <hi>it is anſwered, that it is ſo now; but this doth no way hinder the Churches being the Ground of our Belief: for the Church is both the Ground of our believing the Scripture, and alſo the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Scripture (as is above confeſſed by our Adverſaries)
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:40740:25"/> and not private Spirit, which I can eſteem no better then a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical, if not a fanatical Opinion; and is Diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the words of the ſecond of St.</hi> Peter, (1.20.) No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Scripture is made by private interpretation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all this ſpoken here, and in the Poſition,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Church, is meant of ſuch a Church, as does truely deſerve the name of</hi> Catholick; <hi>and ſo it will appear, that all the diſcourſe in this paper I received of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, conſidered as a Particular Church, or any other Particular Church, is but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and Extravagant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now alſo I muſt aſſure the</hi> Anſwerer, <hi>that the</hi> Pontificians <hi>do not make the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>the formal Object of their Faith (as he doth impoſe upon them) for they acknowledge that to be</hi> the Revelation of God, or the authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing, <hi>which cauſes their Belief to the Supernatural and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and not (onely) Natural and Humane; as is the Belief that there is ſuch a City as</hi> Rome, <hi>or that there is a</hi> William <hi>the Conquerour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which kind of faith is All that Hereticks have, and All ſuch as do not ground their Belief upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot alſo but obſerve in the received paper, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly enough called</hi> Exceſs of faith <hi>(as it is there oppoſed to want of faith) to believe more then Neceſſary: for the Number of things believed does not alter the Nature of faith it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And laſtly, I muſt tax him of falſe alledging the words in the</hi> Reaſon, <hi>thus,</hi> there is no infallible way (without a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) of his (Gods) Revelation coming to us, but by their Church, <hi>whereas in the Paper delivered, it is</hi> the Church <hi>(ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from all Particular Churches, and meaning the true Church, which ſoever it is.)</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>THere is no great reaſon for me to rejoyn:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe you wave the Application of your Diſcourſe, as to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; which is not ordinary for thoſe of your Profeſſion when they ſpeak highly of the Catholique Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe I may let you alone to anſwer the firſt paper with your ſecond, as to the main of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the greateſt part of it hath one fault, not to conclude contradictorily.</p>
            <p>Yet in Chriſtian reſpects to Truth and You, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour meekly ſome return to your Reply, and (to differ as little as may be from you) I ſhall moſtly follow your own Order.</p>
            <p>In the beginning you diſlike my diſlike of the ground of Faith without giving you any Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I intended my anſwer as near as I could gueſſe to the deſign of your paper for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; by Obedience to the Biſhop whereof <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm Engliſhed,</hi> p. 65. 6, 7. doth deſcribe the Catholique Church. You will excuſe me then if I took the courſe to make my anſwer compendiouſly ſufficient to that drift, if you will hold with Papiſts herein. And if you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, you meant the <hi>Roman</hi> Church by the Catholique, then I have given you ſuch a Reaſon againſt your Poſition
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40740:26"/> as you will ſay nothing to. And you may conſider that you directed your paper as to a Proteſtant, who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed to a Catholique, but to a Papiſt; if you be a Papiſt why doe you diſſemble it to me? If you be not, why do we diſpute? And this Apology may be enough alſo to refute all your Objections againſt me, of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, and excurſions, and untrue Allegations, if you will take notice alſo of my Parentheſis.</p>
            <p>And now my Reaſon intimated in a promiſe ſhall be made good in performance. And ſince you will in the queſtion about the Catholique Church abſtract from the <hi>Roman</hi> and all other particulars, I ſhall give ſome account of Catholiques, who did not make the authority of the Catholique Church the ground and cauſe of their Beleef, whereby onely God his Revelation cometh to us infallibly (as you expreſſe your ſelf in your firſt paper,) but this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative they aſcribed to the Holy Scripture to be it, wherein and whereby we are infallibly aſſured of Gods Will, as to what we ſhould beleeve and do in order to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. That the authority of the Catholique Church is of uſe towards Faith, we deny not; but the cauſe and ground of Faith, and that whereby we are infallibly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind of the mind of God, is not the Propoſition of the Church, but the Word of God. And ſuch being the ſtate of the queſtion betwixt us, I ſhall, for your ſhower of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities you ſay you could power out againſt me, give you or ſhew you a cloud of witneſſes (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.1.) againſt you. Your ſhower could not wet me through, but <hi>this cloud may direct you home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> concerning the Church and Scriptures (as you may ſee by the 8.19, 20, 21. Articles, and therefore it is not my Opinion) will appear not to be new, but agreeable to ancient Catholiques, in your own eſteem.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſhall be Saint <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Have you appealed to Saint <hi>Irenaeus?</hi> unto Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſhall you goe. He in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40740:27"/> third book firſt chapter; firſt words thus; <hi>We have not known the diſpoſing of our ſalvation by any other then thoſe by whom the Goſpel came to us, which then indeed they preached, afterwards delivered it to us in the Scriptures, by the Will of God, to be the foundation and pillar of our Faith.</hi> So he. Now that which is delivered in Scripture by the Will of God to be the foundation and pillar of Faith, is the ground and cauſe of our Faith. And ſuch is the Goſpel, according to this Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>The next for us is <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> in the ſeventh of his <hi>Stromata,</hi> towards the end, in the 757. <hi>p.</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Edition. <hi>He which is to be believed by himſelf, reaſonably is worthy to be believed by the Lords Scripture and Voice, working by the Lord, inwardly to the benefit of men.</hi> So he. Then according to him, the Holy Scripture is not worthy to be beleeved by men, but men are worthy of beleef by it. And therefore that muſt ground our Faith, becauſe it is it whereby we beleeve others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith in the following words, <hi>Surely we uſe it as the Criterium for finding out of things.</hi> And therefore points are to be decided and determined by authority of it; which is his chief diſcourſe againſt Heretiques even to the end of that book. And if you pleaſe to peruſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, you ſhall find there that in his judgement the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church (which he alſo there commends) doth not conſerve it ſelf in that denomination by its own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but by the Rule of Scripture. Now that which rules the whole rules the parts; the Scripture rules the whole, then us.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Origen</hi> upon Saint <hi>Matthew, Hom.</hi> 25. <hi>We ought not therefore for confirmation of Doctrine to ſwear our own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and to bring into witneſſe thoſe which every one of us doth underſtand and think to be according to Truth, unleſs he ſhall ſhew them to be holy out of that which is contained in the Divine Scriptures, as in the certain Temples of God; what can be more to our purpoſe?</hi> Then the Scripture is the Ground of Doctrines: then of Faith.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40740:27"/>
            <p>As for <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> we need not his words, knowing his practice of holding the equality of the Divine Nature, in the ſecond Perſon, the Son of God, againſt all the World. Yet he ſpeaks, as he did, if you will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him about the Incarnation of the Word, at the latter end: <hi>But then having taken occaſion by theſe, if thou wilt read the Divine Books, and wilt apply thy minde to them, ſhalt learn out of them more plainly and more perfectly, the truth of what we have ſaid.</hi> So he. Now where the Truth is learned more plainly and perfectly, there is the ground of Truth. In the Divine writings is the truth of thoſe things more plainly and more perfectly learned.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> bring in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage in his Book of Praeſcriptions, a little after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, thus, <hi>Do we prove the Faith by the Perſons, or prove the Perſons by the Faith?</hi> And again, <hi>Faith conſiſts in the rule. You have the Law, and Salvation, by the obſervation of it.</hi> And ſoon after, <hi>To know nothing againſt the rule, is to know all things.</hi> And again, <hi>That which we are, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were from the beginning, we are of them before it was otherwiſe, before they were corrupted by you.</hi> So he, beſides other paſſages wherein he witneſſeth for us.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> giveth us alſo his voice, in his firſt Book to <hi>Gratian,</hi> chap. 4. in the beginning, thus, <hi>But I will not that you believe an Argument, O holy Emperour, and our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation; let us ask the Scripture, let us ask the Apoſtles, let us ask the Prophets.</hi> Then we are to be determined in our Belief by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo, (who for order of time ſhould have been put before) gives his verdict for us, in the beginning of his ſixth Sermon, concerning the Lords Prayer, thus, <hi>The Evangelical Precepts, moſt beloved Brethren, are nothing elſe but the Divine Magiſteries, the foundations of building, our Hope, the firmaments of corroborating our Faith, the nutriments of chearing our heart, the Gubernacles of directing our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the ſafegards of obtaining Salvation, which, while they do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40740:28"/> inſtruct, the Docile mindes of Believers upon Earth, bring them to the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> So the Father. Where you ſee the Scriptures are aſſerted immediately to be the Ground and Firmanent of Faith.</p>
            <p>Yea, neither doth Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeem to ſpeak onely for your cauſe. In the ſeventh <hi>Tome,</hi> in the third Chapter of the <hi>Unity of the Church,</hi> againſt the Epiſtle of <hi>Petilianus,</hi> in the beginning he hath theſe words, <hi>But as I began to ſay, let us not hear theſe things I ſay, theſe things thou ſayeſt, but let us hear theſe things the Lord ſaith. There are certainly the Books of the Lord, whoſe authority we both conſent unto, we both believe, we both are obedient to; there let us ſeek our Church, there let us diſcuſſe our cauſe.</hi> And ſoon after, <hi>Let thoſe things be taken out of your way, which againſt one another we recite not out of the Divine Canonical books, but otherwiſe.</hi> And ſoon after, <hi>Some may ask why I would have theſe things taken out of the way, ſince if they brought forth, your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is invincible;</hi> (he anſwers) <hi>becauſe I would not have the Church demonſtrated by Humane Documents, but by Divine Oracles:</hi> and ſo to the end of the Chapter, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus; <hi>therefore let us ſeek it</hi> (the Church) <hi>in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canonical Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now made good my words, to give you Catholick Teſtimonies on our ſide. Amongſt which Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> authority gives advantage to plant Arguments upon: thus:</p>
            <p>If in buſineſſes of diſpute we muſt hear what the Lord ſaith, not what man ſaith, then the Scripture is the ground, not humane authority.</p>
            <p>But let us not hear what I ſay or thou ſaiſt (ſaith the Father) but what the Lord ſaith. Again, Where we muſt ſeek the Church, there we muſt reſolve our Faith. But we muſt ſeek the Church in the Scriptures, as the Father ſaith. If the Church is to be proved by the Scriptures, then the Scriptures are the ground of Faith, becauſe they are the ground of the Church: there is no reſolution of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40740:28"/> Faith but in that which is indemonſtrable; therefore not in the Church, becauſe that is demonſtrated by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as he ſaith. Again, Divine Oracles are the ground of Faith: the Scriptures are the Divine Oracles, as he ſaith, as the Scripture ſaith, as Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith, in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>yrna.</hi> Indeed the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith Catholick is the Word of God, not the Word of Man. And proportionable the cauſe of this Faith, muſt be divine authority, not any authority of Man. As demonſtrative reaſon makes Science, ſo humane authority make Opinion: but Faith is an aſſent to that which is ſpoken by God as true, becauſe he ſpeaketh it: therefore the authority of the Church is not a mean apt to beget Faith, becauſe it is of another kinde, and cannot exceed the nature of humane authority, although it be the higheſt in the kinde, if it be repreſented in a lawful General Council. Yet even General Councils have erred, and therefore they cannot he the Ground of Faith. This is the prerogative of the Canonical books, as the Father and all Antiquity calleth them: but never did we hear of a Canonical Church. The Scripture is the Canon, is the rule, not the Church. The Church witneſſeth Truth. The Church keepeth Truth. The Church defendeth Truth. The Church Repreſentative in a Council, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth Controverſies authoritatively, not infallibly, and therefore bindes not unto Faith, but to Peace: not to Faith in the Conſcience, but to Peace in the Church; not affirmatively, that we ſhould ſay it is true, becauſe they ſay it; but negatively, that we ſhould not raſhly oppoſe it, as falſe, becauſe they define it as true. Hitherto we go for the honour of the Church Catholick, not Roman. And now I have given you ſome reaſon of our Faith.</p>
            <p>It followes now in your Reply; or indeed how can I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a Catholick (without a palpable contradiction) that doth not believe the Catholick Curch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay ſo too. But what from thence? To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40740:29"/> a belief that there is a Catholique Church (whereof part is triumphant in Heaven, part on Earth expectant) and to profeſſe my ſelf to belong to the Catholique Church, is not incluſive of your ſenſe, that the Catholique Church is the ground of our belief. We believe the Catholique Church grounded in the Scripture, or built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is not to your purpoſe, becauſe the Catholique Church, as it is an object of Belief, muſt be conſidered as inviſible; whereas you intend the Church as viſible, whoſe propoſals we muſt receive and ſubmit our underſtanding unto. For the Inviſible Church, or Church as Inviſible, cannot order us in our Belief, becauſe, as ſuch, it is not known to us.</p>
            <p>I come now to your Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>And your firſt witneſſe is Saint <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We yeild all to Saint <hi>Irenaus,</hi> nothing to you. We ſay, we ought not to ſeek amongſt others the truth, which we may eaſily take and receive from the Church, &amp;c. Yes, becauſe the Church is ſerviceable to the truth, by way of Miniſtery to deliver the Word of Truth, to keep the Word of Truth, to uphold the Word of Truth. And ſo we acknowledge the Church to be a ſufficient Treaſury of Truth, becauſe we have therein the Scriptures. But the Treaſury doth not make the Money true nor cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: for it is poſſible that there may be falſe Money in the Treaſury. Therefore we muſt not take it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe it cometh out from thence: and ſo the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not made true to us, or the ſenſe of it evidently credible to us, becauſe it is in the Church. But we muſt look whoſe Image and Superſcription the Doctrine hath, and whether it be right coyn or not; and it may ſeem to be of the right ſtamp and yet not. Therefore ſaith <hi>Origen</hi> in his 34. <hi>Hom.</hi> upon <hi>Matth. All Money,</hi> 1. Every word that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40740:29"/> hath the Royal ſtamp of God, and the Image of his Word upon it, is lawful. Therefore we muſt bring it to the Word for trial. We confeſſe we may take out of her the drink of Life; yes, but as out of a ciſtern, ſuch water as cometh from the Fountain, the Scripture: and we drink out of the Scripture the Water of Life, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We deny not this to be the entrance of Life, becauſe we have here the means of grace adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>And all without the Church we ſay are thieves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and they ought to be avoyded. Yes, All without the boſome of the Catholick Church, which would break her Peace, and rob her Treaſury, are as thieves and robbers, and ought to be avoyded. We grant that thoſe things which are of the Church, as being true from Scripture, in points of faith; or not repugnant to Scripture in things of Diſcipline, are with great diligence to be loved. And we allow it, that the tradition of Truth is to be received. Yes, thus, the tradition of Scripture, the word of Truth, or the Truth delivered in writing; for ſo Tradition not ſeldome ſignifieth. Or tradition of Truth, which is according to Scripture, as the Apoſtles Creed. Not that whatſoever is delivered ſhould be Truth, (as you would have it) but whatſoever Truth is delivered, ſhould be received. This is all that place as ſeemeth to me will afford.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Teſtimony from the ſame Father, may it ſelf anſwer the Objection of the former, and may confirm my anſwer. Onely let me adde that he ſpeaketh of the Church then purer then now. If you will have more ſaid to this, you may find it in Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> authority, which you produce next.</p>
            <p>The Church (Catholick) alwayes holdeth, (not maketh) that which ſhe firſt knew. Where? in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Where elſe? And where the Church holds that which it thus knew, we hold with it, and are beholden to the Church for holding it forth to us. The Church may inform us of it; but it doth not certifie it to us: therefore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40740:30"/> doth not infallibly conveigh it (the Truth) to us: therefore is not the ground of Faith. The Office of the Church is as a Candleſtick to hold the Light of the Word of Truth. And moreover, though is did alwayes hold that which it knew, might it not alſo hold ſomewhat which ſhe did not know? Though it did hold that which was true, might it not hold that which was falſe in other things? As the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds many things which are true (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we differ not) and alſo many things falſe, wherein ſhe exceeds the Catholick Faith, as in regard of Object. Now put caſe therefore that that ancient Church near the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times did not hold any point falſe, but did hold Every point true: yet even from hence nothing will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſufficiently to your purpoſe, unleſſe you can prove that it was appointed by God to be the ground of Faith by an impoſſibility of errour in any particular. Such is to be the ground of our Faith: which is wanting in the Church, not privatively, as if it had been ever promiſed; but Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, becauſe not promiſed to the Church after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times. If it were poſſible that the Church might not erre, yet this would not make us reſt our Faith in it. Faith hath no ſure footing in ſuch contingencies of Truth; unleſſe you prove a non-poſſibility of erring, you doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>But we come now to the ſignal teſtimony of this kind, that of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I would not beleeve the Goſpel, unleſſe the authority of the Church did move me.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, if the teſtimonies of the other Fathers be defective in clearneſſe or fulneſſe as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the teſtimony of one ſingle Father (though excellent) will not amount to the Verdict of the whole Church: and you have no Fathers yet for you, for any thing I ſee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take this paſſage by it ſelf, and it ſeems to ſpeak high, but conſider it with the tenour of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the whole chapter, and it is like you will begin to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40740:30"/> think that it comes out from him in ſome heat of ſpirit to overcome his adverſary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you will be pleaſed to give me leave to uſe a <hi>Criticiſme,</hi> which admitted according to the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, will ſomewhat change the property of this ſuffrage. It appeareth by compare of places in <hi>African</hi> writers, that (as is obſerved) their manner was to expreſſe the tenſe more then paſt by the imperfect; and alſo that he in other places muſt ſo be underſtood. And if ſo here, then it muſt refer to him as when he was a Manichee; he was moved then, as ſuch, by the authority of the Church to the embracing of the Goſpel. And ſo we grant that the authority of the Church doth move to beleeve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But this cometh not to the caſe in hand, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for particular points of faith, whether we ſhould ground our faith of them in the Scripture, and not in the propoſal of the Church. Neither is this an univerſal way (as is pretended) of coming to the beleef of the Scriptures by the commendation of the Church: for ſome have been added to the Church immediately from the word, as in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> at the preaching of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> as is noted.</p>
            <p>And yet fourthly, mark the terms. It is not ſaid I would not believe the Goſpel unleſſe the authority of the Church did cauſe me, but unleſſe the authority of the Church did move me. And thus this Teſtimony doth very well agree with our Opinion. The authority of the Church might move him, although he did ground his Faith in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. And this is illuſtrated by the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> beleeving Chriſt through the teſtimony of the woman; but when they came to Chriſt and ſaw him, <hi>They ſaid unto the woman, we believe no more for thy ſaying, for we have heard and ſeen that he indeed is the Saviour of the world, the Chriſt,</hi> John 4.42. So Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> might be moved by the voyce of the Church to give an ear to the Truth of the Goſpel and yet was ſettled in the Beleef of it from its ſelf by the Spirit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40740:31"/> of God. When he did beleeve the immediate cauſe of his Divine Faith was from the Goſpel by the Spirit of God; although before he did beleeve, he was moved to think well of the Goſpel by the authority of the Church; So he did not belive the Goſpel by the authority of the Church, as a Theological principle, but as an outward mean and help thereunto. For the authority of the Church could not by its teſtimony of the Goſpel make it properly credible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the teſtimony of the Church is to be made true by it. And if it be not true in it ſelf, then the teſtimony is falſe. So that before we know whether the Goſpel be true, we know not whether the teſtimony of the Church be true. As alſo we cannot tell how to beleeve that the Church ſhould alwayes give a true teſtimony (as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) in every point, but by the Scripture. And therefore there is no ground or reſt for Faith, but in the Scripture. Since, if we beleeve the Church becauſe the Scripture gives teſtimony of it, and then the Scripture becauſe the Church gives teſtimony thereof, we muſt firſt beleeve the Scripture before we beleeve the Church. Therefore we muſt terminate our Faith in the Scripture, and if we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, beleeve it for it ſelf; it being the firſt credible.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Look to the end of that chapter, and there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had diſputed ſubtilly, he doth conclude ſoberly, But God forbid that I ſhould not beleeve the Goſpel, and then concludes againſt his Adverſary from thence, (as the rule of the difference betwixt them) for, Beleeving that (ſaith he) I do not find how to beleeve you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Scripture is the Rule he went by, you may ſee in his 32. chapter againſt <hi>Creſconius,</hi> whether let me if you pleaſe refer you for brevitie. <hi>None can overcome S.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>but S.</hi> Auſtin.</p>
            <p>And therefore I need not ſay any thing to the ſecond teſtimony, which is taken out of him againſt <hi>Creſconius.</hi> Yet obſerve, Although of this there is no example certainly brought forth out of the canonical Scriptures, yet alſo we keep the Truth of the Holy Scriptures, in this when we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40740:31"/> do that which hath pleaſed the whole Church, ſaith he, Namely in that which is not a ruled caſe in Scripture, as the queſtion was about the Truth of the Baptiſme of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; It ſeems then, if it had been determined in Scripture there had been an end of it, that becauſe the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot deceive, ſaith he: And this property abſolute belongs to it, not to humanitie. Whoſoever doth fear to be deceived by the obſcurity of the Queſtion, may ask counſel touching it of the Church, whom without doubt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf, doth ſhew, ſaith he. Firſt here is an obſcure queſtion about practice: ſo are not all points. Some are clear in Scripture, and yet the Propſition is univerſall, that we muſt believe every thing by the propoſal of the Church, as if we muſt beleeve nothing but what the Church defineth: and whatſoever it doth define, that we muſt beleeve.</p>
            <p>Secondly, VVe ſhould ask counſel onely, which doth not ſuppoſe an abſolute determination.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (which Church) the Scripture doth without doubt ſhew; then the Church is to be proved by Scripture again. And without doubt doth ſhew, but doth not ſhew to be alwayes without doubt, and infallible.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he afterwards goeth about to prove it againſt him by teſtimonies out of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But, behold, yet again in a third Teſtimony of Saint <hi>Auſtin, No peaceable man will be againſt the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> is again welcome, I ſay ſo too, and ſhall anon end with the whole Sentence.</p>
            <p>And yet once more in a fourth Teſtimony, Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> It is of moſt inſolent madneſs to diſpute againſt that which the whole Church holdeth.</p>
            <p>VVe anſwer, VVe ſay ſo too, in things of indifferency, which every particular Church hath power in for it ſelf, and the Catholicke Church for all. And yet all Catholick pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are not now obſerved by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as for one, Infant Communion. But according to the Father, if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40740:32"/> the Authority of the Scripture doth preſcribe, which of theſe is to be done, it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we ſhould do ſo as we read. In ſuch things then which are defined by Scripture, we know what we ſhould do intuitively to Scripture, without asking counſel of the Church. As certainly I may believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, that he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, immediately out of Scripture, and not upon the Churches propoſal.</p>
            <p>And now I have delivered you from your fear of my rejecting the Fathers. Surely we ſhould love the Fathers though they were our Enemies, and we have no reaſon to fear them when they are our Friends. Therefore, if you pleaſe to give me leave ſo far, let me ſay as <hi>Nilus</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> (as the Book bears title) ſaid, (in his firſt Book about the Primacy of the Pope, or the difference between the Greek and Latin Churches) It is very unreaſonable that you who have not the Fathers for your examples, ſhould of your ſelves underſtand that which is better, and we who have the Fathers ſhould not.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, in your Reply, you come to upbraid me with Devotion to modern men. But this Belief of yours concerning me is not well grounded: we delight not our ſelves in being Servants to Men in matters of Faith. What is true we like in any, what is not true, we do not like in any. In Divine writings we take all, for there we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not ſo much what is ſaid, as who ſaith: in Humane Writings we pick, for we conſider not who ſpeaketh, but what is ſaid agreeable to the Scriptures. Therefore with them we deal, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> with Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the forenamed chapter againſt <hi>Creſc.</hi> What we find in them which is agreeable to the Canonical Scripture, we receive with commendation, what doth not, with their leaves we leave.</p>
            <p>But to make as ſhort work with them as I can, I anſwer,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40740:32"/> firſt, as many teſtimonies and more clear might be found in them againſt you, I hope if thoſe teſtimonies be for you, let one be ſet againſt the other. And if you ſay I ſhould be moved by them, becauſe they are ours I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Secondly, If they agree with the ſenſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, you cannot condemn them: if they do not agree, we do. Thirdly, It is poſſible to be Even with you in the ſame kind, by a retaliation of <hi>Pontificians</hi> againſt you: But Fourthly, I could finde in my heart not to ſay a word to them, that you might ſee I do not give them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as to the Fathers. And yet, take the ſtrength of all their authorities together, and make of them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulative argument (as we may ſpeak) yet they do not conclude your cauſe. <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Schollar, in their ſayings, affirm no more then that which we acknowledge (not from them) that the Church ſhall by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, be ſufficiently furniſhed with neceſſary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine unto Salvation, but thoſe of the Church inviſible may be ſaved, though the Church viſible be not Infallible, and by conſequence not the ground of Faith.</p>
            <p>As for Doctor <hi>Saravia</hi>'s paſſage, I anſwer, it doth not come up cloſe to your purpoſe. The <hi>H. G.</hi> which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rule in the Church (objectively) is the true Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture: and thus it is not for you. And if you underſtand the Church (objectively) yet firſt the matter he ſeems to ſpeak to, is of Diſcipline about Government of the Church, depending upon Primitive Example: but we are upon points of Faith. Secondly, He cannot be contrary to himſelfe, when he acts as he did formerly in the time of the Apoſtles: but whether he doth ſo act now is a queſtion, yea no queſtion. Thirdly, If you will with him, and from him, draw the Government of the Church to be proportionably Epiſcopal, with all my heart. I reject them that reject it.</p>
            <p>And your Adverſaries of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> confeſſe nothing for you. The rule (they ſpeak of) namely Prophetical,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40740:33"/> and Apoſtolical preaching, &amp;c. it is the Word of God written, according to which ſhe is bound to interpret thoſe places which are obſcure, and to judge of Doctrines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule which ſhe hath received, ſo as her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations are to be agreeable to the analogy of Faith, and her judgements of Doctrines to be made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of the Word: namely, harder places are to be expounded by thoſe which are more plain, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies to be decided by that rule. And all this makes nothing for you. For thus the Scripture is the Rule ruling, and the Church is but the Rule ruled. And thus we follow the Church as the Church followes the rule, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be ye followers of me as I am of Chriſt,</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> c. 11. v. 1.</p>
            <p>Or if thoſe <hi>Lutherans</hi> mean by a certain rule any rule diſtinguiſhed from Scripture; it is to be underſtood of ſome general heads of Chriſtian Doctrine, in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereunto, doubtfull places and Doctrines were to be judged. But thoſe heads were to be gathered out of Scripture. And ſo all is reſolved towards belief in Scripture, but I think no man can ſee how they ſhould ſay ſuch a rule, which was not Scripture, was confirmed by miracles. So for them.</p>
            <p>And for Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> if you will go through the twentieth chapter of the fourth Book, you ſhall finde nothing in him contrary to this Doctrine. For he ſaith plainly, that though the Canonical Books are received by way of Tradition, yet the Scriptures have not their authority from the approbation of the Church, but they win credit of themſelves, and yeild ſatisfaction to all men of their Divine Truth: whence we judge that the Church which receiveth them is led by the Spirit of God. Obſerve, not becauſe the Church is led by the Spirit of God, therefore doth he ſay ſhe receiveth them, but becauſe ſhe receiveth them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we judge ſhe is led by the Spirit of God. And
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40740:33"/> as for his Rule of Faith deſcending by Tradition from the Apoſtles, what is he like to mean but <hi>the Apoſtles Creed,</hi> which he ſaith there, was delivered in the Church as a Rule of her Faith? But even this binds not by authority of the Church, or upon Vertue of Tradition, but by proportion to Scripture, where it is found in particulars of matter, though not in form of a Creed. We confeſſe alſo that we ſhould ſearch out the true Church, as the ſame Doctour ſaith. We confeſſe that the Catholick Church is the Houſhold of Faith, the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Church of the Living God; and that we ſhould embrace her Communion, and reſt in her judgement. Yes, but how? Not ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not abſolutely, not in what ſo ever ſhe ſaith, becauſe ſhee ſaith it: but in what ſo ever ſhee ſaith from the Lord. For although ſhe doth goe by an infallible Rule, yet are we not ſure ſhe goeth by it infallibly. Therefore, though wee reſt in her judgements as to Peace, yet can wee not reſt in her judgements as to Truth: becauſe our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are not free to aſſent to what man will; as being bound to aſſent to that onely which is grounded in the Word of God in matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>And now might I Vie with you in number of Pontificians againſt you. See <hi>Durand</hi> in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue upon the Sentences, where he hath more to our purpoſe then is neceſſary to be Tranſcribed. Read him your ſelf: <hi>Gerſon</hi> alſo in his Sermon concerning Errours againſt Faith and Manners about the Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>More freely, more purely, more truely, more ſpeedily is Truth found out, and Errour reproved, if the Divine Law alone be conſtituted as Judge; according to the conſideration of</hi> Ariſtotle; <hi>He which makes the Law the Judge, makes God: but he that addes Man, addes a Beaſt.</hi> Panormitanus alſo upon the 5. of the <hi>Decret.</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40740:34"/> almes in chap. <hi>qualiter &amp; quando, The ſaying of any Saint eſtabliſhed with the Authorities of the New or Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is preferred before a Papal Conſtitution, even in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Cauſes.</hi> Alſo <hi>Ferus</hi> upon the 1 <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> 2. chapter in the 52.3. page of the <hi>Antuerpe</hi> Edition, thus; <hi>The Holy Ghoſt doth teach tis by the means of the Holy Scripture and Word.</hi> Again, <hi>The Holy Scripture is given to us as a certain ſure Rule of Chriſtian Doctrine.</hi> And again in the ſame page, <hi>For if having the Holy Scripture as a moſt certain Rule of Chriſtian Doctrine ſet before our Eyes, we notwithſtanding, teach things ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, what would be done, if the Scriptures were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?</hi> And if you ſay now that there is added to thoſe places Tradition, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition after the <hi>Trent Council,</hi> as is noted; You will get nothing by that, but ſhame to the <hi>Pontificians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, I think, I am not much behind hand with you in Teſtimonies about the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>But then afterwards you preſſe harder upon me. So you ſay; but I do not yet feel the weight of any thing you ſay. I beleeve the Creed, and that the Church is Holy. And I do not beleeve, but know that from hence nothing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your cauſe. The Catholick Church makes not it ſelf the ground of Faith, but is grounded in it as before. And how were the firſt Members of the Catholick Church made Chriſtians, but by the Word of God? And from the Holyneſſe of it doth not follow infallibility by the <hi>Roman</hi> diſtinction which ſaith that the Pope may erre, as to his own perſon, but not in matters of Faith as to the Church.</p>
            <p>I beleeve that the Church is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and that ſhe is without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, as to that part which is in Heaven, and that the other part of the Church as inviſible which is not yet in Heaven ſhall be without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, when it cometh up to Heaven. But I do not beleeve that that Text is meant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40740:34"/> of the Church viſible. For all here glorious, or none: not all glorious here, therefore none. For you find it in the Text, that it is to be preſented as a glorious Church, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly as in the whole. But you will not ſay, that every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the viſible Church is here glorious without ſpot, without wrinkle or any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>If you do ſay ſo, you contradict <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his third Book <hi>of the Militant Church,</hi> the ſecond chapter, who there includes <hi>in his Definition of the Church viſible,</hi> even Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates wicked and ungodly men; and requires there no internal virtue for the conſtitution of a Member of the Church, but onely an external profeſſion of Faith, and communion of Sacraments. And beſides you know glory, which is a perfection of Grace, doth not belong to the way, but the Country in Heaven. And beſides, if you will not beleeve me in ſuch an Expoſition, beleeve your <hi>Eſtius,</hi> who with<note n="*" place="margin">In his <hi>Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations,</hi> p. 9. <hi>Ed. Frob.</hi> but this Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not added in my copy to him.</note> Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> underſtands it, upon good Reaſon of the Church inviſible; as you may ſee in <hi>Eſtius</hi> Comment upon the place. And here by the way we have another Teſtimony of your own againſt you, if you account your Argument from this Text ſufficient to your cauſe. And we have St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> authority to boot, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> quotes him. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Holyneſſe is no formal principle of our direction, eſpecially in points of Faith. It is Holy becauſe it follows, and as it follows the Rule, and ſo ſhould we in faith and manners. And therefore if it were to be underſtood of the Viſible Church (as it is not) yet you conclude nothing for your turn upon this conſideration.</p>
            <p>To haſten, the next Text is formerly urged, <hi>the Church the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> Yet ſqueeze it, and preſſe it, and make the beſt uſe of it you can, it will not afford your inference you would make from it.</p>
            <p>For firſt, ſome, and alſo very reaſonably, will refer this Expreſſion not to the Church, but to the Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40740:35"/> which follows; and ſo they make it as an <hi>Hebrew</hi> form of ſetting out ſome high point and grand Doctrine; and then it goes thus: <hi>A Pillar and Ground of Truth, and without Controverſie, a great Myſtery of Godlineſs is this,</hi> (namely) <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. If ſo, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe in it is ſunk, and indeed the copulative, [And] <hi>(and without Controverſie)</hi> doth not ſeem ſo well and ſo cloſe to knit elſe. But it being given, not granted, that that <hi>Criticiſme</hi> is not ſufficient, what of all that? For Saint <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as before, gives this Eulogy to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Scripture gives it to the Church. Now to which doth this propertie belong firſt and abſolutely? To the Scripture or to the Church? Not to the Church, for the Church hath it from the Scripture. Now that which hath it firſt, hath its abſolutely, and independently upon that which follows: therefore the Scripture is the abſolute Pillar and ground of Truth. Then there Faith hath ſure footing; there it ſits down, there it reſts; on that Ground, upon that Pillar. The Church then hath this Title but ſubordinately; and what it ſaith cannot bind, but conditionately to that which is the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Ground and Pillar of Truth For the Truth is the Pillar and Ground of the Church, as Saint <hi>Chyſoſtome</hi> ſaith upon the place.</p>
            <p>Take it then of the Catholick Church (not <hi>Roman</hi>) The Text doth more ſet out the Office of the Church, then the authority. It doth hold, it doth propoſe, it doth uphold the Truth; but this doth not convince or evince, that whatſoever the Church doth hold, we ſhould alſo hold, and upon that account alſo; as if God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Church infallibly to conveigh to us whatſoever Truth; and nothing but Truth. And therefore may we and ought we to ſearch the Scriptures, as our Sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. and by them <hi>examine whatſoever the Church ſaith,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Beraea</hi> did, that which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40740:35"/> was ſaid by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and they commended for it.</p>
            <p>And therefore we cannot believe the Definitions of the Church upon its own word. Nay, can we alſo ſay, that God doth now give unto the Church ſuch aſſiſtance, as then, which was noted before? and therefore we diſtinguiſh times, not thinking there ſhould be as much ſaid of the Church now, as when it included the Apoſtles; and therefore ſuppoſing that the Church then did hold all that was true, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary: yet we cannot ſay it of the Church now, and therefore is not the cauſe of Faith, under whoſe authority it muſt alſo paſſe, beſide the Divine Revelation to make it Catholique. For the Church is conſerved by the Truth, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> alſo upon the place, then thus; where the ground of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church is, there is the ground of Catholique Faith: The Scripture is the ground of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, unleſſe it be conſerved by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle then by which it is conſtituted. And it is conſerved by the Truth, ſaith he, and thy word is Truth, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. And whereas he ſayes, that the Truth ſuſtaineth the Church, and the Church ſuſtaineth the Truth, and ſo one is the cauſe of the other; we anſwer, this is not availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for you. For in the ſame kinde of cauſe it cannot be, for then we are in a circle, but the Truth ſuſtains the Church, ſo as to continue it in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: the Church ſuſtains the Truth but by way of miniſtery, which doth not make it to be a principle of Faith, no not to us.</p>
            <p>Neither do the other Texts ſpeak for you as you would have them. If the gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the Church, it doth not follow that then Catholique Faith muſt be built upon the propoſalls
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40740:36"/> of the Church. Nothing ſhall prevail to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of thoſe, who belong to the Church of God, as inviſible, and nothing ſhall prevail, not the Gates of Hell, againſt the Church viſible, ſo as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where or other there ſhall not be ſome who ſhall profeſſe the Chriſtian Doctrine and Worſhip ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The next Text ſpeaks towards Excommunication, which comes little into the queſtion: for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church may proceed to Cenſure, although we be not bound, upon peril of want of Faith to ſubmit our underſtandings to the definitions of the Church. As to the authority we may ſubmit, ſo as to endure the cenſure, though we do not ſubmit our judgements, as to believe the definitions.</p>
            <p>As to the next place of Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. We ſay firſt, this ſeems not to be rightly applyed to the buſineſſe we are about, for this was directed not to the Governors of the Church, but to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Diſciples or Elders, which were ſent by Chriſt to preach the VVord. Secondly, If you doe extend it to the Repreſentative Church, yet doth it not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſubjection of judgement alwayes, to whatſoever is ſaid; but not to deſpiſe them, as is intimated by what followes, <hi>and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> VVe may differ without deſpiſing. And Thirdly, If you will from hence argue, that whatſoever was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in a Council, was alſo determined by Chriſt, then <hi>Honorius</hi> was by Chriſt determined an Heretick, as you may ſee in the practicks of the ſixth Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Synod, as <hi>Nilus</hi> in his ſecond Book. And if you ſay that the Church cannot erre in a General Council, then reſolve <hi>Nilus</hi> the reaſon why the Pope doth not hear a General Council; for if that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council did not erre, (as by your argument it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40740:36"/> muſt not) then the Pope did erre. As for the other places of Holy Scripture, which you produce, of <hi>Chriſts being with his Church to the end of the world, and of his promiſe of leading his Church into all truth:</hi> VVe anſwer together.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though the promiſe be extendible to the end of the world, yet it is not neceſſary to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, ſo, as that there ſhall alwaies be equality of aſſiſtance to the times of the Apoſtles, which is hard to affirm, ſince we cannot ſay that there is ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for ſuch aſſiſtance, or ſuch diſpoſitions in the Governours of the Church to receive ſuch aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Promiſe is made good by a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient direction of the Church to their end of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, although not without poſſibility of error. For every ſimple error doth not deprive the Church of Salvation, and then it may alſo recover it ſelf from errour, by more peruſal of the Scriptures. But if it may at all erre, it hath not the property of a ground of Faith, nor a juſt capacity of an Infallible communication of all things which are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p>You go on. Now this Church, whoſe Authority is thus warranted, did precede the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> VVarranted, as a Church, but not as ſo, not as Infallible.</p>
            <p>Did precede the Scriptures, which for a great part were written upon emergent occaſions, as you ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for the writing of Scriptures, and the emergent occaſions, you may be further referred to Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> whom you made uſe of againſt me. VVhatſoever the occaſion was, the end was to make what was written a ſufficient rule of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40740:37"/> And as for your objection and inference upon it: VVe anſwer with a diſtinction; the Scripture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable two wayes, either in reſpect to the ſubſtance of Doctrine; or ſecondarily in reſpect to the manner of delivery by writing: in the firſt regard the Scripture did precede the Church; for the Church was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by it, which to them was as certain as the written to us. And if you could make your Traditions, of proper name, equally certain, you would ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. And as for Scripture, that which is written doth binde, though it doth not properly binde, as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>You ſay that the Church was called the Pillar and ground of Truth before it was written, and ſo you ſay might be ſaid of other paſſages.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, As that place expreſſed it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us that it was ſo called, ſince firſt we find it in termes, in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle. But if ſo, or other like were uſed before; the anſwer before will ſerve.</p>
            <p>By all which places the authority of the Church is commended to us, and we are referred to the Church as a Guide in all our Doubts. So you ſay, and ſo we ſay, Where is the Adverſary? How doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude contradictorily? We confeſſe that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church is commended to us in Scripture; but not directly in every place you name; nor in any is it ſo commended to us as to ground our Faith. We confeſſe we are referred to the Miniſters for Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to the Governours for juriſdiction, yet are not the Latter Maſters of our Faith, unto whom we ſhould be bound in a blind Obedience of Univerſal aſſent or practice. We take their advice, but we are not by them determined in our Faith. We may beleeve what they ſay, but not becauſe they ſay it. As it is drawn
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40740:37"/> from Scripture, ſo it draweth us. If they make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it is ſo, becauſe they ſay it: yet it hath not the certainty of Faith without the Word of God. I ſhould be very tender of incompliance with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church: but yet I muſt have for my warrant of Faith, the Lord ſaith, <hi>And although there be no appeal from a General Council, yet have they no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible judgement.</hi> You proceed, even the Scripture it ſelf is beleeved upon the Tradition and authority of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This was touched before in the caſe of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and it is in effect anſwered, as before, by Doctor <hi>Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed we take the Canonical Books by Tradition from the Church: but we doe not take them to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical by Tradition from the Church. The authority of the Church moves me as to the Negative not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: but aſſent is ſettled to them as ſuch in the way of Faith, becauſe they are ſuch. <hi>In thy Light we ſhall ſee Light,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.9. or <hi>by thy Light;</hi> ſo <hi>by Scripture we ſee Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next follows the Expoſtulation, which may be put into this diſcourſe; Either we ground our beleef upon the Church, or upon our own fancy and private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> We deny your disjunction. VVe ground our beleef, neither upon the authority of the Church as you; nor upon fancy, neither as ſome have done who have been better friends to <hi>Romans,</hi> then they have been to us, as Doctour <hi>Whitaker</hi> told <hi>Campian</hi> upon a like imputation of <hi>Anabaptaſtical</hi> fancies.</p>
            <p>VVe differ from you, becauſe we allow to private Chriſtians a judgement of diſcretion, or diſcerning, which ſure is commended in that precept, <hi>Prove all things,</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 5.21. We
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40740:38"/> differ from thoſe who magnifie their private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, becauſe we ſay they ſhould be directed by their Miniſters, and ordered by the Biſhops, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of the Church, chiefly, when they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in a General Council, wherein is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt power of Oyer and Terminer as we may ſpeak, of hearing and ending differences in the Church; yet we cannot ſay that we are abſolutely bound unto their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, we having the judgement of private diſcretion, and they not the judgement of Infallibility. And if you cannot ſay that they are abſolutely without any doubt, but true; without doubt we can ſay that we ſhould not abſolutely beleeve them. Every poſſible defect of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the Object excludes Faith; the certainty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of admits no falſity. Therefore can we not preſently yeeld or aſſent to whatſoever is by them defined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may erre. As it was ſaid of the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> they were not fools, but they could doe fooliſh things: So though they be learned men, though great Divines, yet may they poſſibly propoſe that which is not ſo. They reaſon points by the Scripture: which was wont as is noted) to be laid in the middle, (when they were in Council,) but ſince they goe to diſcourſe from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in things doubtful, and doe not ſee all Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in principles of Scripture by way of Intelligence; it is poſſible for them not rightly to apply ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Scripture to ſome particular caſes. Therefore ſince they have not a power not to erre, we have a power to ſuſpend our Faith; nay we cannot give it without evidence of Truth. Yet ſince they have a power to order us, we have a Duty not. to oppoſe or diſturb. And thus this Doctrine makes way for Faith, not for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie; ſince we may differ from the Opinions of the Church, even defined, and yet not be Hereticks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the formality of the Heretick hath it ſelf in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40740:38"/> will, and wilful blindneſſe is more apt to make Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks then a ſober diſquiſition, which would know what it doth beleeve. For Beleef is not divided againſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but Science.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay afterwards in your Reply, that the Scripture is the Rule of Faith and Manners, and the Church the ground of our beleef nevertheleſſe;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, I am very glad you confeſſe that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Rule of Faith and Manners. But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will deſtroy your Poſition, that the Church is the ground of our beleef, in your ſenſe. For if that be our Rule Ruling, then our beleef is to be ruled by that. For as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in the 7. of his <hi>Stromata,</hi> ſaith in this matter, <hi>That Principle which needs another Principle, is not a Principle:</hi> ſo that Rule which needs another Rule, how is it a Rule? Is it an adaequate Rule or not? If ſo, then where are your Traditions? If not, how a Rule of Faith and Manners? Is it ſufficient or not? If ſufficient, then what neceſſity of your Propoſal of the Church, eſpecially for things neceſſary which are plain? If not ſufficient: then how a Rule of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? And if both the Scripture and the Church be both Grounds of beleef, then either coordinate or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Not coordinate, for then the voyce of the Church muſt be equal to the VVord of God, without the VVord of God: and who then will be guilty of the phanatical Spirit? If ſubordinate, then the principal ground makes the reſt of Faith. And when I know Gods Revelation in Scripture, what need I goe to the Church for authority or Interpretation? And beſides where there is need of Interpretation, although it doth belong to the Church to interpret, yet cannot we ground a beleef in that interpretation, unleſſe it did appear that the Church doth interpret infallibly: But this is not yet proved; &amp; therfore your reaſon is not valid. And if you ſay
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40740:39"/> the Church cannot erre, becauſe it goeth by the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the antient Fathers, do but conſider how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we can ſettle and fixe belief therein. For who hath read them all? yea, how few know them all? and who knowes whether he that doth know them and hath read them all, doth give us a right account of them? who can exactly diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe which are true, and thoſe which are falſe? who can accurately diſcern of the true Fathers, which pieces are true, which are foiſted in? who can perfectly judge all their idioms of ſpeech? who can reconcile the differences betwixt one and another? yea, who can compoſe the differences betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>And that Text which you produce of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> will do you no good, for we do not magnifie private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. We ſay private men ſhould adviſe with the Church: but are we ſure that ſhe hath hit the right ſenſe?</p>
            <p>But as for the Text, it is impertinently produced, if it be rightly interpreted, No Prophecy of Scripture is of private Declaration; and to this effect the Syriack: No Prophetical ſolution is of private writing, was not written by a private ſpirit, for ſo it beſt agrees with that which followes in the laſt verſe: for Prophecy was not brought to us at any time by the will of Man, &amp;c. And after the ſame manner doth <hi>Cajetan</hi> comment upon the place; he toucheth the difference between Sciences written, and Prophecies written, in this regard, that a Learned Man teacheth and writeth according to his own Interpretation, thoſe things which do appear in the light of his Agent intellect; but the Prophet doth ſay and write thoſe things which appear under the light of Divine Revelation, not according to the interpretation of his own judgment. So he. So then the Text relates to thoſe who wrote Scripture, not to thoſe who ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40740:39"/> it, being written. And beſides, when private Mendo interpret Scripture for themſelves, they are not to interpret it by private meanes, but by it ſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring place with place, and diſcerning the ſenſe of that which is obſcure, by that which is more plain. And if it be a paſſage that is very obſcure, and there be no other paſſage more clear to illuſtrate it; it is not like to be a point, without the belief whereof there is no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Well ſaid the Greek <hi>Nilus,</hi> to accuſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is all one, as if one ſhould accuſe God, but God is without blame.</p>
            <p>It followes in your Reply, and all this ſpoken here, and in the poſition, &amp;c. of the Church, is meant of ſuch a Church as doth truly deſerve the name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I ſaid enough to at the beginning. But you ſeem to be very loath to own the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to avouch her, and yet you would ſeem to manage the point, which they make much of, as they: as if you had ſome minde to be a true Catholique abſtractedly from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo indeed you may be in the antient ſenſe, as they uſed it for thoſe who were Orthodoxal. Yet for what Church you reſerve thoſe great titles, and what Church, in your eſteem, doth deſerve the name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, I know not. You are very cloſe in this. But let me now at leaſt conclude, that if the Catholique Church be not the ground of Faith in your ſenſe, ſurely the <hi>Roman</hi> is not.</p>
            <p>And now all that I have to do, is to juſtifie two expreſſions of mine, which you are pleaſed to carp at.</p>
            <p>The one is, that I ſaid the <hi>Pontificians</hi> do hold the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the formal object of their faith. You ſay that you muſt aſſure the anſwerer that the <hi>Pontificians</hi> do not make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (in its
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40740:40"/> propoſal) to be the formal object of their Faith (as he doth impoſe upon them) for that they acknowledge to be the Revelation of God, or the authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing, which cauſes their Belief to be ſupernatural or Divine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw,</hi> I am glad my expreſſion gave you occaſion thus to expreſſe your ſelf. See how you now differ from your ſelfe. Before, the ground of Believing was the authority of the Church: now the authority of God revealing the cauſe of their belief. Before, you concluded, Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſubmitting the underſtanding, and adhering to the Church, and in believing every thing, becauſe ſhe propoſeth it: now it is the authority of God revealing, which cauſes their faith to be Divine. As for the term, thus; the formal object is ſuch, under which, and in reſpect whereunto, any thing proceedeth; if then Gods Revelation cometh not to us under the Propoſal of the Church, or as propoſed by the Church, then the cauſe is loſt; if it doth, then grant me my term, and affirm with me that the Pontificians hold ſo. If not, they are better then you. And what means elſe their implicite faith, unleſſe we are to believe every thing as the Church believeth it (and becauſe the Church propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it as you ſaid) and if we be to beleive every thing as the Church believe it, then is the Church the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal object of their faith; ſince they are alſo bound not to doubt, but ſimply to obey, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us in his fourth Book of the Roman Biſhop, 5. chap.</p>
            <p>The other term you find fault with is, exceſſe of faith, You taxe it as improperly ſpoken: But ſurely it will paſſe without any Grain of Salt or of allowance, if we conſider that Faith may be compared as to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar object, and ſo there is not an Exceſſe of Faith as to that: but then it may be compared as to many objects, and ſo, though we do not more believe one thing then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40740:40"/> we ſhould, if we ſhould indeed believe it, yet may we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more then we ſhould If we believe thoſe things which are not at all to be believed. And thus, if we ſhould believe whatſoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, we might be deſtroyed for exceſſe of Faith. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is peccant in exceſſe of Faith by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more points then it ſhould believe, and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our Divinity is in negatives, as to differences with them, becauſe their Divinity in differences to us, is in additions.</p>
            <p>SIR, If you will excuſe me for being ſo long, I ſhall now conclude with the whole concluſion of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whereof you gave me but part. <hi>Againſt Reaſon no Sober Man will go, againſt Scriptures no Chriſtian,</hi> (then Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould go by Scriptures) <hi>againſt the Church no Peace-maker.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Romane Catholicks have often foretold, that by permitting freely to all ſorts of people whatſoever, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures in their Mother Tongue, multitudes of New Sects and Hereſies would not fail to grow up in numberleſs Number; and as for the Peoples Manners, they would dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow worſe and worſe. How true this is, let the world judge. That then which now mainly imports, is to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the true Religion from ſo many falſe ones. This is my Aim. To effect this, I did write a ſhort Paper, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catholick Church ſo to teach the infallible way to Salvation (which is to be obtained onely in the true faith) that we cannot have as things ſtand, any other Aſſurance to ground our faith upon ſecurely. I did never deny, that when by the Infallible Authority of the Church we are ſecured that the Scriptures be the word of God we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40740:41"/> believe ſuch things as are clearly contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: for ſo I ſhould deny that I could not believe that to be infallibly true, which upon an Infallible ground I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be Gods own word. But I did, and ſtill do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that no man can have Infallible ground to believe the Scriptures now, but he who firſt believeth that which the Church teacheth to be infallibly true: Whence it will follow, that his faith muſt needs now at the firſt be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Revelation of Gods truth, made by God to us by his Church, and not by his written word.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> St. <hi>Anſelme</hi> hath a very fit Similitude to expreſs how much a Contentious Spirit in diſputing doth blind the underſtanding from ſeeing the Manifeſt Truth. He ſayeth, that a little before Sun-riſing two men in the fields did fall into a hot debate concerning that place of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in which the Sun was that day to riſe, the one pointing out one part of the Heavens, the other another. They paſſed ſo far in their Contention, that falling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ears, they both pulled out one anothers Eyes, and ſo when the Sun by and by after did riſe, neither of them both could ſee a thing ſo clear as was the place of the Sun riſing. To our purpoſe; Becauſe Zeal in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is accounted laudable, and alſo becauſe prejudice, cauſed by Education in ſuch or ſuch a Religion, is a thing exceedingly ſwaying us to our own ſide, we are commonly apt to grow into ſo hot a debate in diſputations about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that I may freely ſay, This Paſſion hindreth many thouſands from ſeeing that clear Sun-ſhine of Truth, which men of mean Capacity would clearly behold, if ſetting all paſſion and prejudice aſide, they did with a Calm and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mind beg of God to give them this grace of ſeeking Truth with all ſincerity: for then he who ſhould ſeek, ſhould find.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This is proved manifeſtly and very comfortably for the vulgar ſort of leſs learned people (who make the greateſt Number of Souls in the world) by thoſe clear words of the Prophet <hi>Eſay (c.</hi> 35.) <hi>Say to the faint-hearted, Take courage and fear not, behold God himſelf will come and ſave you: then ſhall the Eyes of the blind be opened, and the Ears of the deaf ſhall be opened, and there ſhall be a Path and a way, and it ſhall be called the Holy way, and this ſhall be unto you a direct way, ſo that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> By this place it is evidently proved, that the way which our Saviour at his coming would teach us, ſhould be not onely in it ſelf,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40740:42"/> but (as the Prophet ſaith) <hi>ſhould be to us a direct way, ſo that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> Let there ariſe never ſo many Controverſies in Religion, let there ſpring up never ſo many Sects, yet the Promiſe of God will ſtand, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour at his coming ſhould ſhew us <hi>A holy way,</hi> which ſhould be unto us ſo direct a way that fools cannot erre by it. What <hi>Holy way</hi> is this? I ſay, It is the Holy Catholick Church, which even by this place is proved Infallible, <hi>A way ſo direct unto us, that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> But even wiſe men might erre by it, and by following it moſt faithfully, if this way could be fallible, and lead Men into Errours, and thoſe damnable.</p>
            <p>To our Purpoſe then; All Chriſtians of whatſoever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Religion they be, agree in this, That there muſt be One Judge of all Controverſies and doubts, which either be or can be in Religion. The Reaſon is apparent, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe every Man might be left free, to believe what he judged beſt, and ſo we ſhould have as many Religions as there be Private and different Judgments. For if you in private, without all fault may follow your own Judgment (even after reading of Scripture,) and believe that to be true which out of Scriptures you think trueſt, why may not I, though I judge quite contrary to you, believe that alſo to be trueſt which I think to be true according to the Scriptures? Whence you ſee that Chriſt ſhould have left a very Miſerable Church, and ſhould have gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a moſt heart-diſunited ſort of People, if after their reading of Scriptures, he had left them no other Judge but their own private Judgment. What Law-maker was ever ſo Inconſiderate, as to leave onely a Book of Laws to his Common-wealth, without any living Judge, to whoſe Judgment All were to ſubmit? True it is, that to ſubmit <hi>exteriorly</hi> to temporal Judges, is ſufficient, they being able and onely to judge of the Exterior Man. But God who ſearcheth the Reines and the Heart, and who looketh moſt upon the Mind (which is the Seat of True

He hath all reaſon to exact they be of One faith, for he could not ſeriouſly deſire their Salvation, without he required of them to do that, which is ſo wholly Neceſſary to Salvation, that without it no man is ſaved: For <hi>without faith it is Impoſſible to pleaſe God (Heb.</hi> 11.6.) that is, It is impoſſible to pleaſe him without true faith; for he is not pleaſed with falſe faith. But without we pleaſe God, it is impoſſible to be ſaved; therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true faith (which conſiſteth in the <hi>Interiour</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) it is Impoſſible to be ſaved. And St. <hi>Paul (Epheſ.</hi> 4.5.) teacheth us, that <hi>there is but one faith, one baptiſm, and one God.</hi> There being but One faith, and it being impoſſible to pleaſe God without this One faith, and all things neceſſary to pleaſe God being under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and of moſt ſtrict Obligation, it followeth, that it is a Precept and a ſtrict Obligation to have this faith, which chiefly and Eſſentially conſiſteth in the Interior Judgment. This I preſs ſo hard, becauſe my Adverſary hath a doctrine which I take to be exceedingly pernicious: for he ſaith, (Pag. 26. Anſw. 5.) <hi>We ſay, They ſhould be directed by their Miniſters, and ordered by Biſhops, the Paſtors of the Church, chiefly when they are aſſembled in a General Councel, wherein is the higheſt power of hearing and ending differences in the Church. Yet we cannot ſay, that we are abſolutely bound to their Canons, we having the Judgment of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diſcretion, and they not the Judgment of Infallibility; and therefore ſince they have not a power not to erre, we have a power to ſuſpend our faith,</hi> &amp;c. By theſe and many other words uſed to this Effect, you ſee here <hi>this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Private diſcretion</hi> left free in the <hi>Interiour,</hi> to hold what a Private perſon thinketh fit after peruſal of the Scripture, although a whole General Councel thinketh, and moſt unanimouſly defineth the Contrary, even after
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40740:43"/> they have heard and moſt diligently weighed and ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame places of Scripture. Good God! Is that thy Promiſe of a <hi>Holy way, that ſhall be to us a direct way, that fools cannot erre by it?</hi> Yea, is not the wiſeſt Man in the world moſt likely to erre in this way, by which he may in his Interior Judgment go quite Contrary to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? I know indeed that All who are not Roman Catholicks muſt ſay this: for if the Church in a General Councel be fallible, then we cannot ground one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> upon that Councels definition. But even by this deſperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it is evident that God would give his Church a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Infallible aſſiſtance, ſo to make good his Promiſe of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to them a <hi>Holy way, which ſhould be unto them a direct way, ſo that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> For any Man of mean Capacity cannot erre, if he will ſubmit his judgment to the Catholick Church; whereas any Man of never ſo great a Judgment, cannot but be highly ſuſpected of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and deeply guilty of expoſing himſelf to manifeſt hazard of Erring in that faith (without which it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God) when he doth not ſubmit his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Judgment to the known unanimous Judgment of the whole Church. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was a Prime Doctor of the Church, and yet grounding himſelf upon that which he judged to be Scripture (as appeareth by his firſt Book Ep. 6. and other places) he did erre groſsly about the neceſſity of Rebaptizing thoſe who had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Hereticks. But ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Bapt. (c.</hi> 4.) <hi>If he had lived to ſee the determination of a Plenary Councel, he would for his great Humility and Charity ſtraightway have yielded, and preferred the General Councel before his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thus ſpeaketh S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> though he knew <hi>his private Judgment of diſcretion</hi> to be far leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in this Caſe to hazard of Erring, then is the <hi>private Judgment of diſcretion of moſt private Men in the world;</hi> eſpecially when they go point-blank againſt a whole Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council in points of higher Concernment then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40740:44"/> was this point, in which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was preſently ready to ſubmit his Judgment. If then we will not be guilty of ſo intolerable a pride in overvaluing our own private Judgment of Diſcretion, with ſo manifeſt hazard of miſſing that without which we cannot pleaſe God, or be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ed, then will it highly concern us to enquire care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſes that <hi>Holy way, which will be unto us a direct way, ſo that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> For ſuch a way our God hath promiſed us: Let us ſearch carefully after it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> This Promiſe of God had not been performed, and Chriſt at his coming had but pittifully provided for his Church, if he had not left it ſome certain Judge, whoſe Judgment All men ſhould be interiourly (for faith is in the Interiour) bound to follow in all their differences and Controverſies; inſomuch that it muſt be one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degrees of Treaſon againſt God, not to ſubmit his Judgment to the Judgment of him, whom God ſhould appoint for the Judge of all Matters of faith. For if there be no ſuch ſevere Obligation to ſubmit to the Judgment of this Judge, then might every Man chuſe, whether he would in his Interiour Judgment ſubmit to this Judge or No. And ſo that very Abſurdity and very Perdition of Souls would follow, which is in the having no Judge at all; to wit, that every Man might believe in his <hi>Interiour Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (in which onely faith conſiſts) what ſhould ſeem to him to be grounded in Scripture; And ſo as <hi>the private Judgment of diſcretion in one Man is directly Oppoſite and Contrary to another Mans private Judgment of diſcretion,</hi> the faith of the One would be directly contrary to the faith of the Other: And yet there is but one faith True, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which One true faith it is Impoſſible to pleaſe God, and conſequently to be ſaved. How then ſhould God have provided ſufficiently for Mens Salvation, if after their moſt Careful reading and Conferring the Scriptures, No One Man among thoſe Thouſand Men, who even then differ in Religion, No One Man, I ſay, but that One Man
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40740:44"/> who holdeth the Truth (which is but One) ſhould Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly follow that faith, without which it is Impoſſible to be ſaved? It muſt needs then be a moſt damnable Sin to commit that higheſt treaſon againſt Gods Judge, which is committed by not ſubmitting our Interior Judgment unto him; being that in this our proceeding we go a way, in which all unity in Interiour faith (which is in the firſt place to be regarded) is wholly Impoſſible to be kept.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſee (as a thing which concerneth us both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> moſt neerly) who is Guilty of this high Treaſon, I, who am a Roman Catholick, or You, who are not: for our faith being Contrary in Prime points, one of us muſt needs go aſtray from that One faith, without which it is Impoſſible to pleaſe God. And he of us Two who thus ſtrayeth, therefore ſtrayeth (and by doing ſo, teacheth others to ſtray) becauſe he doth not ſubmit his Judgment to the Judgment of this Judge: for if we both did this, we ſhould joyn in all poſſible unity of this One true faith.</p>
            <p>And here comes in that moſt Important queſtion, Who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is this Judge, to whom All are thus to ſubmit their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all Controverſies of faith? For if we can find out this Judge, we can never remain in any doubt; for without all doubt, we muſt ſtand to the Judgment of this Judge, what reaſons ſoever our private Judgment of Diſcretion may ſuggeſt; or elſe we had as good have no Judge at all, and it is not our Own private Judgment of diſcretion, but the Publick Judgment of that Judge whom Chriſt hath appointed us, and which we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to follow, as hath been ſhewn.</p>
            <p>All Proteſtants do ſay, that the Scripture, and onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the Scripture is left us by Chriſt for our Judge, to end and determine with Infallible Authority all our doubts, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and Controverſies in Religion. And in this their Tenent they agree with all Hereticks which have riſen up againſt the Church of Chriſt. We Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks do profeſs, that all reverence and all Credit is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40740:45"/> due unto the Scriptures, as unto the Infallible word of God, inſomuch, that we are ready to give our lives in defence of any thing which is affirmed in Scripture. I add that we and only we do truly believe the Scriptures; for he only truly believeth any thing with divine faith, who groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Aſſent upon divine Revelation: But the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſent of Roman Catholicks only with which they believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be Gods undoubted word) is grounded on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, manifeſted to them by his Church, which (as I will ſhew) is Infallible. The Aſſent, by which others believe the Scriptures to be Gods undoubted word, is not grounded on this Revelation manifeſted by his Church, as they all confeſs, neither is it grounded upon any other divine Revelation, as I will now prove. For if there be any ſuch Revelation manifeſted to them, it is manifeſted to them in the Scriptures, as they ſay: But there is no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation manifeſted to them in the Scriptures; for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten no where in the Scriptures, that ſuch and ſuch books of Scripture be Canonical, and the undoubted word of God; therefore this cannot be believed for any Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made manifeſt to us in Scripture. They believe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this without any revelation made by God, and ſo their Belief is not Divine, but a humane belief, juſt ſuch an one as we have, that ſuch and ſuch a book is <hi>Virgil</hi>'s, ſuch a book is <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, &amp;c. And if they tell me, that they by reading Canonical Scriptures, do ſee a light clearly manifeſting them to be Gods word, I anſwer, that the ſight by this light is no certain divine revelation, but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perſwaſion ſubject to falſity, and that far more then the light, by which whole General Councels have ſeen the quite Contrary, as I clearly will prove, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. A ſecond convincing Argument to prove, that onely we truely believe the Scriptures, is, that all others who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not Hebrew and Greek in which the Scriptures were written, cannot know by any divine faith the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God, but they all take upon truſt of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40740:45"/> Men fallible the Tranſlations, which they call Gods word, which Tranſlations are full of many and groſs corruptions, as concerning our Engliſh Bible in particular many have ſhewed. Now then there is not one amongſt ten thouſand, who perfectly underſtand Greek and Hebrew; Therefore all the reſt have onely a humane perſwaſion, that their Scriptures be Gods uncorrupted word. For I am ſure it is no where revealed, that theſe Tranſlations be Gods uncorrupted word. The Roman Catholick hath ſtill the Authority of a Church Infallible, to aſſure him which is, which is not Gods uncorrupted word. This Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I will prove to be Divine and warranted by God. But yet we hold it Impoſſible, that the book of the Scripture ſhould be the Judge appointed by Chriſt to end all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, or that it ſhould be that <hi>Holy way, that ſhall be unto us a direct way, that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> For we ſee with our eyes whole Thouſands of Men very wiſe and Learned, whilſt they follow the Scriptures with all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (as they moſt ſolemnly proteſt from their heart) to follow a world of quite contrary ways in matter of higheſt Importance to Salvation, and conſequently all theſe Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of wiſe men, but thoſe who go one only of theſe wayes, muſt needs go aſtray. Now if wiſe Men in ſo great Multitudes do ſo ſtrangely ſtray, whilſt in all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (as they proteſt) they follow this way, how is it true, that <hi>fools cannot erre by it?</hi> Doth not St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and all the greateſt Doctors that ever the Church had, profeſs themſelves unable to underſtand the Scriptures, and this after many years ſtudy in them? and how then can men of ſuch ordinary Capacities, and of ſo mean ſtudy and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of thoſe tongues in which the Scriptures were written, and ſo great variety of Opinions about the true Canon of Scriptures, and a far greater variety about the true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of ſo many moſt Important places of the true Canon of Scripture, come to know the truth, the Infallible and undoubted truth, and this ſo aſſuredly, that they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40740:46"/> may with a ſafe Conſcience upon their private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion ſettle their faith unmoveably in points which they know to be ſo mightily called into doubt by the greater Part of the world, yea that whole General Councels have unanimouſly defined the Contrary, and believed thoſe places of Scripture not to ſay that to be ſo, which, for thoſe places of Scripture, they ſtill ſay and firmly believe to be ſo? Is not ſuch a belief mainly to be ſuſpected, even in the wiſeſt and learnedſt Men? And will you then ſay ſtill, that this is <hi>A direct way unto us, ſo that fools cannot erre by it?</hi> The contrary will yet appear far more clearly, when you ſhall have pondered the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons: yet take this for one ſtrong reaſon, why the Scriptures cannot be that Judge of Controverſies who is to direct us, by a <hi>way ſo direct unto us, that fools, cannot erre by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The ſecond Reaſon, to prove the Scriptures not to be this Judge, is this. There be many Controverſies, and may be yet very many more, moſt nearly concerning the neceſſary Means to Salvation, which can never be ended, and undoubtedly decided by the Judgment and ſentence to the Scriptures. I will alledge ſeveral convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Examples. For a Controverſie may be moved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the lawfulneſs of working, or not working upon <hi>Saturdayes</hi> and <hi>Sundayes.</hi> How will this Controverſie be decided by the Scriptures? All the old Scriptures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſtrictly the not working upon <hi>Saturdayes,</hi> and no One ſingle word of the New Scripture doth aſſure us, that this Command was ever by Lawful Authority taken away; or that there is the leaſt unlawfulneſs in working upon the <hi>Sunday.</hi> We know indeed, that there was ſuch a day as the Lords day, called by that name, becauſe Saint <hi>John</hi> had a viſion upon that day, as he had alſo upon many other dayes. We know St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached upon the firſt day of the week, and ſo he did upon many other dayes, and moſt upon the Saturday or Sabboth; For
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40740:46"/> 
               <hi>He diſputed in the Synagogue every Sabboth, and the exhorted the Jews and the Greeks. (Act.</hi> 18.) We know the firſt day of the week was at one time appointed for the gathering of Almes for poor Chriſtians: But how doth this or any of the former Places prove the Commandement of not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the Saturday to be taken quite away, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly? Or how do any of theſe places impoſe upon All Chriſtians, a manifeſt and unqueſtionable Obligation of not working on Sundays? And yet this is All that can be ſaid out of the Scriptures for the undoubted aboliſhing of a certain Commandement of God, and the undoubted bringing into the place of it a New Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, without perhaps the Riſing onely of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our on the Sunday be ſufficient to prove both theſe things undoubtedly. Yet how can this be? For the day of his Aſcenſion into Heaven was the final period of all he did in the world, and that day was Thurſday. The Reſurrection indeed might be a Ground for ſuch a Change, but it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in Scripture that ſuch a Change was made on that Ground. Yea if we ſtand even to the New Scriptures, our Adverſaries the Jews will be too hard for us. For they will tell us, that according to our Scriptures, when our Saviour was asked (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.) <hi>What good ſhall I do, that I may have life Everlaſting?</hi> our Saviour ſaid, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandements.</hi> And when that Man replyed, to know what Commandement he did underſtand, he clearly told him, that he underſtood the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Decalogue, <hi>Thoſe very Commandements which that Man knew well</hi> enough, (as it is ſaid clearly alſo in St. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.) You ſee here (will a Jew, or ſome new Sectary ſay unto us) that even in our new Law, our own Law-maker with his own mouth commandeth, as a thing neceſſary to enter into life Everlaſting, the keeping of the Commandements of the Decalogue, which that Man did know. Therefore he in the New Law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Commandement of keeping the Saturday to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40740:47"/> obſerved, as well as the reſt. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19.) <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and Prepuce is nothing, but the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Commandements of God.</hi> See here St. <hi>Paul,</hi> even after Circumciſion was declared nothing, to declare the Commandements of God to ſtand in force; and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe Commandements, a chief one is, the keeping of the Saturday, or ſeventh day, on which God reſted: which reaſon alſo holdeth ſtill, for ſtill it is true, that God reſted on the ſeventh Day, and <hi>he bleſſed the ſeventh Day, and ſanctified it,</hi> for the foreſaid Reaſon. How came this Sanctification and Bleſſing to be loſt, the reaſon of it being ſtill as good as ever? And why then (will this Jew or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctariſt ſay) ſhould we prefer the keeping of any other day before this, which hath ſo good a Reaſon, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a better, at leaſt undoubtedly better, and which hath ſo manifeſt Authority of the Old and of the New Scriptures, even Three of the four Evangeliſts, and alſo in St. <hi>Paul;</hi> whereas for the taking away of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, or for the not working on the Sunday, there is not one ſingle Place in all the Bible, much leſſe ſuch a place as manifeſtly convinceth? This Argument is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable to thoſe who make the Scriptures the ſole Judge of Controverſies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Again, theſe Jews and new Sectaries will preſſe us, that our own Scriptures (which we hold onely to be our Judge in all Controverſies) do cleerly tell us, that even in the New Law it is ſaid (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.) <hi>It hath ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and us</hi> (Apoſtles of the New Law) <hi>to lay no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burthen upon you, then theſe neceſſary things, that you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from the things immolated to Idols, and blood, and that which is ſtrangled.</hi> See here, among Neceſſary things, one is, to abſtain from blood (which Chriſtians do not, nor think not to be done; for they freely eat black Puddings) and alſo to abſtain from things ſtrangled, as when we ſtrangle Chickens and eat them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If you tell me, that Scripture onely is Iudge of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40740:47"/> Controverſies, I will tell you that by the Iudgement of this Iudge (following no other as infallible) woe be to the Opinion of all Catholiques and Proteſtants, who hold it lawful to work upon Saturdayes, unlawful on Sundayes; lawful to eat Blood and Strangled things, unlawful to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from them, as ſtill forbidden: woe I ſay to our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it not onely will not be judged as undoubtedly true by Scripture, but alſo it will, and that undoubtedly, be judged falſe by the Places now cited. I pray tell me here, how Men of mean capacity, yea how Men of the greateſt capacity in the World, ſhall be able to finde by the judgement of Scripture onely, what is Infallibly to be believed in theſe points, in which ſo many hundred Thouſands of Jewes damnably differ from us.</p>
            <p>Did not all this Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> grounded upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Scriptures, clear enough (as they ſaid) both hold and ſwear, that they held the King, the Head of the Church? can any point in the Church be of higher concernment to the Church, then to know for certain their own Head? And yet this point is now no longer aſcertained us by the Infallible judgement of Scripture.</p>
            <p>For another example, what Controverſie can more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> then to be undoubtedly, and by Infallible Authority ſecured, which books of Scripture be Canonical, and the certain Word of God, and which be not? You ſay there is no Infallibility of any verity to be had but by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. But I ſay, that in all the Scripture no Infallibility can be had concerning the Canon of the Scripture: wherefore either we cannot know this moſt important point of all points infallibly, or elſe we muſt acknowledge the Church to be Infallible: for the Scripture in this point is wholly ſilent. We diſpute and differ highly about the books of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> whether they be the certain Word of God or no. I pray tell me, how ſhall this grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie be decided, and decided Infallibly by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> We all believe the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> not onely to be the true Goſpel of Chriſt and his Word, but alſo to be the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as alſo the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> to be written by St. <hi>Mark.</hi> If any Man ſhould deny this, what place of Scripture could we cite againſt him? or what Infallible ground have we of this our belief? The <hi>Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſts,</hi> the <hi>Cerdoniſts,</hi> the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> do abſolutely deny St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel to be Gods Word. This Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, you ſay, and all other Controverſies of Faith, is to be ended by the Scripture: I ask what place of Scripture will end this Controverſie, and all other Controverſies about all other books of Scripture, which have almoſt all been denyed to be Gods Word, by ſome Hereticks or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as for St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> you muſt know that all Ancient Writers, no one excepted, do ſay, that he did write in Hebrew; and yet neither his Hebrew Goſpel, nor any one certain Copy of it is extant in the World. Tell me then, upon what undoubted Ground you beleeve any thing that is in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel onely. The Greek Tranſlation which we have, was made by God knows whom: for we know not. He might be a faithful or unfaithful Tranſlator, he might uſe a falſe uncorrect Copy, he might miſtake in many places by Ignorance, in many by Negligence or Malice. Upon what Infallible ground ſhall a converted <hi>Manichaean</hi> (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) believe this Greek Goſpel which we have? By what Scripture will you preſſe him to it? yea, upon what Scripture do you your ſelves beleeve this Goſpel (this Greek Tranſlation of S. <hi>Matthew?</hi>) If you tell me Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> did write in Greek, I muſt tell you, that all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity (no one antient Author excepted) ſay the contrary. How will you then ground Infallible belief, upon your ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40740:48"/> new and ſo uncertain Opinion? When this queſtion was moved, whether any Book was to be received as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Word of God or no, The Holy Fathers could never finde any more undoubted ground, then that the Church did allow or not allow of ſuch Books to be held for Gods undoubted Word. Upon this ground St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius (in fine Synopſis)</hi> receiveth the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and the other Three Goſpels, and rejected the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> Upon this Ground <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and St. <hi>Leo,</hi> profeſſe themſelves to admit ſuch, and to deny other Books to be Canonical. Upon this ground it is, that <hi>Euſebius (Hiſt.

            <p>By this the Author of the Reply may ſee how Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> his Anſwer (<hi>pag.</hi> 25.) is, when he ſaith, <hi>Indeed we take the Canonical Books by Tradition from the Church, but we do not take them to be Canonical upon her Tradition; but aſſent is ſetled in them as Canonical, in the way of Faith, becauſe they are ſuch: In thy light we ſhall ſee light; ſo by Scripture we ſhall ſee Scripture.</hi> So he, but not ſo any one of the Fathers, who were moſt often preſſed to give a reaſon why they believed ſuch Books to be Canonical, why not. None of theſe profeſſed themſelves to be ſo ſharp ſighted, that by ſeeing onely Canonical Scriptures, they could ſee them
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40740:49"/> to be Canonical Scriptures, and that ſo manifeſtly, as to ground their Faith upon it. You by the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> ſee it to be Canonical; your moſt illuminated <hi>Luther</hi> could not ſee it to be ſo by that light. By all the light he had, he Judged St. <hi>James</hi> his Epiſtle to be made of Straw, yet you ſee in it a light, ſhewing undoubtedly it to be Gods Word. You cannot ſee the two firſt Books of <hi>Macchabees</hi> to be Canonical, yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> believed them to be ſo, for that the Councel of <hi>Carthage (Can.</hi> 47.) received them for ſuch; as alſo the books of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> of which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it was received of all Chriſtian Biſhops, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even to the laſt of the Laity, with veneration of Divine Authority (l. de Praedeſt. Sanct. Sanctorum</hi> 14.) What more cleer? And yet you ſee, that all you of the Church of <hi>England, deny all veneration of Divine Authority to this Book.</hi> By what Scripture ſhall we end this and the like Controverſies of other Books, for which we have as ſtrong proofs as theſe now cited; and you have onely ſo weak a proof, as is a light ſo peculiar to your ſelves. And upon the certainty given you, onely by this ſight, you firmely believe all the Scripture that you believe, that is; all the Faith you have, all the Beliefe you have depends upon this; <hi>That you can ſee ſo evidently ſuch and ſuch a Book to be Canonical, that this your Sight, by light received from thoſe Book, ſhewing them to be aſſuredly Canonical, is the onely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Aſſurance you have, that ſuch and ſuch Books are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical;</hi> and conſequently, this your peculiar ſight is the onely Infallible Ground you have to rely upon theſe books, as upon the undoubted Word of God. This is your Doctrine, this is your <hi>Holy Way, a way ſo direct, that fools cannot erre by it,</hi> though you profeſſe ſo many wiſe Men in this point have erred, even whole General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, as alſo ſo many great Doctors, before whoſe eyes this ſame light ſtood as clear as before yours: for they Judged very many to be Canonical Scriptures which you deny; ſo weak a ground are you all forced to rely upon, even in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40740:49"/> the main Point of Eternal Salvation, whileſt you refuſe to rely on the Infallible Authority of Chriſts Church. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this our relying on the Churches Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to the Scriptures: for we do not ſay, that the Church maketh them true Scriptures, but it maketh us to have an Infallible Ground to hold them for true Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as they are in themſelves, and this, not becauſe the Church maketh them held to be ſo, but becauſe they are true in themſelves, as being the Word of God; yet not known by themſelves to be ſo by any Infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without this the teſtimony of the Church; as Chriſt was the Lamb of God who taketh away the ſins of the World, but the Infallible teſtimony of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> made many know, that he was ſo. And thus Chriſt was made known to the world by the Infallible teſtimony of his Apoſtles; upon whoſe teſtimony many Thouſands believed before the Scriptures were written. Therefore for the Scriptures to be believed what they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the Infallible Teſtimony of the Church, doth no more derogate to their honour, or make the Church Superiour to them, then it derogateth to the honour of the Son of God to be believed to be what he is, upon the Infallible teſtimony of his Apoſtles; which teſtimony had it not been Infallible, thoſe who grounded their Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it had had no Infallible ground to believe our Saviour to be him, who he is. In like manner, if the Authority of the Church, teſtifying ſuch and ſuch books to be Gods Word, were not Infallible, we ſhould have no Infallible ground to know them to be ſuch, though they truly be ſuch of themſelves: but of this Infallibility I will ſay no more.</p>
            <p>Now I will go on, and ſhew yet further, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> cannot be the Judges of all Controverſies: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are ſet down in Scripture in ſuch manner, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Controverſies which are in the Church, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe about the true Interpretation of the Scripture. And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40740:50"/> God did well know that this would happen, and therefore he muſt needs know that he ſhould give the world a very unprofitable Judge, in order to the keeping of Unity, and deciding of Controverſies, if he ſhould onely leave them a Book, about the true meaning of which Book he well knew more Controverſies and Diſunions in Religion would ariſe, then about any other matter; ſo that the greateſt Wits here, being at greateſt diſſention, this cannot be <hi>That holy way, a way ſo direct to us, that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> No Law-maker of any Common-wealth did ever provide ſo ſimply for the Unity of it, as to leave them onely a Book of Lawes to be the ſole Judge of all their Controverſies, as I ſhewed before. And ſurely if Chriſt had intended to leave us a Book to be our ſole Judge in all Controverſies, then undoubtedly he would in ſome part of this Book have clearly told us ſo, this importing ſo exceedingly as it doth, and yet he hath not done ſo. Secondly, if he would have given us a Book for Judge he would never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us for our Judge, ſuch a Book as the Scripture is, which very often ſpeaketh, ſometimes ſo Prophetically, that moſt would think it ſpoke of the preſent time, when it ſpeaketh of the time to come; that it ſpoke of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for example, of <hi>David,</hi> when it ſpeaketh of Chriſt; ſometime it ſpeaketh by a Figure, by a Metaphor, by a Parable, it hath Tropological, Allegorical, Anagogical, and Myſtical ſenſes. It uſeth the Imperative Mood, as well for Councels as Commands. In no place it ſo much goeth about to ſet down a Catalogue of any particular points neceſſary, and onely neceſſary to be believed, which any wiſe Law-maker would do, if he intended by his writings to end all Controverſies in Faith: yea, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſeemeth often to ſay evidently that, which according to your Doctrine is falſe. You hold for Superſtitious, the Annoynting of ſick Perſons, with certain Prayers, and yet Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith (cap. 5. ver. 14.) <hi>Is any ſick among you? let him call for the Prieſts of the Church, and let them pray over
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40740:50"/> him, annoynting him with Oyl, and if he have committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Is not this Controverſie clearly by this place of Scripture decided againſt you? or, have you any one place half ſo clear to the contrary? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, about thoſe other moſt clear words ſpoken in the Inſtitution of another great Sacrament, in which any wiſe Man would ſpeak clearly, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> the late Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Roman Church have found out above two hundred ſeveral Interpretations. They will needs have the ſenſe to be figurative, although never any Man in any figurative ſpeech was heard to ſpeak thus: For example, to take a Vine, a Lamb, a Door in his hand, and ſay, this Vine, this Lamb, this Door is Chriſt; This is no kinde of figurative ſpeech, though it be a clear figure to ſay, <hi>Chriſt is a Vine, a Lamb, a Door,</hi> yea he is Bread: But to take Bread into a Mans hand, as Chriſt did, and then ſay, <hi>This Bread is my Body;</hi> to take a Cup of Wine into his hand, and to ſay, <hi>This is the Cup of my Blood, which ſhall be ſhed for you,</hi> doth not ſo much as ſound like a figurative ſpeech; and yet our Adverſaries think it ſo certainly to be ſo, that they venture their Souls upon that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived certainty. Thus you ſee, when the Scripture in four ſeveral places delivereth theſe four words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> Men will hold it to be clear, that ſo clear words be not clear, and will venture their Salvation upon this their Imagination. In this and many other points, we ſay, the Scripture is clear for us: The <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay, it is clear for them: The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> ſay, it is clear for them. We have conferred Place with Place, we have looked in the Originals; and after all this, the Scripture doth not decide this Controverſie; but when all is done, we are as far from Agreeing, and being brought to the undoubted knowledge of the moſt important truth, as we were at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Another very ſtrong Argument, to declare that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Scripture cannot be the Judge of all Controverſies in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40740:51"/> points of Faith neceſſary to Salvation, is this; That there be many points, the believing of which is neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which points are no where ſet down clearly in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For firſt, you make it the chief point of all points, to believe the Scripture to be the Judge of all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and by it ſelf ſufficient to end them all. I ask, where is this point of points which you make the ground of your belief? where is it, I ſay, ſet down in Scriptures, and that ſo clearly, that no prudent doubt can be made, but that ſuch words clearly ſay what you ſay? Doth not Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Creed put down as an undoubted Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Catholick Faith, <hi>(which Faith</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Man hold it entirely and inviolably, without all doubt he ſhall periſh eternally)</hi> doth he not put down there, that we muſt believe; That God the Father is not begotten, that God the Son is not made, but begotten by his Father only; that the holy Ghoſt is neither made, nor begotten, but doth proceed, and that both from the Father and the Son; <hi>And that he, who will be ſaved, muſt believe thus?</hi> And yet how far are theſe moſt hard points from being clearly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in the Scripture: So alſo, that God the Son is Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial to his Father, and of the ſame Subſtance, is a certain Article of Faith, and yet no where clearly delivered in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but was believed by All upon the ſole Authority of the Church, which conſequently was believed Infallible.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> I have already ſhewed, that the neceſſary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment of keeping the Sunday in place of the Saturday is no where in Scripture, but rather the contrary. How then can I believe this for the Scripture, or for any clear place of it, there being no ſuch place to be found? I have alſo ſhewed, that it is no where in Scripture ſet down at all (much leſſe ſet down clearly and manifeſtly) which Books of Scripture be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, which not. How then by the Teſtimony of Scripture which giveth no Teſtimony at all of this point, can I believe ſuch books undoubtedly to be, ſuch not to be Canonical? Baptiſme of Children to be Neceſſary to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40740:51"/> their ſalvation is a prime point of Belief, and yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe this prime point upon any clear place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (for there is no ſuch place) but you muſt all ſay with the great Saint <hi>Auſtin, That though nothing for certain can be alledged out of Canonical Scriptures in this point, yet in this point, the truth of Scriptures,</hi> (and conſequently a ſufficient ground for Faith) <hi>is kept by us, when we do that which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to the Catholick Church, which Church the Authority of the ſame Scriptures doth commend. (Contra Creſcon. l</hi> 1.13.) And this following the Tradition of the Church, he calleth <hi>The moſt true and inviolable Rule of Truth.</hi> He holdeth therefore Tradition of the Church ſo Infallible, that it may be a ground for Faith. He was taught ſo by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 Theſ. 2.) <hi>Hold the Traditions which you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either by word of Mouth, or by Epiſtle.</hi> Upon which place, Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> having taught that the Apoſtles delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many things by word of Mouth, not ſet down any where in writing; he ſaith, <hi>that theſe</hi> (unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>are worthy of the ſame belief which thoſe deſerve which are written: It is a Tradition</hi> (of the Catholick Church) <hi>Seek no further.</hi> So he. But you ſay, I muſt ſeek further to find this in Scripture, yet Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> tells me, that being a Tradition of the Church, it is Gods Word, and upon this account as worthy to be believed as if it were his written Word: for it is the being his Word, and not the being of his written Word, which maketh it Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true.</p>
            <p>Well then, It having been made clear by all theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> and authorities, that the Scriptures cannot be intended by Chriſt for the Judge of all our Controverſies in Faith, and that their reading cannot be that <hi>Holy way, a way ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect unto us, that fools cannot erre by it;</hi> Let us ſee where this way is to be found, and who is to be judge to define all Controverſies with Infallible authority, ſo that all are bound to ſubmit their Interiour judgement (in which all faith conſiſts) to this Authority, it being high Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40740:52"/> Chriſt, not to ſubmit to an Authority inſtituted by him purpoſely to oblige all to this ſubmiſſion. I ſay this Judge is the Catholique Church. This I will prove firſt, and this being proved, I will ſhew briefly that no Church but the <hi>Roman</hi> can prudently be held to be this Catholique Church. In proof of the Catholique Church her being Judge of all Controverſies; I alledge firſt thoſe words, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>I ſay unto thee,</hi> (that is to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by name) <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, (that is, Thou art a Rock;) <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> that is, thoſe Gates of Hell out of which ſo many damnable Errours ſhall iſſue, ſhall never prevail by inducing any damnable Error into that Church, which I will build upon thee, O <hi>Peter,</hi> and thy Succeſſours; which I add, becauſe this Church was not to be built upon the Perſon of St. <hi>Peter</hi> onely; for then this fair building had fallen to the ground when St. <hi>Peter</hi> had died. They who do ſay, that the Church may fall into damnable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, do ſay, that the Church may fall to the ground, and that the Gates of Hell may prevail againſt it: for what greater fall can it have, then by damnable Errors to make its Members all fall into Hell? and in what manner can the Gates of Hell more prevail againſt it? And yet we are ſure by Gods Word, that ſhall never happen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Church we imbrace moſt groundedly all things propoſed by it to be believed. Here you ſee our Judge, Chriſts Church, hath Gods warrant to warrant Her from bringing in any damnable Error by her Judgement: All may therefore ſecurely obey, But that none can ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſobey her Judgement; Chriſt alſo doth warrant us, in the next Chapter but one: (for <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 17.) he ſaith, <hi>Tell the Church, and if he will not hear the Church, Let him be unto thee as a Heathen and Publican.</hi> Here you ſee all Cauſes of greater Importance are to be brought to this Judge: for if even private complaints are to be brought into her Tribunal, and if for diſobedience after her Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40740:52"/> given of them, a man be to be hold for a Publican or Heathen, much more are enormiouſly hurtful crimes, ſuch as are the crimes of Hereſie, to be carried to her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and thoſe, who in ſo much more Importing matters diſobey, are alſo much more to be held for Publicans and Heathens. And that no man may think, that after this his condemnation he may ſtand well in his <hi>Interiour,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting ſtill in the ſame judgement, and doing ſo, ſtand right in the ſight of God, it followeth, <hi>Amen I ſay unto you</hi> (Prelates of my Church) <hi>VVhatſoever ye ſhall bind upon Earth, ſhall alſo be bound in Heaven.</hi> You ſee I have found a Judge ſo ſecurely to be followed in his Judgement, and ſo unſafely to be diſobeyed, that his Sentence given upon Earth, is ſure to be ratified in Heaven. This alſo could not be true, if this Judge were fallible in ſuch prime cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as moſt concern the Church, and all ſuch cauſes are thoſe which may bring in damnable Errors.</p>
            <p>Conformably to this doctrine of the Church, her being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> our Judge, Saint <hi>Auſtin (de Civit. l.</hi> 20.9.) expounds to our purpoſe thoſe words of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> (cap. 20. ver. 4.) <hi>I ſaw Seats, and they ſate upon them, and Judgement was given them. It is not to be expounded of the laſt Judgement, but of the Seats of Prelates, and the Prelates themſelves, by which the Church is now governed, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</hi> All this which I have ſaid out of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, you will the leſſe wonder at, if you Note, that even in the Old Law it is ſaid, <hi>The lips of the Prieſt ſhall keep knowledge, and they ſhall require the Law from his Mouth, becauſe he is the Angel of the Lord God of Hoſts, (Mal</hi> 2.) Note here a groſſe corruption of the Engliſh Bible, which readeth theſe words, <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth,</hi> whereas the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals ſpeak clearly in the future Tenſe. Here by the way, I muſt tell you, that, though the Scripture were to be Judge, yet your moſt corruptd <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scriptures cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for Judge. Whence it followeth, that thoſe who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40740:53"/> do underſtand onely <hi>Engliſh,</hi> can judge of nothing by their Scripture: And ſo they muſt truſt their Miniſters to the full as much, even in this higheſt point, as we do our Prieſts in any point.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> But let us proceed; You ſee firſt, that I have found <hi>a way ſo direct, that fools cannot erre by it:</hi> for any man may ask the Prieſts of the Church, what is the known Doctrine of the Church, and then let him reſt ſecurely, when he knoweth that. Secondly, you ſee I have found ſuch a Judge, as all true believers had for all their Controverſies for more then two thouſand years together, before <hi>Moſes</hi> did write the firſt Books of Scripture; all which time you muſt needs make the Tradition of the Church the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule of Faith: for here was no written Word of God, upon which their Faith could be built, and yet Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.) ſpeaking of thoſe who lived in thoſe Ages before all Scripture, ſaith, <hi>They had the ſame Spirit of Faith.</hi> And the reaſon is clear: for the Word of God is the ſame, whether it be revealed by the Pen, or by the Tongue, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or not written. <hi>And what</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Irenaus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) <hi>if the Apoſtles had not left us the Scriptures? Muſt we not have followed that order of Tradition, which they delivered to thoſe, to whoſe Charges they left the Churches to be governed? To this order</hi> (of Tradition by the unwritten word) <hi>many of thoſe barbarous Nations do aſſent, who have believed in Chriſt, without any writing or Inke, having Salvation written in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, and keeping diligently the ancient Traditions.</hi> So St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who you ſee holdeth manifeſtly unwritten Traditions of the Church to be a ſufficient Ground of Faith. It is moſt manifeſtly true, which he ſaith, that upon this ground the Faith of whole Nations have relyed. This ground therefore is infallible, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Faith relying on this, even two Thouſand years and more before the firſt Scriptures were written, and the Faith of many other Nations, who ſince their writing have believed, and do believe the true Faith. For how many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40740:53"/> of them never did ſee the Scriptures at all, or never did ſee them in a Language, which they could underſtand? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Apoſtles, or their Succeſſors take any care to have the Scripture communicated to all Nations in ſuch languages, as they could all, or the greater part underſtand. They thought the Tradition of the Church a ſufficient Rule of Faith for all, which they could not do, if this Rule were fallible: We muſt therefore confeſſe it to be Infallible.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have not onely found a Judge, ſo clearly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> pointing out the way, that fools cannot erre by it, but ſuch a Judge as no exception can be taken againſt his ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: for no other Judge was in the Church for ſome Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years amongſt the moſt true Beleevers, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards amongſt whole Nations. Fourthly, I have found a Judge, to whom Chriſt hath given a certain Promiſe, to teach no damnable error, by which Doctrine the Gates of Hell ſhould prevail againſt her. Fiftly, I have found a Judge, whom All men are obliged (I ſay obliged by Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Aſſent in point of Faith) to obey, under pain of being held here for Heathens or Publicans, and looked upon as ſuch by the Judgement of Heaven, binding what the Church bindeth. Sixtly, I have found a living Judge, who can be informed of all Controverſies ariſing from time to time, and who can hear Me and You, and be heard by Me and You: that neither I nor You can doubt of the true meaning of this Church, or if we doubt, we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our doubt, and ſhe will tell us clearly her meaning; whereas the Bible can neither hear a Thouſand new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which ariſe daily, nor be heard clearly to give any certain Sentence in them, but onely ſay the ſame ſtill which ſhe ſaid even before the Controverſies began, and about which Sentence of hers, all the Controverſie did ariſe; neither doth the Bible give any ſuch Judgement, as will ſuffice to hold theſe and theſe men, who teach theſe and theſe errors, for Heathens and Publicans, which the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40740:54"/> Church doth ſo clearly and ſo manifeſtly, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot deny themſelves to be condemned by the Church, together with their Doctrine; but all they can do, is, to raile againſt their Judge, which the damned ſhall do againſt Chriſt their Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> I ſee no exception there can be made againſt this Judge: Onely you will tell me, that Infallibility is wholly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Judge of Faith, which I alſo confeſſe; yet I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſay, that this Church of Chriſt, muſt be confeſſed to be Infallible. But withall, I would have every one know, that the Roman Church doth oblige to no more, then to believe that the Pope defining with a lawful General Councel, cannot erre; for it is no neceſſary Article of Faith, to believe that the Pope or head of the Church cannot erre, when he defineth without a General Councel. Now that this definition of a whole General Councel is Infallible, ought not to ſeem ſtrange to any Chriſtian: for who can think it ſtrange, that Chriſt, for the ſecure dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the firſt Chriſtians whom the Apoſtles converted, ſhould give this Infallibility to all and every one of the Apoſtles, and that he ſhould regard ſo little the ſecure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of all other Chriſtians, who were to be from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, to the end of the world, that for their ſakes, &amp; for the ſecure direction of their Souls, he would not give this Infallibility ſo much as to one Man, no not to all the Prelats of Chriſtianity aſſembled together with their head, to define matters moſt neceſſary, and in which all error would be moſt pernicious; who I ſay, could think this ſtrange? eſpecially, being this gift of Infallibility is given, not for their private ſakes to whom it is given, but for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good, and neceſſary direction, concord, and perpetual unity of the whole Church? You muſt acknowledge that he gave Infallibility of Doctrine to all thoſe, who did write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall part of the Old or New Scripture. He gave it to <hi>David,</hi> though he was an Adulterer: he gave it to <hi>Solomon,</hi> who proved not only a moſt vicious Man in Life, but who for his own perſon in point of Faith, came to fall into Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40740:54"/> of Idols. This you will not have thought ſtrange, but you will hold it Incredible, that he ſhould give this Infallibility, not to one Man, but the whole Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in a General Councel.</p>
            <p>Let us paſſe on further yet, and ſee how firmly this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Infallibility is grounded. I have above ſhewed how ſtrongly it is grounded on thoſe words of God, promiſing a <hi>Holy way, a way ſo direct unto us, that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> See here the third Number. In the eight Number I have ſhewed, that we cannot ground that Faith, by which we believe the Sabbath to be changed to the Sunday, upon Scripture; but we muſt ground it upon the Tradition of the Church, which if it be not Infallible, we have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Ground at all for this point. And in the ninth Number, I have ſhewed the ſelf-ſame to be about eating Blood, or Chickens, or any thing that is ſtrangled. In the 11, 12, and 13. Number, I have demonſtrated, that by the Scripture we cannot know which is true Scripture, which is falſe; which Books be Infallibly the Word of God, which not; for the Scripture hath not one Text in which it telleth us this: and therefore for this Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point of Faith, we can finde no other ſure Ground, then the Tradition of an Infallible Church: for a fallible Tradition may deceive us. In the 14. Number I have ſhewed, that when Controverſies ariſe (as moſt, and moſt Important Controverſies do ariſe) about the true meaning of the Scripture, even after we have conferred all places together, and looked upon the Original Languages, the the Controverſies ſtill remain undecided, and no Infallible way can be found to decide them by Scripture. There is therefore no Infallible way to decide them; if the deciſion and definition of the whole Church in a General Councel be not Infallible. This is ſo clear, that (to the wonder of the world) <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, in his Book of the Power of the Pope, writeth thus. <hi>We are not certain, of any private Man, that he hath the Revelation of the Father. The Church alone it is, of which it is not lawful to doubt.</hi> So he. In the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40740:55"/> 15. Number I have ſhewed, that there be many points neceſſarily to be believed under pain of damnation, which points are not at all ſet down in any clear Scripture. For theſe points it is manifeſt, that we can have no other ground then the Authority of the Church. If this be not Infallible, then we have onely fallible ground, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ground of Faith. In the 16. Number I have confirmed the ſame Doctrine by the Authority of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> and Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> In the 17. Number I have proved this Doctrine clearly out of Gods Promiſe, that <hi>he would build this his Church upon a Rock, and that the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt it,</hi> which the Gates of Hell might eaſily do, if the Church could come to teach dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errors, carrying her and her Children into the Gates of Hell it ſelf. The ſame in the ſame place I have proved by Gods commanding us to <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us to hold all thoſe who will not hear the Church, as Publicans and Heathens; and by making good in Heaven the Sentence of the Church given upon Earth, which he would not do, if the Church ſhould have at any time fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in her definition, and that in points damnably errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In the 18. Number I have alledged other Texts, ſtill proving the ſame. In the 19. Number I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that for two Thouſand years together, before the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were written, the true believers had no other ſure ground of their Faith, but the Authority of the Church, which if it had been fallible, the very ground of their Faith had been groundleſſe, and none at all. The firſt Believers alſo, and many whole Nations, had no other ground, then the ſaid Authority of the Church, as there I have ſhewed out of Saint <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and it is clear of it ſelf; for they did not build their Faith on any Scriptures. Thus far I have gone already in the proof of the Infallibility of the Church. Now I go on with thoſe words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 Tim. 3. v. 15.) where the Church of the living God, is called, <hi>The Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> May not Men rely
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40740:55"/> ſecurely upon the Pillar of Truth? May they not ground themſelves aſſuredly on the ground of Truth? No ground being ſurer ground, and more infallible then the ground of Truth it ſelf. Yea, my Adverſary having found a place in St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> calling <hi>the Scripture the Foundation and Pillar of Faith,</hi> doth infer that if it be ſo, <hi>then it is the ground and cauſe of our faith.</hi> If this conſequence be ſtrong (which I deny not) then is it yet a ſtronger, that the Truth is no where ſurer grounded, then upon <hi>the Pillar and Foundation of Truth.</hi> But my Adverſary would take this place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> from me, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>This expreſsion may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be referred (not to the Church, but to the myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs) and ſo be an Hebrew form,</hi> &amp;c. Surely he forgot that this Epiſtle was not written in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but in <hi>Greek;</hi> and then again, No <hi>Hebrew</hi> form in the world can make the ſenſe he intends. What can be clearer then this, if I ſay, <hi>ſuch a thing was done by</hi> Cicero <hi>the Father of his Countrey, and</hi> Caeſar <hi>did ſuch another thing?</hi> What I ſay more clear, then that in this ſpeech I call <hi>Cicero The Father of his Country</hi> and not <hi>Caeſar,</hi> of whom as yet I had not ſo much as ſpoken? So the Apoſtle had not ſo much as ſpoken of any Myſtery, when he ſpoke theſe words, which lie thus in your own Bible, <hi>That thou maiſt know how to behave thy ſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth; and without Controverſie great is the Myſtery of Godlyneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Do you not ſee, that he had not ſo much as ſpoken <hi>of this Myſtery,</hi> when he ſaid the former words, which in all kind of Conſtruction <hi>per Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem,</hi> clearly relate to the Church. O, but my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary tells me, that this title of being <hi>The Pillar and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Truth</hi> agreeth in the firſt place to the Scripture. I anſwer, it agreeth equally to any thing, that is the <hi>True Word of God;</hi> and therefore it agreeth to the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſpeaketh by it &amp; in it; but God alſo ſpeaketh by his Church, and in his Church, giving as much infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Church in a Councel, as he gave to him who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40740:56"/> did deliver his Word in Scripture; for example, as he gave to <hi>Solomon,</hi> who in his own perſon came to play the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is objected alſo, <hi>that in theſe words rather the Office of the Church is ſet forth then her Authority.</hi> To which my Anſwer is clear, that her Authority cannot poſſibly in ſhort words be more ſet out, then by ſaying; that ſhe is <hi>The Pillar and ground of Truth:</hi> for what Authority can rely more ſafely, then that which relyeth <hi>on the Pillar of Truth?</hi> What Authority can be better founded and grounded, then that which is founded and grounded upon the <hi>Ground and Foundation of Truth?</hi> So that nothing can be more clear againſt Scripture, then to ſay, it doth not ſet out the Authority of the Church in this place, No Text being clearer for any thing. Hence when the Church had defined, that God <hi>the Son was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial to his Father,</hi> (that is, of one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) which is no where clearly ſaid in Scripture, St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> calleth this Definition of the Church <hi>the Word of God,</hi> ſaying, that ever hereafter this Definition of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councel, <hi>That Word of God by the</hi> Nicen <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel doth remain for ever and ever</hi> (Ep. ad African. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſc.) Behold here the Definition of the Councel, called <hi>The Word of God remaining for ever and ever.</hi> Is not this to acknowledge the Church Infallible in her Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> That place alſo out of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> proveth ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Churches infallibility. Chriſt there bids his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to teach and Baptize all Nations, adding, <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am with you all dayes, even to the conſummation of the world.</hi> My Adverſary ſaith, It is not neceſſary to extend this Promiſe to Chriſt his being with the Church to the end of the world; which is all one, as to ſay, It is not neceſſary that Chriſt his Promiſe ſhould be true. For ſurely he cannot promiſe more clearly to be with his Church to the end of the world. If he ſhould ſay, I will be with you for a Thouſand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40740:56"/> years, he ſhould not perform his promiſe unleſſe he were with it a thouſand years: wherefore promiſing to be with it <hi>even to the conſummation of the world,</hi> to make his promiſe true he muſt be with them ſo long. Now the Apoſtles were not ſo long as the end of the world baptizing and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but their ſucceſſors are with them, therefore Chriſt muſt be to the conſummation of the world. And though theſe ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles be not ſo worthy of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Aſſiſtance as the Apoſtles were, yet Chriſt giving the gift of infallible aſſiſtance, not for the worth of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom it is given, but for the ſecure direction of ſo many millions as were to be of the Church after Chriſt his time, there is as much, yea far more reaſon why he ſhould leave the like ſecure direction for them; becauſe the further we go from Chriſts time, the more we are ſubject to uncertainties about his Doctrine. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. It being then proved, that Chriſt will be with his Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the conſummation of the world, and it being manifeſt that he is not with thoſe, who live in damnable Errors, we muſt of neceſſity ſay that Chriſts Church in all ages lived ſecured from damnable Errors, or elſe there was ſome Age in which he was not with it, and in which he performed not his promiſe. And the ſame is to be ſaid of that place of St. <hi>John</hi> (14.) <hi>And I will aske the Father, and he will give you another Paraclete that may abide with you for ever, the Spirit of Truth.</hi> This abiding of the ſpirit of Truth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſecures us for ever from all damnable Errors. Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> (l de utilit. cred. c. 6) <hi>If the Providence of God doth not preſide in humane affairs, in vain would ſollicitude be about Religion; but if God be thus preſent with us, truely we are not to deſpair that there is ſome Authority appointed by the ſame God, on which Authority we relying, as on an aſſured ſtep may be lifted up to God.</hi> So he. But if this ſtep be fallible, It is no aſſured ſtep: Gods providence therefore hath left an Infallible Authority in his Church, ſuch an Authority as the firſt Church had for 2000. years before any Scripture was written.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:40740:57"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> And do not tell me that all this is then only true, if the Church judgeth conformably to Scripture: for even in that ſenſe, the Devil himſelf, the Father of Lyes, is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as long as he teacheth conformably to Scriptures, and the Gates of Hell cannot by any error prevail againſt the Devil of Hell: yea, as long as he teacheth conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Scripture, he is <hi>The Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> Hath God in the Texts alledged given no more to the Church, then to the Devils? And how is this anſwer to the purpoſe, ſeeing that for two Thouſand years before Scripture, no man could know what was conformable to Scripture; yea, nothing was then conformable to any Scripture, there being no Scripture at all? And the Church then had not Gods Promiſe, which in all the Texts, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and Reaſons above alledged, is, that the Church ſhall at no time teach any thing that in any damnable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall be againſt Scripture; ſo that when we know this is her Doctrine, we are ſure that this is conformable to the Scriptures rightly underſtood. And thus clearly is fulfilled thoſe notable words in the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> (cap. 2. v. 44.) <hi>In the dayes of thoſe Kingdomes, the God of Heaven will raiſe up a Kingdome which ſhall not be diſſipated, and his Kingdome ſhall not be delivered to another people, and it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all theſe</hi> (Idolatrous) <hi>Kingdomes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Now, of no Kingdome in the world, but of the Kingdome of Chriſts Church, this can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. This Church therefore <hi>ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> And conſequently at no time it ſhall fall into damnable errors: for then it is true, to ſay, <hi>It doth not ſtand, but is faln moſt damnably.</hi> Again, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. God doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare his Covenant with his Church, according to the Interpretation of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf. (Rom. 11.26.) <hi>This is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, my Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40740:57"/> and for ever.</hi> But how could the Word of the Lord more depart from the Mouth of the Church, then if ſhe ſhould with her mouth teach damnable errors? From this therefore he ſecureth his Church for ever and ever. Hence Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, (<hi>l. de Unitat. Eccl. cap.</hi> 6, 7, 12, &amp; 13.) (See him alſo, <hi>l.</hi> 20. <hi>de Civit. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>in Pſalm.</hi> 85. <hi>&amp; de Utilit. Credendi, c.</hi> 8.) <hi>Whoſoever affirmeth the Church to have been overthrown</hi> (as it were, if at any time it ſhould teach any damnable error) <hi>doth rob Chriſt of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Inheritance, bought with his precious Blood;</hi> yea, Saint <hi>Hierom (cont. Lucifer. c.</hi> 6.) goeth farther, and averreth, that <hi>He that ſo ſaith, doth make God ſubject to the Devil, and a poor miſerable Chriſt.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth (after a ſort) bereave the whole Incarnation, Life and Paſſion of our Saviour, of their Effect and End, which was principally to found a Church and Kingdome in this world, which ſhould endure to the day of Judgement, and direct Men in all Truth to Salvation. Wherefore, whoſoever affirmeth the Church to have periſhed, taketh away this effect and Prerogative from his Incarnation, Life, and Paſſion; and avoucheth, that at ſome times Man had no means left to attain to everlaſting bliſſe; which is alſo repugnant to the Mercy and goodneſſe of God. He alſo maketh God ſubject to the Devil, in making the Devil ſtronger then Chriſt, and affirming him to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown Chriſts Church and Kingdome, which our Lord promiſed ſhould never be conquered.</p>
            <p>That the Holy Fathers did believe the Church of Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> to be Infallible, and of an Authority ſufficient to ground Faith upon, appeareth by their relying onely upon her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the chiefeſt Articles of Faith, which is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch and ſuch Books are the true Word of God; and upon this onely ground, they ground this their Faith, as in the 12. Number I have ſhewed Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch Books for Gods Word, and to have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40740:58"/> others, and to have received ſuch <hi>with veneration of Divine Authority,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpoke; And upon this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Authority they all believed God the Father not to be begotten, God the Sonne to be begotten by his Father onely, and to be <hi>Conſubſtantiall</hi> to him; and God the Holy Ghoſt not to be begotten, but to proceed from both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son. Upon this infallible Authority they all held children to be baptized, <hi>though nothing for certain could be alledged out of the Canonical Scriptures in this point,</hi> but onely the Catholique Church taught this to be done, as in the 16th. Numb. have ſhewed out of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who there calleth this relying on the Churches Authority, <hi>The moſt true &amp; inviolable Rule of Faith.</hi> And S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> there alſo ſaith, <hi>that theſe unwritten Traditions of the Church (infallible onely in her Authoritie) are as worthy of faith and credit, as that which is written in Scripture.</hi> And in the 19th. Numb. I have ſhewed out of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> That we ſhould have bin as much obliged to believe although no Scriptures had been written, as we are now, and that the faith of whole Nations is grounded not in Scripture, but conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the infallible Authority of the Church, whoſe word he calleth the Word of God, as I ſhewed in the end of the 22th. Number. I ſumme up all theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, that my Adverſary may not ſay (as he did) that the authority of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſingle, when he believed the Goſpel to be Gods Word upon the infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church: for if her authority be by ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acknowledged infallible, then St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in his opinion in this point.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> But becauſe that place of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh home, and becauſe my Adverſary ſaith, <hi>That if we take this paſſage by it ſelf, it ſeemeth to ſpeak high,</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>if we conſider the tenour of Saint</hi> Auſtins <hi>diſcourſe in the whole chapter, It is like we will begin to think that it came from him in ſome heat of ſpirit to overcome his Adverſary.</hi> For theſe cauſes (I ſay) I will conſider the tenour of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Diſcourſe in this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40740:58"/> whole Chapter, and I will ſhew manifeſtly, that this his Doctrine was ſo far <hi>from coming out from him in ſome heat of Spirit to overcome his adverſary,</hi> that he maketh it the very prime Ground of his diſcourſe; and without he will ſtand to that Ground, he there muſt needs ſeem to ſay nothing againſt his Adverſary. This Chapter is the fourth Chapter, <hi>Cont. Ep. Manichaei.</hi> The whole ſubſtance of it is this; <hi>The Epiſtle of</hi> Manichaeus <hi>beginneth thus,</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus <hi>the Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, by the Providence of God the Father. I ask therefore, ſaith Saint</hi> Auſtin <hi>who this</hi> Manichaeus <hi>is? You will anſwer, the Apoſtle of Chriſt. I do not believe it. Perhaps you will read the Goſpel unto me, endevouring thence to prove it. And what if you did fall upon one who did not as yet believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, what would you do then, if ſuch an one ſaid I do not believe you?</hi> This is his firſt Argument, to ſhew that his Adverſary by citing Texts out of the Goſpel to prove <hi>Manichaeus</hi> a true Apoſtle, could prove nothing againſt thoſe, who as yet have not believed the Goſpel: then he goeth on; But becauſe I am not one, who have not yet believed the Goſpel, and ſo this Anſwer cannot ſerve me, notwithſtanding, I muſt tell you, that I am ſuch an one, that <hi>I would not believe the Goſpel, without the Authority of the Catholick Church did move me.</hi> This being the ground of his Anſwer, you ſhall ſee how he builds upon this, and onely this Ground. It followeth then thus; <hi>I having therefore obeyed thoſe</hi> (Catholique Paſtors) <hi>ſaying, Believe the Goſpel</hi> (the moſt Important point of Points) <hi>Why ſhould I not obey them ſaying to me, do not believe Manichaeus?</hi> Then upon this ground he preſſeth home, ſaying, <hi>Chuſe which you will; if you ſay believe the Catholiques, then I muſt not believe you, for they teach me not to give Faith to you: wherefore believing them (as I do) I cannot believe you. Now, if you ſay, do not believe the Catholiques, then you do not go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to force me by the Goſpel to give Faith to Manichaeus.</hi> Why ſo? Mark if his ground be not as I told you, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:40740:59"/> (ſaith he) <hi>I have believed the Goſpel it ſelfe upon the preaching of the Catholiques.</hi> Can he more clearly ground upon the Infallible Authority of their teaching, then upon this, to believe the Goſpel it ſelfe? He goeth on thus: Again, <hi>If you hold to the Goſpel, my hold ſhall ſtill be on the Authority of that Church, upon whoſe Authority I believed the Goſpel. I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will hold my ſelf to thoſe, by whoſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching I have believed the Goſpel, and theſe commanding me, I will not believe thee.</hi> And Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> goeth ſo far upon this Ground, as a Ground Infallible, that he ſaith, <hi>If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you</hi> Manichaeans <hi>can find me any clear place in the Goſpel to prove that Apoſtleſhip of</hi> Manichaeus, <hi>that then indeed they ſhall weaken the Authority of the Catholiques.</hi> But what do you think will follow? I pray note it well. <hi>Their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity being weakned</hi> (and ſhewed once fallible) <hi>now neither can I ſo much as believe the Goſpel.</hi> And why ſo? Becauſe <hi>upon the Authority of theſe Catholiques, I had believed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> The ground of his belief in the Goſpel, was their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority, as not onely theſe, but alſo the next words ſhew manifeſtly. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if in the Goſpel, there be found nothing, that is evident to prove the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip of</hi> Manichaeus, <hi>then I will believe the Catholiques rather then You. But if You ſhall read me out of the Goſpel ſomething that is evident to prove</hi> Manichaeus <hi>an Apoſtle, then I will neither believe the Catholiques nor thee.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>I will not believe the Catholiques, becauſe they</hi> (whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I thought Infallible) <hi>have lyed to me concerning your</hi> Manichaeans: <hi>But I will not believe thee even when thou citeſt clear Scripture</hi> (for of this caſe he ſpeaketh) and why ſo? <hi>Becauſe thou doſt cite me that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Could he more clearly ſay, that if once in one ſingle Lye, he ſhould finde the Churches Authority to be fallible, he ſhould then have left unto him, no Infallible Ground at all, upon which he were to believe Scripture. To deliver a Doctrine thus inculcated over and over again,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40740:59"/> and thus ſtill relying on this one Ground, is far, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from letting a word ſlip in heat of diſputation. And therefore (to ſpeak plainly) my Adverſary could not deal ſincerely, when he ſaid, <hi>If we conſidered the whole Chapter we ſhould be of his minde:</hi> for nothing can make us leſſe of his minde, then to conſider the whole Chapter, as I have faithfully done, excepting one little parcel in the end, which moſt ſtrongly confirmes all I have ſaid; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, but God forbid I ſhould not believe the Goſpel (having ſo Infallible Authority for it, as the Church is) <hi>yet believing this Goſpel, I do not ſee, how I can believe thee</hi> (teaching me <hi>Manichaeus</hi> to be an Apoſtle:) for we know which Apoſtle it was, who was choſen in the place of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> the Traytor; <hi>This we have read in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> did not believe the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, he addeth, <hi>which Book</hi> (of the <hi>Acts) I muſt neceſſarily believe, if I believe the Goſpel.</hi> And why? <hi>Becauſe the Catholique Authority doth in like manner commend both theſe Scriptures to me.</hi> See here again moſt evidently he ſaith, the Ground upon which he believeth the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, as well as he believed the other Scriptures to be the ſelf-ſame <hi>Catholique Authority,</hi> which in one and the ſame manner commendeth both Scriptures to us to be believed. Had he ſaid, that he believed this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture for the Light he received by the reading of it, by which he diſcovered it to be Canonical, then the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> might as eaſily have ſaid, that by the like Light we clearly diſcover the Goſpel of <hi>Manichaeus</hi> to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. Thus I have given a large and moſt faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Chapter, ſetting moſt of it down word for word. And this laſt place, as alſo many other, quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow what my Adverſary ſaith, that he ſpoke here of himſelf, as now a <hi>Manichaean:</hi> for you ſee he ſpeaketh of himſelf, as one believing the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and believing it by a neceſſary conſequence, becauſe he hath already believed the other Canonical Books upon the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40740:60"/> ſame Authority of the Church. And if upon this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I may with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> believe the whole Scripture to be Gods Word from the beginning to the ending, though it containeth ſo many ſtrange Stories, &amp; ſuch a world of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points, why may I not upon the ſame Infallible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity believe Prayers to Saints, Prayer for the dead and other like points? Neither can it be ſaid, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (as my Adverſary ſaith) was ſettled in the belief of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the authority of Scripture it ſelf, for I have given you his plain words to the contrary, ſaying, <hi>that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (of the Church) <hi>being weakned, he cannot now ſo much as believe the Goſpel,</hi> which he might ſtill do if he believed it for it ſelf, and not merely for the Infallible Authority of the Church: yea, (<hi>l. de Utilit. Cred. cap.</hi> 14.) he ſaith, that <hi>his belief in Chriſt was grounded upon that Authority,</hi> which certainly he muſt then needs hold for Infallible. If he did thus and was never noted for ſingularity in his faith for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, why may not I prudently doe what he did? Yea, how can I poor ſimple creature, not doe imprudently, if I refuſe to do, what he did, who underſtood the Scriptures as well as any man the Church had?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Having now ſhewed the Church to be the Judge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt for all Controverſies, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of this Judge is Infallible, and conſequently a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for Faith, I will now ſhow that all this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine muſt be applyed to the Roman Church, and cannot be applyed to the Proteſtant Church. For firſt this Proteſtant Church doth not ſo much as lay claim either to have any ſuch Authority as being Judge in all Points of Controverſie, or to the having any infallible Authority. If either of theſe belonged to her, ſhe would know her own right, from which ſhe now diſclaims; and ſo by her own doctrine ſhe cannot be Judge, or infallible; for ſo as an Infallible Iudge, ſhe ſhould judge her ſelf to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible No more need to be ſaid to exclude her or any other Church, acknowledging by evident and infallible Scripture
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40740:60"/> (as they profeſs) their own fallibility, and that they are not Iudges in Controverſies, being infallibly fallible, and ſo uncapable of theſe Priviledges, as is Evident. And even this might ſerve to exclude all other Churches, but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> She onely claimeth (as ſhe is bound to do) her due right to be Judge in all Controverſies, and her infallible authority to decide them with truth. All other Churches of all other Religions doe ſay indeed, that they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the onely true Churches, but none of them ſay themſelves to be either the Judges of Controverſies, or to be infallible. Wherefore they cannot be either judges, or infallible; for if they be true Judges, then they judge tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt themſelves, when they judge it to be as certain as Scripture, that there is no Judge but Scripture; And if they be truly infallible in defining them, they truly and by infallible authority define themſelves to be fallible, whileſt they define it to be Scripture, that the true Church is fallable. Wherefore infallibly they are fallible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently infallibly they are not the true Church, which we have demonſtrated to be infallible, and all thoſe Texts, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and Reaſons muſt needs prove all Churches falſe that be fallible, whileſt they prove the true Church neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be infallible: But all Churches beſides the <hi>Roman,</hi> by their own faith are according to infallible Scripture, fallible. None of them therefore is the true Church. If then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church be not the true Church, then Chriſt hath no true Church left on Earth, nor hath not had theſe many Ages.</p>
            <p>Hence you may gather, why I never was ſollicitous to prove all that was ſaid of the Church by the Scriptures and Fathers to be ſaid of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: for whileſt I did ſhew them to be ſaid of ſuch a Church as might be of an Authority infallibile and ſufficient to ground Faith; It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed manifeſtly, that all was ſaid of the <hi>Roman,</hi> no other being Infallible, and ſo Chriſt ſhould have no true Church, if this be not a true one: For I have demonſtrated, that no other can be Infallible. This being a Demonſtration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40740:61"/> this Argument be anſwered, I hold my ſelf bound to ſay no more, yet I muſt needs tell you in brief a ſmall part of that, which I can and will ſay, if this point be again preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: I will ſhew how unanimouſly the Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, St. <hi>Cyprian (Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 1.) ſaith, <hi>that falſe Faith cannot have Acceſs to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome (in</hi> 1. <hi>ad Tim.</hi>) calleth <hi>Damaſus</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome, The Rector of the Houſe of God,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the Pillar and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of truth.</hi> And in his Epiſtle to the ſame Pope, he ſaith, <hi>To your Holineſs,</hi> that is, <hi>to the Chair of</hi> Peter, <hi>I am joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in communion: Upon this Rock I know the Church to be built. He that gathers not with thee, ſcatters.</hi> So the Fathers in the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> at the voice of St. <hi>Leo</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Peter hath ſpoken by the mouth of Leo.</hi> And many ſuch other places I will alledge, for which now I remit you to <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who both ſhew moſt diligently how all other Churches have gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive judgement in their chief Cauſes. See this done in all Ages, in <hi>Bell.</hi> 3. <hi>De Verbo Dei, e.</hi> 6. I will ſhew alſo how all Churches of all Ages, which were not confeſſed Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Schiſmatical Churches, have been ever joyned in communion to the <hi>Roman</hi> until St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the greats time, and then ever ſince; and how in his time <hi>England</hi> received the ſame <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, which now all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques profeſſe, and all Proteſtants deny. And I will ſhew that this faith then brought into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> did not in any point of Faith controverted between the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques and the Proteſtants, differ from that undoubted true Apoſtolical Faith, which our old <hi>Brittains</hi> received from <hi>Rome,</hi> in the ſecond age of the Church in the dayes of <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> and from hence the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Churches communion in Doctrine with the Ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Church will appear. I will ſhew that perpetual viſibility agreeth onely to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that in her onely that Propheſie concerning Chriſt was fulfilled, <hi>That he ſhould reigne in the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40740:61"/> ever, and of his reign there ſhall be no end.</hi> We can ſhew how he hath reigned here by known and manifeſt Paſtors of the Church, who have in all ages appeared in Councils to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Church. I pray ſet us but know the name of one of your Paſtors, Doctors or Preachers in thoſe laſt thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ages, which preceded <hi>Luther.</hi> All are bound to be of the true Church, but to be of an inviſible Church, having onely Inviſible Paſtors adminiſtring Sacraments in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible manner, no man can be bound to be of. I will ſhew that all converſions of Nations from Idolatry (ſo often promiſed to be made by the true Church) were all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them made by ſuch, as did communicate with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and no one Nation ever converted from Paganiſme by thoſe who profeſſed Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or held theſe points in which Proteſtants differ from us. I will add alſo, that all who have been eminent for ſanctity of Life, or glory of Miracles, have all been joyned in communion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and you cannot name any one famous in either of theſe reſpects, whom you can prove to have been a Proteſtant, a moſt evident ſign of the Truth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Compare any other Church to it in all theſe points here mentioned, and you ſhall ſee all incomparably more verified in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, then in any other differing from her, or agreeing with you, yea verified in none but her.</p>
            <p>I have then I hope performed my Promiſe to ſhew a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> clear way, how in the midſt of ſo many Religions, to find the true One by the Infallible Authority of the Catholick Church, which I have ſhewed to be the Judge in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Faith, and of Authority ſufficient to ground true Faith upon, and that when all this is done. <hi>This is that holy and direct way, ſo direct unto us, that fools cannot erre by it,</hi> and wiſe men muſt erre, if they walk not by it.</p>

               <hi>The Concluſion,</hi> Shewing the Reply to my Papers to have been fully anſwered in the former Diſcourſe.</head>
            <head type="sub">This Reply conſiſteth of Eight Anſwers, with a word or two at the end, and at the beginning of theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</head>
            <head type="sub">To all theſe in Order.</head>
            <p>FIrſt at the beginning, you ſay there is little reaſon for you to rejoyn, becauſe I wave the Application of my diſcourſe, as to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I anſwer, That my Poſition was, that the Church is the Ground of Faith: Of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it was to no end to ſpeak, until I had been firſt granted that ſome Church or other was the Ground of Faith. A man muſt firſt prove to a <hi>Jew,</hi> that the Meſſias is come, and then he muſt prove that Chriſt was this Meſſias. Again, all my Proofs proved an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church to be the ground of Faith, of which no fallible Church could be a ſure Ground, as is manifeſt: But all Churches but the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do profeſs according to Scripture themſelves to be fallible; whence it followeth, that all Churches (but the <hi>Roman</hi>) muſt needs be fallible. For if they or any of them be infallible, then they teach the infallible Truth, when they teach themſelves to be fallible. No Church therefore can be Infallible, but ſhe who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelf to be Infallible. Conſequently, when I proved the Infallible Churches Authority to be the ground of Faith, I proved the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be ſo. See this fully anſwered, Numb. 27.28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You ſay you might ſtill have left me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your firſt Paper with the ſecond Paper. I reply, that this is onely to ſtand to what you have ſaid, as I alſo do. Let the Reader judge with indifferency.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40740:62"/>
            <p>Thirdly, You ſay, I conclude not contradictorily. I reply, that I alwayes conclude the Churches Authority to be a ſufficient ground of Faith, you ſay, it is an inſufficient ground. Reader, judge whether theſe two be not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, ſufficient and inſufficient.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Now to your Eight Anſwers in Order.</head>
            <p>In your firſt Anſwer, you ſpent ſeven pages to prove the Scripture to be a ſufficient ground of Faith. This, This it is, not to conclude contradictorily. You ſhould conclude, that the Church cannot be a ſufficient ground of Faith; which ſtill may be, and is true, though it alſo be moſt true, that the Scripture is a moſt ſufficient ground of Faith, when it is once known by an infallible Authority to be Gods Word, and alſo when we evidently know, that ſuch and ſuch is the undoubted ſenſe of the Scripture. But I have proved at large, that we cannot know upon infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authority, which books be or be not Gods Word, but by the Authority of an infallible Church. See Numb. 11, &amp; 12. And conſequently, if the Churches Authority be not a ſufficient ground for Faith, then we can have no Faith to believe, which books be Gods Word, which not, See Numb. 26. The Churches authority is hence proved to be a ſufficient ground for Faith, and to be our firſt ground: for we muſt firſt upon the authority of the Church believe ſuch and ſuch Books to be Gods Word; and then aſſured by this our belief that they be Gods Word, we may ground our Faith upon the authority of that Word of God, which in this ſenſe I hold to be a moſt ſufficient ground for all Faith, extended to all points clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in Scripture. This and onely this all your Authorities prove. Take for an Example, your firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> out of which you neither do nor can infer any more, then, that the Scripture (once believed to be Gods Word) is to us a ſufficient ground of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40740:63"/> in it ſelf it is <hi>The Pillar and Foundation of Truth:</hi> but by the Authority of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (which is a ſtronger Authority then that of Saint <hi>Irenaeus) The Church is the Pillar and Foundation of Truth:</hi> Therefore her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a ſufficient ground of Faith, even according to this your ſtrong Argument. This I ſhewed, Numb. 22. Yea, Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> expreſly teacheth, that though there were no Scripture at all, yet we ſhould all be bound to believe what we now believe, as I have ſhewed Numb. the. 19. And yet then we ſhould have no other Authority, then that of the Church. Again, the Scriptures can then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground Faith when they contain the Matter about which we are bound to have Faith; but very often they do not contain this Matter, as I have ſhewed, Numb. 9.10.11, 12. and chiefly Numb. 15. and 16. Theſe points not being contained in Scripture, how can I believe them for the Scripture? Laſtly, the Authority of Scripture one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can ground Faith in thoſe points, which are known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be delivered in ſuch clear Texts, as a man cannot prudently doubt of the ſence; but a number of things are to be believed, which be not thus ſet down in Scripture, as hath been ſhewed in the places cited. See alſo Numb. 14. In other Caſes I never deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the ground of Faith, but I ſay, that as God ſpoke by the pens of thoſe who writt Scripture, ſo he ſpeaketh by the Tongue of his Church in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and therefore theſe his words are alſo to be believed, as I fully ſhewed, Numb. 21.22, 23, 24, 25, 26. The Scripture in the Caſes I here ſpecified, is a ſufficient ground of Faith, as your authorities well prove, and ſo is the authority of the Church, as I have fully proved in the places cited.</p>
            <p>In your ſecond Anſwer, all you ſay is, that the Church cannot ground our Faith, but I have fully ſhewed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the places cited.</p>
            <p>In your third Anſwer, you come to anſwer the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40740:63"/> I brought out of Holy Fathers and Scriptures, and this taketh you up unto your 27. Page My Reply is, that in this Paper I have made good Authorities and Teſtimonies ſufficiently abundant to convince what I undertook, and I have fully refuted the chief things you ſaid againſt the chief places, as may appear fully out of the Numb. 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, &amp; 26. where at large I have ſhewed your leſſe ſincere proceeding about the prime authority of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> whoſe authority in the precedent Number I ſhewed not to be ſingle.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Anſwer, you ſay you take not Canonical Books to be Canonical for the authority of the Church. I Reply, that if you do not take them to be ſo on this authority, yet the holy Fathers did, as I have ſhewed Numb. 12.25, 26. And if you believe them to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical onely upon the Light given in them to you to ſee this verity, your ground is far more fallible then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a General Council, as I have demonſtrated Numb. 13.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Anſwer, you endevour to ſhew, that you ground not your Faith on your own private judgement of diſcretion, but I have ſhewed fully the contrary, Nu. 3, 4, 7.</p>
            <p>In the ſixt Anſwer, you rejoyce to ſee me confeſſe the Scripture to be the Rule of Faith and Manners, as if I had at any time denyed this. Neither doth this Confeſſion deſtroy my Poſition, that the Church is the Ground of our Belief. Can I not ground my Faith upon what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, becauſe I can ground it upon that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith? Why is the Scripture the Rule of Faith? Becauſe it delivereth to me Gods Written Word. But the Church delivereth to me Gods Word written and unwritten, I may therefore alſo rule my ſelf by that. The moſt right Rule of Scripture is often ſo crookedly applyed, that he is blind who ſeeth not that we need to have better ſecurity of Interpretation, then our own private diſcretion of Judgement can afford, as I have fully proved Num. 4.14.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40740:64"/> Of the Infallibility of the Church in Interpreting, I have fully proved our Doctrine, Numb. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh Anſwer, you taxe me with being loath to own the Roman Church. Why I did not ſpeak of the Roman Church, I told you here in the beginning, it was becauſe you would conclude as there you do, The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church is not the Ground of Faith, therefore the Roman is not. I have fully ſhewed the contrary, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Catholique Church to be the ground of our Faith; and out of ſuperabundance I have ſhewed this Church to be the Roman Church. See Numb. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>In the eighth Anſwer, you charge me in differing from my ſelfe, becauſe before I taught the ground of Believing to be the Authority of the Church, and now I ſay, it is the Authority of God Revealing. My Reply is exceeding eaſie. The Ground of our Faith is God Revealing, and God Revealing by his Church: as he firſt cauſeth our firſt Belief, when he tells us by his Church ſuch and ſuch Books are Infallibly his Word. God Revealing is alwaies the formal object of Faith, but ſometimes God Revealeth his minde by Scriptures, and ſometimes by the Church, as he did for two Thouſand yeares and more, before the Scriptures were written. The Prophets before they did write, did ſay, <hi>This ſaith the Lord,</hi> to wit, this he ſaid by their Mouths: So ſay I, <hi>This and this ſaith our Lord</hi> by the Mouth of his Church; as I have ſhewed Numb. 22. Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to ſpeak, and I have ſhewed, Numb. 28. The General Councel of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to have ſaid <hi>Peter hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the mouth of Leo</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus Gods Revelation cometh to us by the Church: She and onely She teacheth us theſe and theſe Scriptures to be Gods Word. We muſt firſt believe her, before we can come to have Infallible Ground to believe Scriptures, as I have fully ſhewed. After we have believed Scripture, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by Scripture onely know the undoubted ſenſe of many
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40740:64"/> neceſſary places in Scripture, as hath been ſhewed. Again, all things neceſſary to be believed, be not ſet down in Scripture, as hath alſo been ſhewed fully. The Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God coming to us in all theſe caſes by the Church, you by your own words, in this place, muſt grant her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be our ordinary cauſe of Faith.</p>
            <p>At the end of theſe your Anſwers, you would fain ſeem to have ſpoken properly in accuſing us of Exceſſe of Faith: But your diſtinction doth no way ſalve the Impropriety of the Speech, for there is ſtill a difference in <hi>more</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Objects, and believing <hi>more</hi> Objects: but granting that it may be improperly ſpoken, yet even in that Senſe it is not truly ſaid, becauſe there can be no Exceſſe of Faith in believing what God ſaith; for believing upon an Infallible Authority all that we believe, we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more then we ſhould, if we believe no more things, then be grounded upon that Infallible Authority (as we do not:) And conſequently we do no more; then believe ſuch things as have for their Warrant, <hi>This faith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now anſwered your Paper from the beginning to the end, I am moſt willing to take your own cloſe out of Saint <hi>Auſtin, Againſt Reaſon, no ſober Man will go, againſt Scriptures no Chriſtian, againſt the Church no Peace-maker;</hi> adding his other words (<hi>Tr.</hi> 32. <hi>in Joan.) Let us believe my Brethren, ſo much as a Man loveth the Church, juſt ſo much he hath of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                  <p>I Cannot anſwer it to God, nor to his Church with us, if I let you ſeem to your ſelf, or to others of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that you have the Victory, untill you have overcome your Error; therefore you will excuſe me if I ſtill follow you.</p>
                  <p>To your Preface then. If the Roman Catholiques have often foretold, that by permitting freely to all ſorts of people the reading of the Scriptures in their Mother-tongue, multitudes of new Sects and Hereſies would not fail to grow up in numberleſſe number; and as for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Manners, they would grow worſe and worſe (as you ſay in the beginning) then are your Roman Catholiques, in this, falſe Prophets; becauſe they ſeem (by you) to make that the cauſe of Hereſies and bad Manners. This is plainly <hi>fallacia non cauſa,</hi> or the fallacy of accident. And ſecondly, it is contrary to that of our Saviour Chriſt, Saint <hi>Mark</hi> the 12.24. <hi>Do you not therefore erre, not knowing the Scriptures, and the power of God?</hi> By our Saviour, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures is not the cauſe of erring, but the not knowing of the Scriptures is the cauſe of erring: <hi>You do therefore erre not knowing the Scriptures, which are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. And thirdly, You confeſſe in this Paper, that when we are by the Church aſſured that the Scripture is the Word of God, we may Ground our Faith in it, for thoſe things which are plainly delivered. And fourthly, How cometh it to paſſe then, that ſome of thoſe, in whom
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40740:65"/> Infallibility (as you think) is veſted, have been Hereticks and lewd: the former of which indeed you do much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but is exemplified in <hi>Liberius</hi>'s ſubſcribing againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi> as you may ſee fully proved by our <hi>Reinolds</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your <hi>Hart.</hi> And ſurely was that alſo an action of bad Manners. Therefore if your Church were the true Church, yet doth it not (you ſee) teach the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation infallibly, and therefore can we not by it infallibly diſcerne the true Religion from the falſe. Indeed the Catholick Church hath taught the infallible way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: but that was the Scripture, as I proved by many Teſtimonies; and this was a teaching the infallible way by conſequence, becauſe it did teach the Scripture, which is the infallible way: yet hath it not in particular points, taught the infallible way infallibly. Neither are we by the Church infallibly reſolved, that the Scripture is the Word of God, although the authority of the true Church be a motive herein, yet is it not that wherein ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ground our Faith of the Scriptures, as I have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then you ſay that we cannot have, as things ſtand, any other aſſurance to ground our Faith upon ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (namely then the Church) you do ſtill but <hi>fortiter ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> for we cannot ground our aſſurance ſecurely upon the Church. And ſecondly, Whereas you ſay, that as things ſtand, we have no other aſſurance, &amp;c. you do not well conſider what you ſay, or I do not underſtand what you mean: for hereby you do intimate that the Church is not the ground of our Faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but that which is indeed the ground of our Faith, muſt be ſo abſolutely and univerſally, as farre as is neceſſary: the Church ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is but the beſt of the kinde, amongſt thoſe which are humane; but we muſt have a Divine indefectible ground for our Divine Faith, in which there cannot be falſity. Neither thirdly, Is the Church the firſt ground, becauſe by it we believe the Scripture to be the Word of God;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40740:66"/> becauſe, if we did by it believe the Scripture, then we are not firſt to believe it by the Scripture. And if whatſoever credence we do give to it, we do give by authority of the Scripture, then are we firſt to believe the Scripture, and then that is the firſt ground. Fourthly, In that you ſay you did never deny; that when we are by the Infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church aſſured of the Scripture to be the Word of God, we may believe ſuch things as are clearly contained in Scripture, &amp;c. you ſay that which concludes againſt the practice of the Church, not to permit the uſe of Scripture unto the People; and alſo you do abate of the Univerſal Propoſition in the firſt Paper, that Divine Faith in all things is cauſed by the propoſal of the Church; and therefore if you would hold you to this, the Controverſie would be leſſened betwixt us: for <hi>dato non conceſſo,</hi> that we are bound to believe the Scripture to be the Word of God by the authority of the Church, yet when we do thus believe it, then the immediate ground of our Faith in thoſe things clearly ſet down, is the written Word of God, and not the authority of the Church. So then your firſt Number is indeed in no Number, for you cannot mean thus, that we cannot believe any thing propoſed plainly in Scripture, unleſſe we believe the authority of the Church in that particular. And therefore when you have proved the authority of the Church to be that which cauſeth and determineth our Faith of Scripture to be the Word of God, you will ſay leſſe then formerly, and untill you do prove it, you ſay nothing.</p>
                  <p>As touching the expreſſions you make, in the ſecond Number, of him who anſwered the Papers, give him leave, if not to be the adverſary herein, yet to differ from you, and to think himſelf to be one of the moſt ſlender Sons of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Neither did you intend by courteous and reſpective words to draw him to your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Soft words alone will not do it, but ſoft words with hard arguments may do more. When we ſee a clear
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40740:66"/> demonſtration of truth, it is no courteſie to yeild aſſent, for the Underſtanding cannot refuſe Truth when it doth ſhew it ſelfe; But whether the Reply (as you ſpeak) be as clear a demonſtration as any wiſe man can hope for in this matter, let me have the liberty and the civility (if in theſe buſineſſes it hath any place) not to determine. Only it is very hard to ſay, who doth <hi>optimum quod ſic,</hi> as they ſpeak, the beſt of the kinde. Yet alſo wiſe men may think, that if there can be nothing more expected towards ths defence of your firſt poſition, the cauſe is wanting to it. And certainly ſuch a wiſe man and ingenuous (as you be) will not content himſelfe with any aſcertainment, but that which is abſolute, and uncapable of Error. Therefore not to deceive you by your own commendations, put it to iſſue, bring it to the teſt, try the debate betwixt us by this rule of Wiſdome and Conſcience alſo, <hi>Tene quod certum eſt, relinque quod incertum.</hi> It is certain that the Scripture is Infallible, and you confeſſe it; it is not certain that the Church is Infallible, and I deny it. Which then ſhould you take to be the Rule and Ground and Cauſe of Faith?</p>
                  <p>As for the good deſigne you mention here, and in your Title, to guide Souls redeemed by Chriſt to the happy Eternity; I congratulate to you that deſire, but I am ſorry that ſuch a zeal is better then the way you lead them in. Aſſuredly thoſe Souls redeemed by the Blood of Chriſt, may and ſhall come to happineſſe, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge of Controverſies on Earth. For firſt, thoſe things which are neceſſary to Salvation are plain in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; matters of queſtion we are in no ſuch danger by the ignorance of, reſerving a purpoſe not to contradict what we ſhall be convinced in on either part. Secondly, We may be directed in theſe points by Judges, though not Infallible, as unto the quiet of the Church. Thirdly, Untill your Infallible Judge appears to be truly ſuch, it is the beſt way not to be bound intuitively to his dictates:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40740:67"/> for then we might be in poſſibility of being bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an errour which is repugnant to the underſtanding, <hi>Ex natura rei.</hi> So that until you make good the Title of an infallible Judge, whom (as you ſay) we are obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of damnation not to disbelieve, I ſhall <hi>hold up my hand</hi> onely in admiration of your confidence.</p>
                  <p>And whileſt you do demonſtrate this, (that we are bound under pain of damnation not to disbelieve this Judge of yours;) You ſay you do demonſtrate your former Poſition that the infallible Authority of the Catholique Church is the ground of our Faith. So you, yes, becauſe you ſay that the Catholique Church is the infallible Judge: To this, thus. Is it the infallible Judge whereunto we are bound to ſubmit our underſtandings in all things, or not? if in all things, then we cannot believe what the Scripture ſaith in plain points without the propoſal of the Church; which now ſeems contrary to your mind, if not in all things, but onely whether the Scripture be the Word of God, or in caſes of Controverſie; then do you now go leſſe then in your former paper, &amp; againſt the nature of implicite Faith:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the authority of the Church is not it upon which we reſolvedly reſt our Faith of the Scripture; or the determination of Controverſies, we ſhall ſee when you come to it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what do you mean by the Church? do you underſtand it formally of the people, or repreſentatively in an Aſſembly of the Paſtors, if you mean it of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo; how is infallibility veſted in them? Are we bound to ſtand to their judgement? and they are to be in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Paſtors. Well then; it muſt be underſtood of their Paſtors. What? of all? or moſt? or one? If of all, when did they all Vote? if of moſt, when did moſt Vote? If of one ordinary Paſtor, with, or in a General Council; then remember whenſoever in your ſenſe you name a Church, it be ſo taken of the Pope and his Council General, which yet you will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40740:67"/> not evince to be infallible by their authority. If they were infallible, they muſt be infallible by the Word of God, as to us; and then that again is the firſt ground of Faith: and alſo ſecondly, you will find that many priviledges which you have ſpoken of as to the Church, do not belong to the Church Repreſentative ſtrictly, but to all the people of the Church as inviſible; which, as ſuch comes not into this Controverſie. If then you come again in any diſcourſe, keep you within, and to the bounds of the queſtion; and ſpeak of the authority of the Church in the ſame ſenſe, as to be the ground of Faith Divine in all points, or in the ſame particulars. For if you proceed from the Churches being the ground of faith as towards the Scripture to be the Word of God: To conclude, that therefore it is the ground of faith indefinitely or univerſally, you commit the fallacy <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid;</hi> as alſo, if you proceed from its being the ground of Faith in points of Controverſie to the being the ground of Faith in all things, the diſcourſe hath the ſame fault. And yet you ſay, that in your progreſſe you leave nothing of concernment in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unanſwered; and alſo that you conclude contradictorily to me.</p>
                  <p>Sir, Let me here uſe my Liberty for your good. If you had a mind to leave nothing in my reply of moment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered, you would have followed me as a diſputant, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; you would have oppoſed diſtinction to ſome inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent arguments, (for profeſſedly the anſwerer is not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.) You would have given me anſwer to anſwer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to teſtimonies, with ſhewing either their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency or invaliditie. And that excuſe of yours, leſt you ſhould be <hi>too long,</hi> is ſurely too ſhort to cover you. That is not long whereof nothing can be abated as he ſaid, and that is my excuſe. And ſurely your Treatiſe is too long, not only by your many repetitions which ſwell your paper; but would have been too long, had it been leſſe, it is too long by it ſelf. Who ever anſwered a rejoynder with a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40740:68"/> Treatiſe? Shall I ſay, that by your form of a Treatiſe, it may ſeem that you have more mind to treat then to fight, I am loath to be ſo bold; neither doth it become my ſpirit to tell you that you do not ſtand your ground; but you do not neither conclude contradictorily, if your Treatiſe did prove that the authoritie of your Church is the ground of Faith in the Divinitie of the Scripture, and in caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: For your firſt paper ſpoke univerſally, my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer denied it, and now you would prove it if you could particularly. If you would conclude contradictorily to me, you ſhould have concluded in the ſame quantitie affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to my negative. This you here ſeem not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, yet in other parts of your Treatiſe you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it.</p>
                  <p>And in the end you would arm your Treatiſe againſt me, as if there were no difference betwixt Poſitive and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive Divinity. And this you doe by references, but you ſhould not have put the ſuit to reference without my conſent.</p>

               <hi>So much for the Preface.</hi> After the Preface you come to the Proof of the Title. You mean the Title of this Paper, which ſurely needs not to be proved, becauſe it is not delivered by way of Affirmation, but of Diſquiſition.</head>
            <p>ANd as for the Similitude (you ſay) of St. <hi>Anſelme,</hi> we like it very well. For, if the Tables be turned, it doth very aptly belong to you; who if you have not with a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> contention for Maſterie pulled out the Eyes of Men, yet have put out the Light, not allowing them the uſe of the Scripture: you ſhut up the people in Darkneſſe and will not let them ſee <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſſe in his own Orb of Scripture,</hi> for fear it may be he ſhould not ſeem now to riſe, but to go down in <hi>Rome:</hi> and inſtead hereof you leave Men to walk by the Light of the <hi>Pope;</hi> whom one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40740:68"/> to the Sun, as the Emperour to the Moon. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> you ſay not, yea, you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the uſe of all humble ſeeking of God for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth; becauſe you have ſaid that we muſt all ſubmit our aſſents to the determinations of the Church: So you ſee how your Opinion is practically impious, and is diſagreeable to your own directions: For you ſay, if they ſhould ſeek (of God) they ſhould find. Onely you ſay, we ſhould ſet all paſſions &amp; prejudice aſide, &amp; with a calm hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind beg of God to give us this grace of ſeeking truth.</p>
            <p>Surely, this Qualification of our addreſſe to God for the finding of Truth is very good, and I would it were as well practiſed as delivered: but let the world judge who is like to be moſt wanting in this Devotion, and to exceed in paſſion and prejudice; He who affirms all to be delivered infallibly by the Church, or he that ſearcheth in Scripture particular Truths. Infallibility pretended eaſily makes any man paſſionate againſt difference, unleſſe indeed he could make it good. And he that is infallible is in right capacitie ſure to have a neceſſary prejudice againſt <hi>different Opinions.</hi> Neither ſince the times of the Apoſtles hath humilitie been uſually ſeen to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Indeed we do not inherit Religion as Lands: but if, when we come to abilitie of diſcerning (which your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in its Principles will never let you come to) we ſee good cauſe for our Religion: Surely we have no reaſon to leave it, becauſe it was our Fathers, although we doe not embrace it, becauſe it was our Fathers. The relation it hath to our Anceſtours hath no more moment in it then the Church may have upon you, namely to be a conſiderable motive, not to be your ultimate reſolution, thus for the

            <p>But therefore in your ſecond Number you will prove your way by Scripture. We now come to it. And your Text is, <hi>Eſay</hi> the 35. from the fourth Verſe to the ninth, by parcels, <hi>Say to the faint-hearted, Take courage, and fear not; behold, God himſelfe will come and ſave you: then ſhall the eyes of the Blind be lightned, and the eares of the Deaf be opened, and there ſhall be a path, and a way, and it ſhall be called an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, and this ſhall be unto you a direct way, ſo that fools can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre by it.</hi> Thus you order the Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>To this we ſay; 1. Whether it be intended by the Holy Ghoſt to reſpect the Primitive Church, Chriſtian myſtically, through the Jewiſh, we cannot be certain: but ſure we may be, that in the Letter it doth reſpect the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church, after their redemption from captivity. And therefore it may be, you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earing that this ſhould be taken notice of, do wiſely leave out thoſe paſſages, which may ſeem to incline the Text to that ſenſe, and you take only that which you think is for your turn. So you know who would have deceived Chriſt, by omitting that part of Scripture which was againſt him; although you will not allow to the people the Liberty of Scripture, yet let us have all for our life in the diſpute. And it there be a myſtical ſenſe here, yet you know the rule of Divines, which is alſo not denyed by yours, that myſtical Divinity is not argumentative, unleſſe namely the myſtical ſenſe be expreſſed in Scripture, which you are here to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be underſtood of the Primitive Church, through the Jewiſh (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> indeed doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40740:69"/> upon it) yet will it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, unleſſe you can prove, that whatſoever priviledges were promiſed to the firſt Church in the times of the Apoſtles, ſhould in full dimenſions be alwayes extended to your Church, and your Church onely.</p>
            <p>Therefore your <hi>Iſidor Clarius</hi> doth apply this Text to the time of our Saviour, when he did make the Blind to See, the Lame to Walk, as he ſent word to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. And therefore ſince it was ſignally accompliſhed then, we cannot urge the performance of it in that equality in a ſenſe ſpiritual, which alſo ſeems to be acknowledged by Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> upon the place; where the opening of the Ears of the Deaf, he doth apply to the Scripture Preached, and the way he ſaies to be God. Now then, as we cannot ſolidly argue from the promiſe of pouring out the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which was ſolemnly and <hi>ſubf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Peter</hi> declared) that there ſhall be the like effuſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate gifts upon the Church in the following ages, which ſome Sectaries would plead: ſo neither can we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude from this promiſe, which was as that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, and in the Letter perfected by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, that it ſhall be continued to any Church i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that meaſure of a ſpiritual kind. If we cannot evince the ſame perfection in the ſame kinde, ſurely can we not by our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of ſenſe, evince the ſame perfection in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, upon the former conſideration, becauſe it is myſtical, and that not argumentative.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This path, and this way, and this holy way, ſo that fools cannot erre, is (upon ſuppoſition) promiſed to the Church. Is it not? Well then, if it be promiſed to the Church, then the Church is not that way, for that way is promiſed to the Church; ſo that the Church is not abſolutely that way, but ſo far as it goeth that way, which is as much as was ſaid before (and is not yet anſwered) that the Church is <hi>regula regulata,</hi> not <hi>regulans.</hi> Take then the matter thus;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40740:70"/> that way which the Church goes we muſt go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> The Church goes by the way of Gods-Word revealed, and ſo muſt we, therefore we are not bound to follow the Church with blind obedience, which excludes Faith, becauſe that includes Knowledge, although it be contradiſtinguiſhed to Science.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the promiſe did belong to the Church in all times, yet not to any Church of one denomination; therefore untill you can prove that your Church is all, this makes nothing for you. Particular Churches have not thoſe properties which belong to the Univerſal Church as ſuch.</p>
            <p>And if you make a proof of the Church to be the holy way, becauſe the Church is holy, how eaſily is that undone, becauſe there is more reaſon that the Scripture ſhould be the holy way, for that is perfectly holy: or the Holy Ghoſt is the Judge, becauſe he is eſſentially holy, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Church perfectly holy here, nor eſſentially holy not in Heaven: And beſides, ſecondly, the Holy Church (if you underſtand it with relation to the Creed, as in your former Paper) it is to be taken of the Church inviſible, which as ſuch is on way. And thus I have ſlighted your ſtrong hold, as it ſeems to you, for hitherto you do fly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often.</p>
            <p>In your third Number you come to an aſſertion of the neceſſity of an Infallible Judge.</p>
            <p>You ſay that all Chriſtians of whatſoever Religion do agree in this, that there muſt be one Judge of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and Doubts, which either be, or can be in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So you.</p>
            <p>You ſpeak very largely of your ſuppoſition, as if it were agreed to by all Chriſtians, but you do not conſider that you do leave out that which makes the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ſtate of the queſtion; whether there muſt be an Infallible Judge on Earth, for that is not conſented to on all hands, by all Religions, indeed by none but yours.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40740:70"/>
            <p>That God either eſſentially taken, or perſonally the Holy Ghoſt, is the Supreme, Univerſal, Infallible Judge, and onely in whoſe Authority we reſt, and whoſe word is the Ground of Faith, we hold. Under him ſubordinate Judges there are, but not Infallible: neither is it by your reaſon ſufficiently confirmed, that there ſhould be on Earth any Infallible Judge. For the defect of ſuch a Judge on Earth doth not leave us free without any fault to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our own private judgement, in holding what we will. For firſt, it is impoſſible for us to hold what we will, in our judgements. We may poſſibly, though not morally, profeſſe what we will, although contrary to our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as many doe: but we cannot aſſent to what we will, becauſe our Underſtanding is not free to take which part of the oppoſition it pleaſeth by way of Will, for it embraceth. Truth naturally, as it ſees it, and it cannot give a rational aſſent without a due conviction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your implicite Faith is falſe and null.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We do not ſay that we ſhould follow our own judgement of diſcretion, without meanes of regulating our judgement: but yet after we have peruſed the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Councils, and Sentences of the Fathers, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſigne up our Aſſents to their Dictates upon their account, but do examine them, (as the <hi>Beraeans</hi> did that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) untill we can finde them reſolved into the Infallible rule of Holy Scripture. For let me ask a Papiſt, according to the renour of your firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, What doth he believe? he anſwers, that which the Church believeth: and why doth he believe it? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church believeth it: and why doth the Church believe it? becauſe it received it from the firſt Church, through the Sentences of the Fathers, or the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Councils. Well, but how ſhall the People know, whether this Tradition of Doctrine is truly diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and faithfully delivered? but if ſo, why is he bound to believe the firſt Church? becauſe either they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40740:71"/> were the Apoſtles, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had it from the Apoſtles. And why doth he believe the Apoſtles? Becauſe they were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt. Well, in what they wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, or in what they ſpoke, or both: In both. Well, but how do we know what they ſpoke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We know what they wrote bears witneſſe of it ſelf, ſo doth not to us what they ſpoke: ſo that, although they were inſpired in wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they ſpoke, yet we know not what they ſpoke. Neither can we be aſſured by a Divine Faith, that what of them was not written is certainly derived. And therefore all of Faith muſt be terminated, and determined in that which is written.</p>
            <p>And as towards Controverſies, we ſay thirdly, that Chriſt hath ſufficiently provided for the Salvation of Man, in regard of means of knowledge, without an Infallible Judge on Earth of their Controverſies: becauſe things neceſſary are plainly ſet down in Scripture; and for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of queſtion, we are not in any ſuch danger, if we do our endevour according to our condition, to finde out Truth, and do diſpoſe our ſelves to Belief, as we ſhall ſee credibility to ariſe. The Scripture doth with compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent clearneſſe furniſh us againſt damnative error, and the Church doth no more, as you give us to underſtand at the end of this your Treatiſe: and why then ſhould we leave the Scripture (which is acknowledged Infallible) to go to the Church? and what need then of an Infallible Judge? what for Peace and Unity?</p>
            <p>Then fourthly, we ſay that the Deciſions of the Church though unprovided of infallibilitie, do yet oblige unto Peace. Though their judgement cannot ingage undiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſſent: yet their power they have from Chriſt, doth require reverence and undiſturbance in the difference. It requires ſubſcription, if we ſee no cauſe of diſſenting: and if we do, ſubjection to the cenſure. All the authoritie of the world can go no further with us; unleſſe we might be hypocrites in differing by an outward act from our inward
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40740:71"/> act of belief. And yet wherein have we divided out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords from the former General Councils? And therefore why are we charged with this Indictment, as if we were oppoſite to the authoritie of the truly Catholique Church? yet if we did differ without Oppoſition, we keep the peace of the Church without queſtion. And that we muſt differ until we ſee God ſpeaking, believe his reaſon that ſaid, <hi>Omnis creata veritas,</hi> &amp;c. All created veritie is defectible, unleſſe as it is rectified by the increaſed veritie: Wherefore the aſſent neither to the Teſtimonie of Men or Angels doth infallibly lead into Truth, ſave onely ſo far as they ſee the Teſtimonie of God ſpeaking in them. So then the aſſent of Faith is onely under obedience to him ſpeaking. And if you ſay that God doth ſpeak in General Councils, as he doth ſpeak in his Word written, prove it. Yea, how then will you avoyd blaſphemie? For doth God ſpeak Contradictions? For ſo one Council hath contradicted another. And to uſe your own argument, we are bound to ſubmit our judgement onely to thoſe who can judge of the inward act; for ſo you diſtinguiſh betwixt temporal Judges and others; but God only can judge of our internal acts, therefore we muſt ſubmit our aſſents onely to him: and therefore to others, no further then they ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him. So that we cannot abſolutely adhere to whatſoever is ſaid in Councils, which have erred, Jewiſh and Chriſtian too. Now then you may think I ſpoke rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in my reſpects to General Councils without your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited ſubjection of Faith.</p>
            <p>And therefore your admiration in the beginning of the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> page of this Paper, which is grounded upon your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Eſay,</hi> is as unneceſſarie. And that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie which you would infer upon my Opinion (that the wiſeſt men in the world are moſt likely to erre this way by which he may in his interiour judgement go quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to all Chriſtendome) hath little in it out noiſe. For firſt you ſuppoſe hereupon an infallible Judge upon earth;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40740:72"/> which is the Queſtion. Secondly the wiſeſt man is not moſt likely to erre if it be lawful to diſſent from Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal councils, becauſe as ſuch he is moſt apt to diſcern what is defined according to Truth, what not. Thirdly, what think you of Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> who differed in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and profeſſion too, from moſt of Chriſtendome then about the Divinitie of the Sonne. Fourthly, the Rule of Scripture is equally infallible, and thoſe who are wiſe if they prepare themſelves for the ſearch of Truth, they are likely not to erre, (for if they go by the Rule, they cannot erre, becauſe it is infallible: But thoſe who goe by the Church may erre, becauſe for ought is yet proved, it is not infallible) and thoſe who are fools may by Scripture be made wiſe unto ſalvation. And to this purpoſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is very ſublime and heavenly in the matter; yet is ſimple and plain and low in the manner of deliverie, that thoſe who are of meaner capacitie might hereby he ſufficiently directed to life and ſalvation: Therefore doe not tell me but prove to me that the Church is infallible, and that you are the onely Church, or elſe you do nothing but with fooles, whom you find or make to goe your way.</p>
            <p>In your next lines you do diſcharge me of ſingularitie in my Opinion: For it appears by you, that all but <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques are of the ſame perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>All but <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, you ſay. As if none were Catholiques but either of your Nation, or of your Religion. The firſt is a contradiction, and the ſecond is a falſitie; for there were many Catholiques which were not of your Religion in thoſe Points wherein we differ. By the Fathers of the Church, thoſe were accounted Catholiques which withſtood the plea of <hi>Fauſtinus</hi> the Popes Legate in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Council, when he falſified the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon of ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop; whereof no ſuch copie could be found. They were Catholiques who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined againſt Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> who determined equal
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40740:72"/> priviledges of other Churches to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> They were Catholiques who held not Tranſubſtantiation, nor Purgatory, nor your uſe of Images, nor your Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under one kind, nor your other Sacraments, as of proper Name, nor Indulgencies. And they were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, who held that which you doe not hold, as the Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Opinion, and Infant Communion.</p>
            <p>And therefore (to follow you) the deſperate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which you charge us with, if we do not come over to your way, flowes not from your premiſes, unleſſe you can make out an infallible aſſiſtance of your See, and that this is by God appointed for our neceſſarie paſſage to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the way promiſed in the Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi> Nay, if the people ſhould be left, for their guidance to the unanimous conſent of the whole Church in points of Faith, here would be a deſperate conſequence; for I hope they were more like to finde the Articles of Faith in the leaves of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which as to theſe is plain) then in the peruſal and collection of all the judgements of all the Fathers of all ages every where, according to the rule of <hi>Lyrinenſis;</hi> or if we take the depoſitions of the Fathers in thoſe properties, which he deſcribeth ſuch whereby we are to be ruled, that they muſt be holy Men, wiſe Men, they muſt hold the Catholick Faith and Communion, they muſt perſiſt in their Doctrine, they muſt perſiſt in it unto Death in the ſame ſenſe, as in the 39. Chapter againſt Hereſies. If you do not take the conſent of the Church, according to theſe circumſtances you differ from him: If you do, how ſhall the poor people through all thoſe labyrinths, ſee the right way of wholſome Doctrine, when who knows how many of them did not write at all? How many of thoſe who wrote were not ſuch? How many works of thoſe who were ſuch are to us periſhed? How many baſtard pieces are fathered on them? How many of their writings corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? How many or how few have touched upon our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, having not occaſion by adverſaries? How many
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40740:73"/> have differed from one another? How many have differed from themſelves? Is then this the way that fools cannot erre? If wiſe men go this way, ſurely this is their firſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that they go this way; wherein nothing is found but perplexities and unſatisfiedneſſe. Neither can they ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe the credit of their Doctrine by prime deſcent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption from the Apoſtolique age, if all be well conſidered. Such a confidence let me give a check to by application of a ſtorie.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Chriſtian Prince</hi> was much ſeduced by a kind of men, who profeſſed a vaſt Art of giving a certain account of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages before; and a trifling Courtier perceiving his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, made him believe that his Pedegree in antient race of Royal Blood, might be fetched from <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he being greatly delighted, forthwith laid aſide all buſineſſe, and gave himſelf to the ſearch of the thing ſo earneſtly, that he ſuffered none to interrupt him whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; no not Embaſſadours, which were ſent to him about moſt weighty affairs. Many marvelled hereat, but none durſt ſpeak their mind; till at length his Cook, whom he uſed ſometimes as his Fool, told him that the thing he went about was nothing for his honour; for now ſaith he, I worſhip your Majeſtie as a God; but if we go once to <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, we muſt there your ſelf and I both be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinne.</p>
            <p>This the Storie; which is ſo long, that it reacheth you from top to toe: for you would by a verie long ſeries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive your authoritie as it were from <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, which you think repreſents your Church, out of which there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. You would run it up from verie many ſucceſſions to the times of the Apoſtles, and nothing will content you but this ancient Original. You lay aſide all other proofs in compariſon of this ſucceſſion; (not ſo much of Doctrine indeed, as of Church) Embaſſadours that are ſent to you with Scripture you will not hear, unleſſe your Church may have the power of Interpretation infallibly in your
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40740:73"/> own cauſe. But let ſome of the Popes ſervants whom he makes his Fools, inform him that that which he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout is little for his Honour; for now they worſhip <hi>him</hi> as a God, but if they come to the times of the Apoſtles, there will be found no ſuch diſtance betwixt him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and conſanguinitie of Doctrine (as it is expreſſed) will be able to diſinherit your points of difference for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly named, with invocation of Saints <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Where doe we finde them? Where may we read them? Therefore urge not Antiquitie, unleſſe Truth goes along with it on your ſide, and do not any more ſtrain the conſent of ages for Doctrines, which (as we may ſpeak) will be out of breath long before they come to that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie height of the Apoſtolique time.</p>
            <p>As for your inſtance of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> erring by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that which he held to be Scripture, and St. <hi>Auſtins Criſis</hi> of his errour; I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, You ſee here Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Prime Doctor of the Church did then ground his Opinion upon Scripture without recourſe to Tradition. And this makes for us, that he thought it no injurie to the Church to varie from what was held or practiſed upon reſpect to Scripture. He undertook to think and doe otherwiſe then Chriſtendome then, in the point of Rebaptization; and yet was not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as an Heretique.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He erred groſlie, and yet not dangerouſlie, becauſe he held his Opinion without malignance to the Church: and ſo may we without peril of ſalvation. And if you ſay the caſe is different betwixt him and us, becauſe that point wherein he went not with the Church, was not then defined by a Council: We anſwer, what ſhall we ſay then of the times in the Church, before there was any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and therefore in thoſe times the Rule of Faith and Action was without a Council; and therefore this anſwer doth not ſatisfie; or they were ruled only by Scripture, which may ſatisfie you.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:40740:74"/>
            <p>Thirdly, He erred not in the ſubſtance of the Act when he pleaded Scripture; but in the miſapplication of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to that caſe: and therefore this Argument comes to the fallacie of accident, and this makes no prejudice againſt Scripture; which in it ſelf is contrary to errour, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibilitie; and therefore he that indeed follows Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot erre, becauſe it is Infallible. So cannot we ſay of the Church, for ought yet we ſee by your Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This makes no more diſadvantage to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Scripture, then that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> for their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions urged the Teſtimonies of the Fathers: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> to make an Apologie for them, <hi>Vobis Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianis;</hi> when you <hi>Pelagians</hi> were not yet born, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpake more ſecurely; namely of the power of nature. Nay ſurely it makes a great deal leſſe; for the Father, if in this he had followed the Fathers, whom the <hi>Bitagians</hi> quoted, had erred not by his Interpretation of them, but, it ſeems, by their inconfiderateneſſe: But we cannot charge Scripture with any ſuch fault; and therefore Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> erred by miſinterpretation. And here alſo by the way we ſee how fallible a rule is the conſent of the Fathers: ſince if Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> had ordered his belief thereby he had been overtaken with <hi>Pelagianiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as for Saint <hi>Auſtins criſis</hi> concerning this of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that if he had lived to ſee the Determination of a plenary Council, he would for his great humilitie and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſtraightway have yielded, and preferred the General Council before his judgement; to this (beſides what we now ſaid about the undefinedneſſe of it by a Council) we ſay, It is like he would have yielded, and this yet accrews not unto your cauſe much.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes for his great humilitie and charitie he would have yielded. And this manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion you may perceive doth abſtract from a neceſſitie of duty. Under bond of Duty theſe vertues have no freedome. He was ſo humble of mind that he would have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40740:74"/> thought better of them: he was ſo charitable, that for this he would have offended none in this caſe: but doth this infer that he was bound in conſcience to ſink his Opinion in the authoritie of their Definition? No, no. Humilitie and Charitie have in them no formalitie influxive unto Faith (for this is ſeated in the underſtanding) but to peace. Therefore this yielding of his, (ſuppoſed upon the Caſe) would have onely concerned his perſon, as not to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed here; not his judgement, as if this ſhould neceſſarily have been overcome by their Authority. For the perſon may be bound when the Conſcience cannot be bound: ſo may the perſon yield as to the omiſſion of oppoſite acts, when the underſtanding yet keeps its former due appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this buſineſſe of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> is ſuch as is a matter of practice not clearly decided by Scripture: but this avails not to an univerſal concluſion of ruling our faith by the Church; which although you at the beginning did ſeem to wave, yet here would in your diſcourſe inſinuate and wind in. The ſumme of this is, We do not diſpute a reverence to Councils: but we cannot grant an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted reception of whatſoever is delivered by them. In ſuch determination we break not the peace; but keep Faith for Gods Word. So then your fourth Number in your ſixt page might have been ſpared, until you had upheld your ſuppoſition of conſtruing that of <hi>Eſay</hi> to be meant of the Church. All you build thereupon muſt be ruinous. <hi>Debile fundamentum fallit opus.</hi> And beſides what is there but repetitions? Onely you obſerve therein another inconvenience in our Cauſe; in that we doe not hold one Infallible Judge on earth, which yet in effect you have had before. But to view the moment thereof the better, let me put what you would have into ſome form with all ingenuitie; thus, where there is not one Judge there will not be one Faith: but there is one Faith; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is but one Judge.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:40740:75"/>
            <p>Now if you will accept this: Syllogiſm for yeare, I ſhall anſwer to it by diſtinguiſhing; if you mean in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition an Infallible Judge on Earth, and ſuch a Faith as is to be underſtood in the aſſumption according to the Text, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5, then we deny the propoſition; for Faith there, is not to be underſtood of Faith ſubjectively, but Faith objectively; and Faith, in regard of the objects thereof may be entire, and one, though every one doth not hold them, for the unity of Faith there depends not upon mens profeſſion, but upon coherence with it ſelfe, and the excluſion of any other, as towards appointment unto Salvation. If you mean Faith otherwiſe, we deny your aſſumption to be true to the ſenſe of the Text.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay then, that otherwiſe God had not well provided for the Salvation of men generally, if but one of ten thouſands (without an Infallible Judge) might hit the right ſenſe of Scripture: We Anſwer, Firſt, you ſee here how your opinion doth miſerably betray you to hard thoughts of Scripture, and conſequently of God in it. Is not Scripture able to make us wiſe unto Salvation? Is it not given by inſpiration? Is it not profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for Conviction, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſſe; that the man of God might be abſolute, being made perfect unto every good work? as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. what can we deſire more of Scripture in regard of ſufficiency to its end, then that it ſhould be <hi>able to make us wiſe unto Salvation?</hi> what can we want in it, as in regard of the matter of it towards that end, when as it is profitable as to thoſe purpoſes? and if there be not all ſo clear, as that every one of the people may diſcerne the minde of God as towards a particular ſenſe; yet the Man of God, the Miniſter of the Goſpel by the Study and Learning he hath, may be able to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by furniſhed to every good work, that he may inſtruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now I think you will not think that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by the Man of God here intended the Pope, or any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40740:75"/> Judge, and therefore your poſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gre or an Infallible Judge is unreaſonable. Any Miniſter of the Goſpel, by his abilities, is able competently, through the Scripture, to direct the people unto their happineſſe; and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was inſpired to this purpoſe, as it appears. And what need then of an Infallible Judge? It is true, every Miniſter is not able to explicate all difficulties of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, no nor all your Popes and Councels neither, but in things neceſſary their knowledge may be ſufficient; in points of debate, there is no neceſſity of certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as unto Salvation. And this you afterward come to, when you take care to ſave the credit of the Church by a diſtinction, that it cannot teach any damnative error, ſo then it may erre, but not teach damnative error. The Scripture teacheth all things neceſſary; cannot erre at all; why then do we not reſt here? Therefore take you no more this way of reckoning, we have an Infallible Judge therefore we muſt abſolutely hear him. But firſt, prove the neceſſity of a Judge indefinitly, and then who it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively, and then we have done. In the mean time, you are in the perill of Treaſon, not againſt Gods Judge, but againſt God the Judge, in ſetting up another Judge, in the Conſciences of men. And if the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Judge, who is not Infallible, goes without a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and makes Lawes himſelfe, is not this Treaſon? So then, the ſubordinate Judge determines by Scripture or not; if not, then he makes a new Law: if he doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by Scripture, then doth his determination bind by Authority of Scripture, where of he is but a Miniſter. And is not the Word by the Spirit of God Judicative? What elſe is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. Conſider well that Text, and ſee if it may not anſwer all your objections againſt Scripture? If you ſay the Word of God is a Dead Letter, it cannot ſpeak; it is here denyed, it is Living: if you ſay that it cannot act; it is denyed, it is active, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> if you ſay that cannot decide Controverſies; what is ſaid here? <hi>It is ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40740:76"/> then any two edged Sword.</hi> It decides all Controverſies of Faith, and thoſe points of Faith (pretended) which are not, here it doth cut off. If you ſay that cannot reach the Conſcience, what then can? it is piercing, even to the dividing of Soul and Spirit, Joynts and Marrow. If you ſay it cannot judge, it is here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Critical, exactly Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative of the thoughts and notions of the heart; and this is more then any Judge on Earth can do. All that Judges on Earth can do, in our queſtion, is but to declare and apply the deciſions of Scripture againſt Error or Evil practice: if they go higher, they go above their Sphere. And ſince they may (for ought appears by you to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) miſſe of the right determination, we uſe them but as Conſuls, not as dictators: We conſult them, and then look to the Rule. What then it is to ſubmit your interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Judgement (as you ſpeak) to any one on Earth, I leave it to you to judge; ſince he, whoſoever he is, can oblige aſſent no otherwiſe now then by light of Scripture, which is the ſtanding and onely rule we have to go by unto happineſs. And if we go any other way to ſettle our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of truth (which is to be preferred before unity) we ſhall come no way to faith. So you ſee what is the cauſe of the chaſm betwixt us; you cannot come to us, becauſe you are bound and captivated by your Infallibility, which while you hold, it holds you in incapacity of being better advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and we cannot come to you, becauſe you hold it. It is hard to ſay which hath deſtroyed more Souls, uncertainty of that Religion which we have in Scripture, or Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beſides it; and yet not ſo hard, for Uncertainty may be helped, but Infallibility hath no remedy.</p>
            <p>And now, foraſmuch as you have not upon firm ground eſtabliſhed the neceſſarineſſe of an Infallible Judge, I need go no further, till this be made ſure. I need not have any thing to do with your aſſumption; indeed, (if I may be ſo free) a preſumption. Yet, leſt you ſhould take it amiſſe or ill, if I ſhould ſay nothing to it by it ſelfe,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40740:76"/> I ſhall not let it paſſe without ſome notice of it.</p>
            <p>But what you ſay at firſt here, that if we finde out this Judge, we can never remain in any doubt; for without all doubt, we muſt ſtand to the judgement of this Judge, what reaſons ſoever our private judgement or diſcretion may ſuggeſt: So you; this ſpoyles all, and this is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt you: that which you ſay is little elſe then <hi>Contradictio in adjecto,</hi> as they ſpeak. If we muſt ſubmit our judgements to an Infallible Judge (pretended) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reaſons (of Scripture I mean) we have to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, then there is no ſuch Judge; for it is impoſſible for us in our judgements to aſſent to that, for which we ſee reaſons of Scripture to the contrary. Take Reaſon ſimply, and ſo in matters of Faith it muſt <hi>quieſcere</hi> (as the School phraſe is) as a principle, becauſe the doctrine of Faith is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, in the judgement of <hi>Aquinat,</hi> at the beginning of his Summs: but take Reaſon as an Inſtrument for the finding out of the ſenſe of Scripture; and ſo, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we finde in Scripture for any opinion, we cannot ſink in any determinations on Earth. As far as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſees appearance of Truth, it doth neceſſarily leap and run to it, and will not leave it for any Authority under Heaven: and therefore, while the reaſon of Authority is not ſo clearly drawn from the Word of God, as the reaſon of his Opinion in his own judgement, it cannot give up its aſſent. And if we are by duty to go your way of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute credence to the dictates of your Judge, we muſt then, if he ſaies Vices are Vertues, ſay ſo too, as your Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> determins, in his 4. Book, <hi>de Rom. Pontif. cap.</hi> 5. And thus you again ſee whither your blind obedience will lead you, even from darkneſſe to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh Number you lay to our charge an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all Hereticks that have riſen up againſt the Church, becauſe we (as all Proteſtants) do hold that the Scripture is the onely Judge, by which all doubts
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40740:77"/> and differences and Controverſies of Religion, are to be determined with Infallible Authority. To this Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwers, <hi>l. de Trinit. cap.</hi> 38.</p>
            <p>We alſo anſwer to this charge, firſt, as before, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks have urged Authority too, and therefore by your argument, you muſt quit your way of the Authority of the Church, or elſe grant us our way of Scripture notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Secondly, doth it follow rationally, that becauſe the Hereticks have miſapplyed Scripture, therefore we ſhould not rightly apply it? If the Standard be made uſe of to ill purpoſe, of meaſuring ſtoln commodities, therefore ſhall not other meaſures be ruled hereby? It is accidental to Scripture to be thus abuſed: ſhall it therefore looſe its proper priviledge? becauſe, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, ſome who are unlearned and unſetled wreſt Scriptures to their deſtruction; therefore thoſe who are learned and ſetled may not improve it to their Salvation: becauſe Robbers make uſe of the light of the Sun, for actions unrighteous and wicked; therefore honeſt men may not uſe the Light for their lawful imployments. Is this good reaſoning? You had ſurely raiſed your diſcourſe to the height, if you had told us that we muſt not urge Scripture, becauſe the Devil did urge it unto our Saviour Chriſt. So one indeed concludes: as if the Devil did not apprehend what kinde of argument our Saviour would own, and what reject, therefore did he not ſet upon him with Tradition of the Church, as is noted. Neither did Chriſt reply upon him with Tradition, but with Scripture, which is a better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that this is to be our Rule which we ſhould be be ordered by. Thirdly, The Hereticks did not preſſe that which was true Scripture, but either corrupted it, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves in his praeſcriptions; or took onely ſo much as was for their uſe, or perverted the ſenſe of it; ſo that if Scripture doth conſiſt in the ſenſe, they did not bring Scripture for their proof, but that which is not Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Fourthly, Why doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40740:77"/> your Writers ſo frequently endevour to uphold their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines by Scripture, if becauſe the Hereticks uſe it, we muſt not? Neither do they plead Scripture by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſenſe of the Church, but by their own Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When Scripture ſeems to them to ſpeak for them, then they produce Scripture; but when they are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with clear teſtimonies againſt them, then little reſpect is given thereunto. Fifthly, If Controverſies are not to be ended by Scripture, which the Hereticks plead, then how are they to be ended by the judgement of the Church? Yes, you will ſay, but how ſhall Hereticks know, if they doubt what or which is the true Church? it muſt be by the Scripture, ſo that our laſt recourſe muſt be to Scripture. Again, if Hereticks muſt be perſwaded by the Church, then are they led, if not by their private judgements, yet by private judgements of others. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Church conſiſts of private Men, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole, if they could be certain of it, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Scripture, in way of contradiſtinction, hath it ſelf by manner of private judgement: All the publick power it hath, it hath by God and Scripture: then here again we muſt end. Again, how ſhall Hereticks know that all Controverſies are to be ended by the Church? they muſt know it either by their own judgements of diſcretion, which you deny to us, or by the Church. What in its own cauſe? or by Scripture? ſo we muſt reſolve our ſelves in Scripture, analytically we muſt bottome there, ſynthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically we muſt begin there. Sixthly, This practice of Hereticks, if it hath reaſon to make us forſake Scripture, hath it not reaſon alſo to make you retract your expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your ſelf as towards Scripture, that you do profeſſe all reverence and all credit to be due to Scripture, as the Infallible word of God, inſomuch that you are ready to give your lives in defence of any thing conteined herein? Will you ſtand to your words? If you will, then muſt you believe, that whatſoever is neceſſary is declared therein
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40740:78"/> ſufficiently, For what ſaith the Scripture by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1.8. <hi>If I, or an Angel from Heaven preach to you any other. Doctrine beſides what you have received, let him be Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.</hi> And what then becomes of your unwritten word, on behalf whereof you wiſely cry up the infallibility of the Church, in points of Religion? For as for the diſtinction of your men hereupon, that the Text is to be underſtood of that which is againſt it, not of that which is beſide it, is invalid, for it is in the Text beſide, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and beſides, that which is beſide it as a Rule, is againſt it: For if any thing be a Rule beſides it, then is that not a Rule. For a Rule or Canon, as it excludes defect, ſo doth it exclude exceſs, and therefore, in neceſſaries to faith and ſalvation nothing is to be added; as in the 22. of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> the 18. <hi>If any man ſhall adde hereunto, God ſhall adde unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book.</hi> After the conſignation of the Canon, nothing is to be added as he ſaid.</p>
            <p>And your glorious aſſerting (which follows in your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe) that you onely do truly believe the Scripture, becauſe you onely believe it to be the Word of God upon Divine Revelation manifeſted by Gods Church, which (as you will ſhew) is infallible, is certainly not very ſound: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe firſt, this is not yet put out of queſtion that the Church is infallible. This you would beg and have to be granted unto you: therefore you paſſe the proof of it here, and skip from this to the denial of true faith to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. For this Demonſtration we muſt wait your leiſure. Secondly, we deny unto you any reaſon of this your glory in the belief of Scripture, upon this conſideration; that the Faith of Proteſtants is more grounded then yours is: for whatſoever authority the Church hath towards this perſwaſion we alſo make uſe of as a motive to this Faith: and then we do reſolve and ſettle and determine our Faith hereof by the <hi>autopiſtie</hi> of the word of God, which you ſay is the infallible Word of God. If it be infallible, it cannot deceive us. Neither can be it be ſaid that we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40740:78"/> cannot be aſſured of its infallibility by its ſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot be aſſured of the Authority of the Church, but by the Word of God. Yea, this is the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of Divine Faith, to believe what he ſaith to be true, becauſe he ſaith it: Therefore muſt we believe that the Scripture is the Word of God, becauſe he ſaith it. And ſuppoſe the Church were Infallible, yet muſt we ground and terminate our Faith hereof in Scripture, unleſſe it did otherwiſe appear Infallibly to be ſo, or elſe we are in everlaſting motion to and fro: as, Why do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture to be the VVord of God? becauſe the Church ſaith it. VVhy do I believe the Church? becauſe the Scripture beareth witneſſe of it. How do I know the Scripture ſaith it? becauſe, again the Church ſaith ſo. You muſt then come to us and our principles, if you will have any grounded conſtitution of Divine Faith: we flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate, and hover up and down like the Dove, untill we come to ſet a ſure foot on the ground of Scripture. The prime and indemonſtrable principle of all Divinity, amongſt principles complexe, muſt be this, that the Scripture is the VVord of God.</p>
            <p>And hereupon, that which you ſay in your eighth page, That it is no where written in Scripture, that ſuch and ſuch Books of Scripture be Canonical, and the undoubted VVord of God, &amp;c. makes no prejudice againſt us (and yet that which is quoted in Scripture from any other book, under ſuch a name, is upon this conſideration Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical) for they are worthy to be believed for themſelves. As we aſſent unto prime principles, in the habit of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, by their own light: ſo do we aſſent unto Scripture, to be the VVord of God; through the help of the Spirit of God, do we ſee the Scripture to be the VVord of God, as by its own light. Therefore hath Faith more propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Intelligence, then to Science, ſince we ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, but by the credibility of the object which hath upon it impreſſed the Authority of God. And this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40740:79"/> in effect, even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did ſee in his Rhetoricks, when he ſpeaks of that which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is either by Humane Teſtimony or by Divine; in the latter whereof, that which makes the Faith, is the Teſtimony of God. And that teſtimony of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which your <hi>Bellarmin</hi> produceth againſt thoſe who were for private Revelations, beſide Scripture, in his firſt Book, <hi>De verbo Dei, cap.</hi> 2. (and he takes it out of the 12 of his <hi>De Civit. cap.</hi> 9.) infers as much in theſe words, <hi>Scripturae fides mirabilem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritatem non immeritò habet,</hi> &amp;c. The Faith of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, hath not undeſervedly an admirable Authority in the Chriſtian VVorld, and in all Nations, which, amongſt other things that it ſpoke, it did by a true Divinity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell would believe it. It hath an admirable Authority, not undeſervedly; mark that, not from the Chriſtian world, but in the Chriſtian world, and in all Nations which it did foretell would believe it; not the Church, for they that were the Church were to believe it firſt: it did foretell by a true Divinity: if then we would uſe a ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical argument, and intrinſecal from the Scripture, it, ſhould be this, that what it hath foretold, is come certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to paſſe; and what is come to paſſe, in the belief of it it did foretell. The humane Faith then, ſuch as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we believe <hi>Cicero</hi>'s or <hi>Virgils</hi> books, is indeed yours; for you are they who have no other then humane grounds, and conſequently an humane Faith, if your Faith doth reſt upon the authority of Man. VVhat you have more to ſay to this, out of the virtue of General Councils, you refer me to in the 19 Number; but all the light they give comes from the Sanctuary of Scripture, and therefore what Light you have, muſt be more then Mans.</p>
            <p>In the middle of your eighth page, you ſay you have a ſecond convincing Argument: it is eaſily denyed to be a ſecond convincing Argument, for it cannot be a ſecond convincing Argument, untill the firſt proves ſo.</p>
            <p>But the ſumme of this Argument is drawn from our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40740:79"/> of the knowledge of the Scripture to be the VVord of God by our tranſlations, ſince the Scriptures were written in Ebrew and Greek, which one of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand doth not perfectly underſtand. But do you not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this Argument will rebound with more force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, for you have nothing at all for your belief, but the Authority of the Church in your Tranſlation Latin. Yea, the people muſt have no knowledge at all by any Tranſlation which they underſtand, therefore their Faith upon this account is leſſe Divine, becauſe they have no underſtanding of Scripture by any Interpretation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Tranſlations are the VVord of God not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but ſo far as they agree with the Originals, and therefore by them we do not ground our Faith as ſuch: but we ground our Faith upon that which is tranſlated to be the VVord of God, becauſe God by his Spirit perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us of it, therefore the Fallibility of Tranſlation doth not deſtroy our Faith, for we do not build it upon a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but this you do, you rely upon your Latin Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,<note place="margin">Seſſion the 4. as <hi>Bel.</hi> in the 30. B. <hi>De verbo Dei,</hi> c. 9.</note> which by the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel was Chriſtened Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique before it was born. You make that to be the Scripture, by which you muſt decide Controverſies; (then you decide Controverſies by Scripture.) And hath that no faults in it? Is it every word Infallibly done? If Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly done at firſt, why did <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth vary from <hi>Sixtus quintus?</hi> and why doth <hi>Iſidor Clarius</hi> vary from him in thouſands of places? And do you any where find in Scripture, that this Interpretation is made Canonical? And are there none that find great fault with this Latin one? If you will look into your <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his third Book, <hi>De verbo Dei,</hi> 10. Chapter you may finde the contrary; and although it goes under the account of an antient Edition and <hi>Hieronis,</hi> yet in the Chapter before, you may ſee he findes adverſary objections, and you may find by his confeſſion that all is not his. VVhat need then <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> have made it up? And is not your
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40740:80"/> Rhemiſh Teſtament very faultie? Will you, undertake to make it all good againſt <hi>Fulk?</hi> And if you ſay that you may be certain of your Latin by the Church which you will prove to be infallible; until you do prove it, you doe again commit the fallacie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This ſhould have been made irrefragably ſure at firſt by <hi>Achillean</hi> invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, and then we ſhould have fallen down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. But again you tell us you will do it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fly at us for our Opinion. Is there not one of yours who is prettily, in his Oppoſition againſt Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> about the Popes temporal power, compared to the <hi>pulex,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In ſome lines following of your Treatiſe we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but petitions or repetitions, and we anſwer no more till you prove more, then this, no man ever erred by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Scripture ſincerely which you grant to be the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Word of God: If they erred, they erred from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not by it. But fools may be made wiſe by Scripture, and wiſe men may erre by your Church, until you make it infallible. <hi>Nullibi pronior fidei lapſus quam ubi rei falſae gravis autor extitit,</hi> as he ſaid. If they may teach that which is falſe, wiſe men may alſo be deceived; if they be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, they may teach that which is falſe.</p>
            <p>But in the eighth line of the ninth page you oppoſe to me Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> authoritie, and of all the greateſt Doctors which ever the Church had, that they profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unable to underſtand the Scriptures, and that after many years ſtudy, and how then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We eaſily anſwer, Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth not ſay that the Scripture is abſolutely and univerſally, in all places ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, that we may not get out from thence that which will
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40740:80"/> direct us to Heaven, for then he ſhould contradict himſelf. Doth he not ſay in his 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> chapter of the 2. Book <hi>Dê Doct. Chriſt.</hi> That there are ſome things indeed difficult; but the obſcurity is profitable to tame our pride by labour, and to bring back our underſtanding from loathing, <hi>cui facile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigata plerumque vileſcum,</hi> as he ſaith. And fully again in in his 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Tome, <hi>De verbis Apoſtoli, Serm.</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>Verbi Dei altitudo,</hi> &amp;c. The ſublimitie of the Word of God doth exerciſe our ſtudy, doth not deny to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. If all were ſhut up, there would be nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that which is obſcure would be revealed. Again, if all were covered, there would not be from whence the ſoul ſhould receive nouriſhment, and might have ſtrength to knock at that which is ſhut. Therefore your fallacie is <hi>à di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto ſecundum quid,</hi> if from hence, you would conclude all to be difficult: yea ſo, you would contradict Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaith of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, <hi>that ſomethings of them are hard to be underſtood,</hi> not all; <hi>Exceptio in non exceptis fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat regulam,</hi> as the Rule is. Yea, you would contradict your ſelf, who ſay more then once, that thoſe things which are plain in Scripture, you believe by the authority of Scripture. But if from the aſſerting of ſome things diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, you would onely conclude that this cannot be the judge in Controverſies, as you ſeem to intend in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; we ſay plainly, this difficulty in ſome things of Scripture doth not inferre the neceſſity of an infallible Judge on earth, your premiſſes do not conclude this, and we allow unto you the uſe of Judges on earth, although they be not infallible. As Judges in civil Cauſes may and do ſometimes erre, yet is there uſe of them; ſo alſo is there of Eccleſiaſtical Judges, though not incapable of errour: and again, there is no peril of damnation on either ſide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly held in points of Queſtion; and therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yet may be the way ſo direct that fools cannot erre in matters of neceſſary faith and practice. And fourthly, a General Council is the higheſt you can goe in humane
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40740:81"/> Authoritie, and yet this doth not binde unto Faith, becauſe it is not free from errour. To which purpoſe believe Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> if you will ſtand to his judgement, in his third book againſt <hi>Maximinus</hi> Biſh of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the fourteenth chapter, <hi>Sed nunc nac ego Nicenum,</hi> &amp;c. But now neither ought I produce the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, nor you that of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> as boaſting thereof: neither am. I held under the authority of this, nor you of the other. Let matter with matter, cauſe with cauſe, reaſon with reaſon, be debated by Authorities of Scriptures, not proper witneſſes to any, but common to both. So he. Where you ſee he prefers the authorities of Scripture before Councils; which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not infallible even here, becauſe one was for the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Here is Council againſt Council, as there hath been Pope againſt Pope. In this caſe what will you do? which muſt you ſubmit to? Is one infallible contrary to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallible? If you muſt ſubmit to both, you ſubmit to errour, if to one, why not to the other if that be infallible. And this alſo will include uncertainty of all humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions about the Canon of Scripture, which hath been ſpoken to before.</p>
            <p>We come now to your ſecond Reaſon in your eighth Number.</p>
            <p>That you ſay comes into this Enthymene. Many Controverſies there are, and may be yet very many more moſt neerly concerning the neceſſary means to ſalvation which can never be ended, and undoubtedly decided by judgement and ſentence of the Scriptures; therefore the Scripture is not the Judge.</p>
            <p>We anſwer to the Antecedent, in thoſe termes I deny it in both the branches, if you mean, by thoſe things nearly concerning the neceſſary means to ſalvation, ſuch things as are indeed neceſſary to ſalvation; otherwiſe you go upon a falſe ſuppoſition that there is a neceſſitie of a Judge on earth, undoubtedly to decide that which is not neceſſarie: Therefore chuſe you which you will hold to; if you mean
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40740:81"/> thoſe following inſtances to be of the neceſſaries, I deny the antecedent in both branches; if not, I deny your ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Taking you in the former ſence, I ſay that there are not now many Controverſies neceſſary to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto ſalvation, which may not undoubtedly be decided by Scripture: and alſo I ſay there may not be yet many more. The firſt branch I deny, becauſe though many things which are <hi>res queſtionis,</hi> are not decided by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet many controverſies in things neceſſary cannot be ſaid not to be undoubtedly decided by Scripture, becauſe in things neceſſary there are not many Controverſies. And the ſecond branch I denie, becauſe we cannot expect any new neceſſaries, and a new Tradition is a certain contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Now to anſwer to your particulars for the proof of the antecedent. Controverſie may be moved (you ſay) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the lawfulneſs of working and not working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdayes and Sundayes. How will this Controverſie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So you.</p>
            <p>To which we return you this anſwer, that there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in Scripture to ground the practice of the Church for the obſerving of the Lords day. Firſt by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Equity of keeping one day in ſeven, which wee have in the fourth Commandement. There is in the Commandment <hi>morale naturae,</hi> that there ſhould be a time ſet a part for publicke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and this by the Light of Nature the Heathens did ſee; as <hi>Tully, Non ut Conſilii ſic Sacrificii, &amp;c.</hi> There is not a day appointed of Counſel, as of ſacrifice; then there is a poſitive determination to the Jew of the ſeventh day, to be the day in the week of their ſolemn ſervice; and to this is agreable by good analogle, that Chriſtians ſhould keep one day in ſeven as well as the Jews. Now the moments in Scripture for the Tranſlation of the day are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, the appellation of the Lords day, moſt likely of the day we keep, the meeting of the Diſciples and breaking of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40740:82"/> bread on the firſt day of the week; the order for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the poor by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> To theſe we add the <hi>Syriack</hi> Interpretation, which in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the 11. Chapter and the 20. Verſe, expreſſeth it thus; when therefore you meet, you do not, as it is juſt on the Lords Day, eating and drinking, which is to be underſtood of the Communion, according to the ſcope of the place. And therefore may we think that this point of practiſe was ſo competently ſet out in Scripture, as that we cannot ſuſpend the uſage upon the Authoritie of the Church, ſince we may conceive that the Church was bound by the former Conſiderations to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Day of Chriſts Reſurrection, which is the Hope of the new Creature. The ſeventh Day to the Jew was Poſitive and Ceremonial; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon that account, under capacity of being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: and the Equity of one day in the week is now under practice upon the former intimations. Secondly, If the Jewiſh day ceaſeth not in the Obligation to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, then the time when Chriſtians ſhould keep, is under the Divine Commandement, and is none of thoſe things wherein the Church hath power; becauſe as you will confeſſe, it hath no authority to reſcinde a Divine precept. So then, if by neceſſity of mean it is neceſſary to keep the Lords day, it is lawfully done and upon duty; if it be not neceſſary by neceſſity of mean, then is this Example of yours impertinent. And ſo this argument (unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as you eſteem it) is without much labour anſwered by thoſe who make the Scripture, in which God ſpeaks, by him the ſole Infallible Judge; not excluding ſubordinate Judges; which are to regulate their deciſions by the rule of the word, unto which the Scripture is not ſilent: and in other things no need to be ſure of ſuch a Judge as you would have.</p>
            <p>And this ſecond Anſwer to your firſt inſtance, may be available for your ſatisfaction in your ſecond inſtance from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40740:82"/> the 15. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> For if thoſe precepts of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in that Council, do binde all alwaies, then is We matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Scripture: if they do not, then are we at our Chriſtian liberty from them, without a formal diſcharge thereof from the Church. And ſecondly, that we are not held under obedience to thoſe Lawes, appears by the intention of their impoſition for that time: ſince, they were impoſed upon occaſion of ſcandal to the weak Jew; the reaſon whereof now ceaſeth, and therefore the Laws; <hi>ubi ratio ceſſat lex ceſſat,</hi> as the rule is. Onely as the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Laws binde, yet <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad genus</hi> as they ſpeak, that there ſhould be a decent publick worſhip in the Church of God, not <hi>quoad ſpeciem,</hi> that we ſhould continue the uſe of the ſame Ceremonies: ſo even theſe precepts which were in their nature Ceremonial, do yet binde ſo far impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of kinde, that in things of indifferency we ſhould have reſpect to our weak Brother. Thirdly, Neither can you ſay, that either he that does abſtain from thoſe things forbidden, or he that does not abſtain, is upon that account in danger of damnation. And therefore as <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> we diſtinguiſh of your term Neceſſary; if you take this matter Neceſſary as abſolutely ſo by the morality of it, or perpetual by appointment, then we deny it to be neceſſary ſo, and why do not you keep, them? if onely neceſſary as to preſent practice; then doth it not come up to our queſtion: for it is none of thoſe things neceſſary to Salvation, which are determinable by the Church, and not by Scripture.</p>
            <p>In your tenth Number you give us another caſe not umpired by Scripture, whether the King is Head of the Church. And this, you ſay, we thought once to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Scripture affirmatively: now not; ſo you in effect: this point is now no longer aſcertained us by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible judgement of Scripture, ſo you in terms. We anſwer. Firſt, What is infallibly decided in Scripture, will ever be ſo, although we do not alwaies finde it; but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40740:83"/> we cannot find any thing infallibly decided by the Church. Secondly, We do not ſay that every point is Infallibly decided in Scripture, becauſe it is not at all decided, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you mean us ſo, you miſtake us. And now, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing theſe conſiderations; we anſwer, that we do hold our principle ſtill, if you will underſtand as according to our mind. Head of the Church as you hold the Pope to be Head of the Church, ſo as that we are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as upon his Infallibility, to be ruled by his dictates, in matters of Religion, we never held the King to be: but to be Head of the Church, ſo as to be the chief Governor thereof, as being appointed by God to be the Keeper of both Tables, ſo we hold him to be ſtill. This diſtinction makes an end, as it may ſeem, of your objection; and yet ſecondly, we do not pretend the King to be head of the Univerſal Church, as you pretend the Pope to be head of the Univerſal Church: and therefore are they not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>ad idem.</hi> Thirdly, Is it determined in Scripture, whether the Pope be Head of the Church or not. You ſay it is, for if you ſay it is not, you are all loſt. Well, if it be determined by Scripture, then conſequently it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in Scripture that the King is not: and ſo this your Controverſie is one of thoſe, which is decided and concluded negatively, in or by Scripture. So this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt us doth not thrive.</p>
            <p>Another point of this kind you make, in your eleventh Number, about the Canon of Scripture, your Argument ſeems to be thus, that we ſhould know the Canon is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: we do not know it by Scripture, therefore by the Church. Is it not thus? you cannot make your matter ſhorter without any detriment to you. And therefore we anſwer; firſt, as at firſt (which you give us the occaſion to put you in mind of) that if the Church were Infallible Judge of all Canonical books, yet would it not follow from hence, that it ſhould be Infallible Judge in all points of Faith, and Manners (which you would fain have, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40740:83"/> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſeful for you) unleſſe ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ally, for we might ſuppoſe more aſſiſtance to the Church in this particular, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes: ſince alſo, when that is made ſure, that there are the books of Scripture, we ſhould look for no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for Life and Salvation but this. Therefore, if you argue, that becauſe it is Judge Infallible of Canonical books, it is Judge of all matters, you do not rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a particular. You are in that which is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore you do not conclude in your firſt Univerſality. Secondly, We are not to be aſſured by Divine Faith, that there are Canonical books, from the authority of the Church, and therefore is not the Church the Infallible Judge herein. We muſt beleeve them to be Canonical by their own Authority, otherwiſe we ſhall never believe them to be ſo: ſo that you ſee, we deny the Aſſumption, and we ſay we may know the Canonical books by Scripture, we have no other Divine Authority to know them by. They bear witneſſe of themſelves, they carry their own light, which we may ſee them by, as we ſee the Sun by its own light. For, let me put you to this Dilemma, either the Scripture is to be believed for it ſelf, or the Church is to be believed for it ſelf. If the Scripture be to be believed for it ſelf, then have we our cauſe; if the Church be to be believed for it ſelf, then muſt we know this by a Revelation beſide Scripture, which your <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſputes againſt, in the beginning of his Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and whether that Revelation be not Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and more uncertain then the word of God; judge you.

               </gap> that the Scripture ſhould be believed in its own cauſe, then the Church? but if you ſay that the Authority of the Church is evidenced by Scripture concerning it; then that is to be believed for itſelf as towards the Church, and why not then other parts of it? Thirdly, If the Church be the Judge Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible of Canonical books, how came Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Church in the debate about Books Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40740:84"/> as you know and may ſee by your <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his ſecond Book, <hi>De verbo Dei, cap.</hi> 9. amongſt which Apocryphal books the <hi>Maccabees</hi> are numbred to be by him accounted ſuch, and therefore Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> did not in his Latin Edition tranſlate them; and then let S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s authority juſtifie <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther</hi> upon your principles: for you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the <hi>Maccabees</hi> to be as well Canonical, as you and we do the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> That the Scripture is ſilent of its own Canon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we cannot prove a book to be infallibly Canonical by it ſelf without begging the queſtion, hath litle of iudiciouſneſs in it; for how do we ſee light? how do we prove firſt and indemonſtrable principles? how do we prove that, which we apprehend by natural light? after this manner is the underſtanding irradiated to ſee the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture in it and by it, well, and how do we prove the Church to be infallible by it, without begging the queſtion? therefore you muſt come about to Scripture. And again, if you prove the Church to be infallible Judge herein, becauſe the Scripture is not, you beg the queſtion who are to diſpute; not I, who am to anſwer.</p>
            <p>Your twelfth number goes upon a falſe ſuppoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt in part of it; namely, that we are bound to believe that the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was written by him, as alſo the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> to be written by St. <hi>Mark.</hi> We deny it. We are bound indeed to believe that the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> as we diſtinguiſh them, are the word of God; but we are not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they were written by them. It is no part or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my faith to believe the Penman of any part of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſave onely ſo far as it is declared in the body of Scripture, for it is not Scripture becauſe Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote it: but Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote it, as being inſpired that it was the word of God, in the matter of it. If then your diſcourſe goes upon the matter of it, it was anſwered before: if upon the title, it is not allowed to be <hi>de fide</hi> or any point of faith, that ſuch was writer of any piece of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40740:84"/> Scripture. And whereas you urge that ſome have denied this Goſpel, and ſome or other have denied other books to be Canonical, how then ſhall we end this Controverſie or others about the Canon by Scripture; I anſwer. And do not Hereticks deny your Church to be infallible? will you therefore quit your opinion? So then either this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not good againſt us, or it is alſo good againſt you. Secondly, If Hereticks reject ſome books, we may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the authority of the Catholick Church to our faith of them by their own authority. And this ſeems to be as much as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> would have us to attribute to the Church in this particular, as we have his advice in his ſecond Book <hi>de Doctrinâ Chriſtianâ cap.</hi> 8. where he ſays, <hi>in Canonicis autem Scripturis Eccleſiarum Catholicarum quam-plurimum ſequatur authoritatem,</hi> In Canonical Scriptures let him very much follow the authority of the Catholick Churches; amonſt which ſurely theſe are they which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited (if you will conſtrue it ſo) to have Apoſtolick ſeats, and to receive (Apoſtolick) Epiſtles. Obſerve that he ſaith, let him follow the authoritie very much, which doth not conclude that we ſhould wholly rely upon it, and of the Catholick Churches in the plural; not one only. Then there are more Catholick Churches in his judgement, and ſuch are they which merited to have Apoſtolick Seas, and Epiſtles; then your Church onely is not to be called the Apoſtolique Sea. And whereas afterward in this Church he doth reckon <hi>Apocryphall</hi> Books, yet is it to be noted, that herein he followed the authoritie of the Churches; Notwithſtanding which, Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> as before, did not receive them; which makes a ſufficient reaſon to hold that the authority of the Churches is not a ſufficient ground of faith in the belief of Canonical Books, or elſe St. <hi>Jerome</hi> (who in this may be compared with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for his judgement) is in the ſame condemnation with us.</p>
            <p>Afterwards you plead, that ſince the Goſpel of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> was written in Hebrew, whereof there is not extant
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40740:85"/> any one Copy in the world, and it is not certain who or how faithfully he did tranſlate it, we cannot be certain by the Scripture that this is the word of God; therefore by the Church. This I think is the ſum of your plea. We anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Again we do not diſclaim the uſe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Churches in the credence of the Word of God: but this doth not certifie us. Secondly, You Catholiques (as you would be called) ſpeak largely, that not one of the Ancients conceived it to be written in Greek; ſurely all the Ancients did not write: ſurely all that did write are not now had. But take it of all that did write and are now extant, and put it to be ſo that all were of Saint <hi>Jeromes</hi> Opinion in his Preface upon Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> yet all that you ſay is not certainly true, that there is not a Copy of the Hebrew Goſpel extant in all the world. For, (not to ſpeak of the Hebrew Goſpels ſet out by <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> which <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu</hi> takes notice of in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Notes upon the Goſpels) if you will give any heed to your <hi>Iſidor Clarius,</hi> he will tell you I ſuppoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; when he ſaith (in a little Preface which is a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie out of Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Catalogue of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick writers) that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> there affirms, <hi>ipſum He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braicum habetur uſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

So he. Now it may be that remains there, and therefore you cannot be certain of what you ſay. And this is more then an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Authority of the Church in an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Again how come your Latin interpretation of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to be authentique if it was not taken out of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick copie: for the Church can doe no more then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that which is authentique, then muſt it be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, otherwiſe they make Scripture.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40740:85"/>
            <p>Again let me give you one intimation, that poſſibly ſo might yet at firſt be written in Greek, my reaſon is this, in the firſt of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> 23. verſe, it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>they ſhall call his name Emmanuel,</hi> which being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted is; <hi>God with us.</hi> If it were written in Ebrew, what need of any interpretation in the ſame Language, ſince the Letters of the Word put together, without any variation, do make that ſignification?</p>
            <p>Again, if the Church hath made the Greek Tranſlation authentique, why is your Latin made authentique? Is there two authentiques? If it be not authentique by the Church, what would you infer?</p>
            <p>Again, the harmony of it with other Goſpels, hath more in it to perſwade Faith, then the credit of the Church.</p>
            <p>Again, if it be an Interpretation, yet unleſſe you do evince it, that we do build our Faith upon the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you do nothing. Now then as your people do fix their Faith upon that which is interpreted, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the interpretation: ſo may we build our belief upon this Goſpel to be the Word of God by the illumination of the Spirit of God, and yet not upon the Tranſlation. The Tranſlation doth but conveigh unto our knowledge the words, but it is the Spirit of God that doth work in us belief thereof that it is the VVord of God. The Tranſlation attends the Notification of the object, what that is which is to be believed: but it is the Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion which attends the act, and is the cauſe why it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: the Interpretation is but the Inſtrument of Faith, the ground of it is the perſwaſion of God, that it is the Truth and VVord of God: and therefore your argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation goes upon a wrong ſuppoſition, as if we reſolved our Faith in the Tranſlation as ſuch.</p>
            <p>And what you except afterwards againſt the certainty of our Faith, upon the account of the Greek Tranſlation, doth alſo return eaſily upon you; for the ſame poſſibility
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40740:86"/> of error, is urged againſt your Latin, either by ignorance, or negligence, or on purpoſe for the upholding of your new opinions. And let me ask you, why you account your Latin to be Authentique? you will ſay, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was infallibly aſſiſted in it. VVas it then Infallibly aſſiſted, when it renders the Ebrew in <hi>Geneſis ipſa</hi> for <hi>ipſum,</hi> that it might be for the honour of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin? VVell, but give it that the Latin was infallibly made by the Church, why not the Greek alſo infallibly made by the Church? and more confirmed by the Church then your Latin one? you get nothing then by this exception And this may ſatisfie you, how a <hi>Manichaan</hi> might believe the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> which you put to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. An opinion thereof he may have by the judgement of the Church, ſome knowledge of it to be the Word of God he may gather by the agreement with the other Goſpels: but the Faith of it to be ſuch, is to be wrought by the Spirit of God, whereby thoſe who heard the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, were cauſed to believe that which they preached to be the Word of God without perſwaſion of the Church, which was not then in a body, when ſome firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p>As for the Fathers holding Books to be Canonical by the Church, we have ſpoken to already in this paper, and we ſhall meet with it again. You ſpeak indeed of them as in general, upon deſigne, <hi>ad faciendum populum:</hi> but you do not name the places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> you are pleaſed to quote. VVe anſwer, if you mean that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Goſpels, and rejected the Goſpel of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> upon the Authority of the Church, as the cauſe of his Faith of them, you do not prove it by what he ſaies: If you mean that he was induced to think well of them by the reception of the Church, and to refuſe the other by their refuſal, this doth not come home to the queſtion. And ſuppoſe the Church its refuſal of the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> was ſufficient for him to refuſe it too, yet doth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40740:86"/> it not follow, that becauſe the Church did receive the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpels, he received them no otherwiſe, then becauſe they did; for this makes the reception of the ChurCh to be but as a neceſſary condition, not the formal cauſe of his Faith. As for <hi>Tertullians</hi> and Saint <hi>Jeroms</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> authorities in this caſe, we ſhall finde an anſwer, when you quote the places.</p>
            <p>The Teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> which you produce as out of the third Book, chap. 19. is not there, according to that of <hi>Robert Steven</hi> in Greek, which came out <hi>Lutetiae Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiorum cum Privilegio Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ninth Chapter indeed of the ſame Book, there is ſomewhat of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that he gives the number of the Books of the Old Teſtament, and which are uncontradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Ebrews, in the ſame words by them teaching as out of antient Tradition. But here we have but <hi>Joſephus</hi> his opinion. Secondly, This is but for the Old Teſtament, not the whole Scripture. Thirdly, This is but as out of Tradition. Fourthly, You will not find in the next chapter, all your Apocryphal books. The Number he makes to be 22. in which Number <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (in his fourth <hi>Cat.</hi>) excludes all but <hi>Baruch.</hi> Fifthly, After ſo much time which is paſt, he ſaies, no man durſt add or take away, or change any of them. And that which he ſpeaks at the end of the chapter that he followed Tradition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not erre; if you mean that, it is not pertinent, for he doth not there ſpeak of Scripture. Your flouriſh then as hereupon, muſt yet vaniſh. And beſides, all ſignes are not able to make a certainty, the Tradition of the Church is not an evident ſigne: it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for the Church received ſome things and held them too, which you will not hold, as Infant Communion, and the Millenary Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore can we not be aſſured in way of Faith (wherein there is no falſity) by the Church.</p>
            <p>That of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> will be included in the diſquiſition of the main Teſtimony of that Epiſtle.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:40740:87"/>
            <p>And to your queſtion which of the Fathers, when they were asked, did anſwer, that they did believe the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Books upon our ground; that which was ſaid in the former paper of Saint <hi>Origen</hi> and Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> remains good untill it be anſwered.</p>
            <p>In your thirteenth Number you object <hi>Luthers</hi> not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>James,</hi> to be Canonical by their own light. VVe anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, A negative argument from one is eaſily denyed to be cogent, when we cannot yeild it to the Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not ſee them, therefore they could not be ſeen, is no argument. Secondly, You ſee then hereby that we do not follow him in all things blindely, as you do the Church in whatſoever it propoſeth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Apocalyps</hi> was doubted of by others alſo, as you know by Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, although now it is univerſally received. So alſo might <hi>Luther</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come to the ſight of them to be Canonical.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, alſo other books have been ſcrupled, notwithſtanding the authority of the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how is that a ground of their Faith?</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> you make uſe of afterwards for the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicalneſſe of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> upon the credit of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and alſo the book of <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> To this we need ſay no more then hath been ſaid, ſave onely we may hence obſerve, how uncertain we are of a ground of Faith, in the authority of the Fathers, when one ſayes that which is contrary to the other. Anſwer you Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> upon the point, as before. And Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> I hope, yet was a Catholick, and was not damned becauſe he did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the opinion of the Church in this. If the Church be Infallible to Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> why not to Saint <hi>Jerome?</hi> or one may ſee that which is Infallible, and the other not, then is your former objection thereby taken away. And you will hold Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> no otherwiſe to have held the <hi>Macchabees</hi> to be Canonical, then he held the book of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40740:87"/> 
               <hi>Wiſedome</hi> to be Canonical, and you will hold that the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> held the book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> held the book of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> to be Canonical. This I ſuppoſe you will agree to without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute. Well then, be pleaſed to take notice of what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements and deductings may be found in Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon the place, in regard of Equalitie of Reſpect which you think he gave to this book of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> and to Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture. Firſt, it ſeems there was exception taken at the authority of that book, even in their Opinion of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> judgement thereupon; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi &amp; excepta,</hi> &amp;c. As if, if this atteſtation were excepted, the thing it ſelf were not clear, which we will have from hence to be taught, namely this; <hi>he was taken away, that wickedneſſe might not alter his underſtanding,</hi> which Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he ſaith, had taken out of the book of <hi>Wiſedome.</hi> And when he had diſcourſed the Truth of the ſentence, he inferrs; which things being ſo, this ſentence of the <hi>Book of Wiſedome</hi> ought not to be rejected, which hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited to be read of thoſe who are of the degree of Readers of the Church by ſo long antiquitie; and then follow your words. Onely you may excuſe me, if ſecondly I be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle critical; for it is not ſaid there that it was received of all, but it was heard of all, with veneration of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. If there be no difference, why doe ye not uſe the word? if you do falſifie, then it ſeems there is ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and outwardly they might give reſpect to it as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, although whether in their apprehenſions they did eſteem it as ſuch may be a queſtion. But thirdly, you ſee it here to be ſomewhat diſtinguiſhed from Books Canonical and to depend upon preſcription; as if it were not ſo from the beginning. Fourthly, thoſe who were Tractatours next to the time of the Apoſtles did prefer this book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves, which uſing this as a witneſſe did believe that they brought no other then a Divine Teſtimony. So the Father, whereby is intimated that this was as <hi>deutero</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:40740:88"/> Canonical (as it is expreſſed) and not of proper name, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical; and alſo herein is ſignified that it was not ſo uſed in the Apoſtles times. And again, this Book had meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be read by ſo great a numeroſitie of years, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he calls this ſentence anciently Chriſtian. So upon the whole matter you ſee ſome difference made betwixt this book and others by themſelves Canonical.<note place="margin">De Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Sancto rum, <hi>cap. 14.</hi>
               </note> Peruſe then the whole chapter, and you will ſee how little advantage you can make thereof. Indeed there is in the chapter a word which I know not whether I have rendred according to your mind; it is <hi>mereri,</hi> and yet I think I have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it diſcreetly by meriting, that ſo it might be capable of the ſame Latitude; but I put you to your choice: How the Fathers uſe the word you know for obtaining. But if you will have it here to be conſtrued by plain deſerving, then we have an Argument againſt you: For if the book deſerved to be read in the Church, then was it not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Divine and Canonical, becauſe it was received by the Church; but it was received by the Church, becauſe it did deſerve it by the matter. If you will not underſtand it here of plain deſerving, then here is one place, where the Father uſeth the words not in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſence; which may be made uſe of to another pupoſe about your opinion of merit; and alſo, if you will not mean it here of deſerving, this makes ſome diminution of reſpect to the book: and ſome advantage more I ſhall make of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in its place.</p>
            <p>Many lines in your fourteenth page you have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wherein we have nothing but vaunts or repetitions: I will not trouble you with the latter, nor my ſelf with the former: But towards the end of that page you would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter ſo as to hold your own, and yet to give Scripture its due reſpects. And you ſeem to bring it to this determination, that when there is an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made that the Scriptures are in themſelves the Word of God, it doth not derogate from Scripture to hold that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40740:88"/> yet they are not known to us by an infallible ground, that they are the Word of God, but by the teſtimony of the Church, which in ſhorter terms is expreſſed by others of your Church, that the authoritie of the Scripture doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Church. But this will not ſerve, the covering is too ſhort.</p>
            <p>For firſt, this diſtinction is too narrow to extend to the difference betwixt us in particular points of faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you will yield that points of Religion are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and ended infallibly by Scripture, when we know it to be the Word of God, then we will onely ſtick to this Queſtion: But if you will ſtill maintain the infallibilitie of the Church in all her definitions, then your compoſition will not be ſufficient, although it could ſatisfie as to that particular. But ſecondly, It will not ſatisfie, becauſe you do not ſufficiently provide for the honour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures authoritie, and therefore you derogate from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this, although you did take away no honour from Scripture as in regard of its truth.</p>
            <p>Do you lay it to heart, that the many queſtions betwixt us is about the authoritie of the Scripture; the formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of credibilitie is the authoritie. That which makes me to believe it to be the Truth of God, as being his Word, is the Authoritie. For if the credibilitie doth riſe from the truth of it in it ſelf, you deſtroy your own cauſe; for that you confeſſe the Scripture to be the infallible Word of God: then betwixt us ſimply about the Truth of the Scripture there is no conteſt. And doe not you affirm that the authoritie of the Church is the Ground of Faith, becauſe you think that the Church by its authoritie is worthy to be believed ſince it is infallible? But why then do you not grant this authority to the Scripture, ſince you confeſs it to be infallible? If the reaſon of believing the Church be the infallibility of it, according to you; why is not the infallibility of the Scripture the reaſon of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, ſince it is confeſſed infallible? And if you ſay
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40740:89"/> you do believe it to be ſo by the authority of the Church, then the formal reaſon of believing it is not the infallibility of the Scripture, but of the Church; and yet the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church ſhall be the formal reaſon of believing it. But you ſay, you muſt know the Scripture to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, that I cannot do but by the Church. Well, but do not you then ſee that you preferre the authority of the Church before the authority of Scripture: for the Church with you, is to be believed for it ſelf: for ſo it muſt be; or elſe the Scripture muſt be believed for it ſelf, or elſe we ſhall have in Divinity no <hi>principium primo primum,</hi> wherein to reſt. Now if the Scripture be to be believed for it ſelf, then we have ended the buſineſſe. If the Church be to be believed for it ſelf, then we prefer the Authority of the Church before the authority of Scripture, then you dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the authority of Scripture. Thirdly, the Church hath authority or not. It hath you ſay, then of it ſelf or not, what will you ſay? If of it ſelf, what hath a company of Chriſtians more to ſay for themſelves then others. If you ſay the authority comes from ſucceſſion; others alſo have had a conſtant ſucceſſion. And it muſt come to one firſt ſociety: Well, where had that ſociety its authority, of it ſelf or not? If of it ſelf, what by revelation beſide Scripture or not? If beſide, then the charge of <hi>Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs</hi> is fallen upon you. What then? From Scripture. Well then the Scripture in regard of thoſe Texts which concern the Church is to be believed for it ſelf, and then why not in others? Fourthly, The Word of God in the ſubſtance and matter of it was before the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe the Church was begotten by it: and therefore it muſt be known before the Church. Yea, reconcile your Opinion with that of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his firſt Book <hi>De Verbo Dei, cap.</hi> 20. The Rule of Catholique Faith muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and known; for if it be not known, then it will not be a Rule to us: If it be not certain, it cannot be a Rule. If it be a known Rule againſt <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> why not alſo a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40740:89"/> known Rule againſt Papiſts; and therefore that it muſt be made manifeſt by the Church is not neceſſary, for how was it made manifeſt to the firſt Church to be the rule?</p>
            <p>As for the inſtance of yours, that Chriſt was made manifeſt to many by the Teſtimony of the Baptiſt and of the Apoſtles before the Scriptures were written, and yet this derogate? not from Scripture; We anſwer ſoon. Firſt, It is yet to be proved whether the Church hath that inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles had for the firſt planting of the Church; until that be made good, your Argumentation is not. Secondly, Although the New Teſtament was not written, the Old was, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles preached no other Doctrine then was contained in the Old. So our Saviour, <hi>If ye had believed</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye would have believed me,</hi> for he wrote of me in the 5. of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the 46. verſe. Thirdly, If <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles were believed by a Divine Faith without the authority of the Church (as the firſt Diſciples did) why may not the Scriptures be believed by a Divine Faith without the authority of the Church? If the Apoſtles were believed immediately without the Church in what they ſaid: why may they not be believed alſo in what they wrote?</p>
            <p>And ſurely, to goe a little more cloſe and deep, if we ſpeak properly, there is not ſo much a ground of Faith, as a cauſe; if with the Schoolmen we grant (as we may) that Faith is a ſupernatural habit, infuſed by God, which diſpoſeth the underſtanding to aſſert that which is ſaid by God is true, becauſe he ſaith it, not becauſe the Church ſaith it. And if you ſay that the Scripture and the Church are not oppoſite; true, when the Church ruleth it ſelf by Scripture. But if the Queſtion be, which propoſal is firſt, that of the Scripture, or that of the Church; here the Church is oppoſite to Scripture if it pretend to be firſt, for both cannot be firſt. Therefore the firſt <hi>Axiom</hi> in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and conſequently of Divine Faith, muſt be that the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40740:90"/> Scripture is the Word of God: and then this Scripture is ſubſtracted as the ground of all particulars to be neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believed; and therefore if we ſhould have no other Faith of Scripture, then by the credibility of the Church, for ought is yet proved we ſhould have no Divine Faith.</p>
            <p>In your 14. Number, you go about to prove that the Scripture is not the appointed Judge in all Controverſies: For many things (you ſay) are ſo ſet down in Scripture, that almoſt all the Controverſies which are in the Church, doe ariſe about the true interpretation of the Scripture. We Anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, here we ſee that you would have more to be the queſtion then that, Whether the Church be the judge of the Books Canonical, and that the Scripture is the VVord of God. Therefore we follow you, and do ſay, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That it ſeems then the Queſtion is onely who ſhould be the infallible Judge to diſcuſſe and decide the debates which do ariſe about the ſenſe of Scripture. So then again, thoſe things which are plainly ſet down in Scripture (as the many neceſſary things are) are allowed to be believed without the voice of the Church: and therefore all points of Faith you cannot, it ſeems, include within the compaſs of neceſſary ſubmiſſion to the Church therein. Thirdly, your diſcourſe proceeds not effectually to your concluſion, unleſſe you can prove that the uncertainty of the ſenſe of ſome paſſages in Scripture doth convince the neceſſity of an infallible Judge herein. Secondly, That we are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly certain thereof. And Thirdly, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is it. Theſe particulars are yet depending, and without their affirmation we may affirm that God hath well enough provided for the ſalvation of men in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is more eaſie to be underſtood, then the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent of all the Fathers; whoſe Opinions alſo muſt be held true as they are agreeable to the Rule. And alſo hath he provided wiſely for us, in that he hath not left us
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40740:90"/> to the <hi>Lesbian</hi> Rule of humane authority: and alſo hath provided for the peace of the Church, in that he hath given us direction of the Paſtours; whom although we cannot abſolutely believe, yet doe not impudently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Yet you will ſay, if Chriſt had intended this book for our ſole Judge (infallible you mean, otherwiſe you doe not contradict me) in all controverſies, he would undoubtedly in ſome part of this book have told us ſo clearly, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ſo exceedingly as it doth; and yet he hath not done ſo. We anſwer, Chriſt hath diſertly declared his will to oblige us unto Scripture, in that <hi>he bindeth us to ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> in that he ſaith, <hi>ye erre not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> as before: In that he ſaid by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>all Scripture is given by Inſpiration and is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>it is able to make the man of God wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as before; And by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. Ep. 1. cap. 19. <hi>we have a more ſure word of Propheſie, to which you do well giving heed, as to a Light that ſhineth in a dark place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> And as for Paſtours of the Church, again and again we ſay, we deny them not a lawful uſe, or to them a lawful reſpect in things of God: but they doe but carry the Lantern in the dark. So that by this Light of Scripture are we directed unto ſalvation. Secondly, We turn the mouth of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt you, if Chriſt had intended that the Church ſhould have been the infallible Judge, it import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo exceedingly, he would have told us ſo clearly, and infallibly, which he hath not done. He telleth us all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by inſpiration; and this Propoſition if we rightly believe, we believe upon its own authority, becauſe it was given by inſpiration: but it is not as clearly ſaid, that the Church judgeth by inſpiration. And if it doth, why doth it not determine all Controverſies in the Church; and therefore is it either wanting in ability, or peccant in duty. Or if there may be Controverſies in your Church without
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40740:91"/> definition of the Church, why may not there be Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies amongſt us, without actual deciſion of Scripture.</p>
            <p>And now, Sirs, let me have leave to ſpeak affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you, do you not ſee what diſ-reſpects of Scripture (if not Blaſphemies) your Opinion doth miſerably betray you to, if you follow it? Would any ſober man let fall ſuch words? as if God had intended the Scripture for our Judge, ſuch a book as the Scripture is. So you. VVhy? which often times ſpeaks ſo prophetically, that moſt would think he ſpeaks of the time preſent, when he ſpeaks of the time to come. So you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, how are theſe words put together, ſo Prophetically, that, &amp;c. would it ſeem to be more Propheticall to ſpeak under the formality of futurition? but if it be Prophetical, to ſpeak of that which is to come, as in <hi>verbis de praeſens,</hi> then what can you blame in that part of Scripture which is Prophetical? Or do you think that it was not meet that in the Old Teſtament there ſhould be ſomewhat Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical? Or will you think that God made that part of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture on purpoſe obſcure, that there might be need of your Infallible Judge? Secondly, The Prophecies are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Preſent Tenſe, which in proper the Jewes have not, but in the time paſt, to ſignifie the certainty of their accompliſhment, and alſo, becauſe as with God they are already done, ſince he looks upon all differences of time with one ſingle act of intuition: and as for thoſe Prophecies which reſpect Chriſt, they are ſo expreſſed, that thereby may be ſignified, that the merit of Chriſt did extend to ſome, even before the times wherein thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promiſes were made, and therefore the manner of Prophetical expreſſions, is upon good reaſon eaſily diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if not by the people, yet by the Miniſters of the Church, without an Infallible Judge.</p>
            <p>And what then, if it ſpeaks of Chriſt under the Type of <hi>David,</hi> when not onely the Letter ſignifies a thing, but the thing another thing, and one perſon repreſents ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:40740:91"/> Is not this for the excellency of Scripture, without ſuch obſcurity, when we believe <hi>David</hi> was a Prophet, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe which ſpoke of him were Prophets, and when we are in Scripture directed to ſuch an uſe of Types. And if any thing be ſpoken obſcurely, yet if it be a matter neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, there are other Texts more eaſie to compare it with, and to expound it by, as your <hi>Aquinas</hi> in his firſt Page. 1. q. 9, 10. Articles. And therefore this exception is not able to argue the neceſſity of your Infallible Judge, no more then diverſity, as you ſay of ſenſes of Scripture; wherein it is to be underſtood; whereas there is but one ſenſe of Scripture principally intended, which is expreſſed ſometimes properly, ſometimes improperly. As for the myſtical Divinity, you know it is not argumentative, but where it is declared in Scripture. And as for the ſetting out of things Spiritual in way of Tranſlation from things Temporal; you may conſider it is neceſſary, if you will believe your Angelical Doctor, becauſe, (ſince our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge comes here by ſenſe) we cannot for this ſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, but by compare to things of ſenſe: ſo that there muſt upon this account be Metaphors; and what are Allegories, but Metaphors continued? And as for the Tropological ſenſe, which reſpects inſtitution of life, that is not difficultly found in more clear precepts. Again, if by impropriety of ſpeech, we ſhould conclude an abſolute need of an Infallible Judge, then how ſhould we Infallibly be guided by the opinion of the Fathers, ſince ſo many of them, eſpecially <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> (who were of the antienteſt of them) are ſo full of this obſcurity?</p>
            <p>And as for your Objection, that both Precepts and Councils are delivered in the Mood Imperative; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably conceive that we ſhould be ſo ignorant and credulous, as to think that we ſhould ſwallow down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chewing, this your ſuppoſition, that there are Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of Perfection, above things of Command, for when
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40740:92"/> we have done all, we muſt ſay that we are unprofitable Servants; we have done what we ought to do, St. <hi>Luke</hi> the 17. and 10. Unprofitable, not onely to God, (as your men diſtinguiſh) but alſo unprofitable to our ſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have done but our duty, if we did as much as we could, which none does, and yet if we did as much as we could, we ſhould not do ſo much as we ſhould, ſince the Commands of God are given to us, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our ability in <hi>Adam;</hi> which we loſt by our own fault. Our obedience therefore, by it ſelfe, cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
            <p>Another default you will finde or make in Scripture, that it doth no where ſet down a Catalogue of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. But do you think in earneſt that this is a cogent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for your cauſe? The Scripture doth not ſet down a Catalogue of Fundamentals, therefore it is not to be the Judge of Controverſies.</p>
            <p>To your Antecedent we ſay, that the Scripture doth give us every particular point which is neceſſary to be believed, although it doth not give out the Number thereof formall and material, how many and which they are.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It doth not onely afford that which is ſimply neceſſary, but doth furniſh us with many other particulars, ſo that it is an abundant directory for our uſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there no defect of Wiſdome in this Law-maker, when he gives us ſuch a Law that Infallibly contains all neceſſaries and more, and when thoſe neceſſaries are not onely plainly delivered, but alſo what is not plainly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is thereby ſignified not to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Again, we admit humane dijudications of doubts emergent in ſome points, and they have their uſe with us, without Infallibility.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Either the Scripture yet, notwithſtanding this, is it whereby we muſt be determined in points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or elſe the Church; but the Church by the ſame
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40740:92"/> argument, is not the Judge, becauſe it doth not define whatſoever may be neceſſary to be held by a full Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique in your ſenſe. Whether the Pope hath Temporal power or not, is not this neceſſary to be determined? if it be determined, how came your <hi>Heart</hi> to deny it? then whether he hath power Temporal directly, as the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, or indirectly as others, is this determined? then how came <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to go againſt his Conſcience on one ſide or other? for he varied herein, as your <hi>Widdrington</hi> ſpeaks of him. And <hi>Widdrington</hi> he is another againſt his power, in his Apology for the right and Soveraignty of temporal Princes.</p>
            <p>And why is not the queſtion decided, whether the Pope be Superiour to a Council in things Eccleſiaſticall, which the Sorboniſts deny? Are not there high points which are of weight to move an Infallible Concluſion? Not to ſpeak of Gods predetermination, or whether the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was Conceived without Original ſin. How is then the Church the Infallible Judge of Controverſies? If you ſay that the Church determines as much as is neceſſary; well then, and ſo hath the Scripture, which you acknowledge is Infallible: but are not the former points neceſſary? what can you inſtance in which is more neceſſary, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in Scripture? If our Salvation, as you hold, be in jeopardy for not ſubmitting to the Infallible Judge, what can be of more concernment then to know Infallibly who he is, and what power he hath, which yet your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Religion will never make a determination of?</p>
            <p>After this you taxe our Doctrine to be contrary to Scripture, and firſt in the matter of Extream Unction by Saint <hi>James.</hi> We ſay (if you ſay right, that it is clear againſt us by Scripture) then the Scripture hath decided this queſtion, then the Scripture can judge and end Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. And yet at the beginning hereof, you ſpeak very warily and diſcreetly it ſeems. If by this term you would have us believe, that it is not evidently declared
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40740:93"/> againſt us in Scripture, then we need ſay no more as to this caſe. If it be manifeſt by Scripture againſt us, and you mean your word <hi>(ſeems)</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others uſe it, in way of Elegance, or of courſe, then it doth not abate the tenure of the affirmative; and then what need we any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judge? ſo are you held by this Dilemma. Secondly, That command of Saint <hi>James</hi> imports no Sacrament as you would have it; but doth relate to the gift of Healing in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>Another example of our difference from Scripture, you preſſe the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to be in our ſenſe. We anſwer firſt, You ſay the words of Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are clear in this Sacrament, in which any wiſe Man would ſpeak clearly; and yet afterwards you ſay this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie the Scripture doth not decide. How far are theſe from a contradiction? if clear, then either is decided or needs none, but it is for your turn that it ſhould be clear and not decided, clear againſt us: not decided for you. VVell here again you incur the former inconvenience, which I will let paſſe. Secondly, The words indeed are clear for the nature of a Sacrament, which under a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne repreſents a ſpiritual thing; and ſo therefore for the condition of a Sacrament, any wiſe man could not ſpeak more conveniently then in a figurative ſenſe, becauſe it is ſymbolical to the Sacrament. For if the real preſence as you mean, be corporal, then is the property of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament deſtroyed, becauſe the ſigne is turned into that which is ſignified. And you are in more capacity to yeild a figurative ſenſe here, becauſe elſewhere you do object too much of it, and here too little. Indeed if Scripture had no other handling but yours, it would after it, more need an Infallible Judge. Is there no more likely-hood of a figurative ſenſe in the words, then there is of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Accident without the Subject; or of the Body of Chriſt, to be in Heaven and on Earth, and in thouſands of places at once?</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:40740:93"/>
            <p>But you contend the improbability of this ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he took the Bread and the Cup in his hand, and ſaid this is my Body, and this is my Bloud. Surely this makes no prejudice againſt us; for this was neceſſary towards the conſecrating of that Bread and that Wine, otherwiſe there would have been a Conſecration of Bread and VVine in <hi>Communi,</hi> and therefore he ſpoke demonſtratively, and this demonſtration makes the Subject no leſſe capable of a figure then the Praedicate; and what difference? <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> or <hi>this is the Lamb of God.</hi> So in the 9. to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the 20. verſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> having taken the Bloud of Calves and Goats ſaid, <hi>This is the Bloud of the Teſtament.</hi> VVas that Bloud tranſubſtantiated into the Bloud of Chriſt? or when one takes his Teſtament, may he not ſay this is my VVill, although it be but the ſigne of his Will.</p>
            <p>You take notice alſo, of the different opinions there are about the ſenſe of the words of Inſtitution. We have no cauſe to take it to our ſelves, who have not ſuch variety of conceits therein. Neither can you, I am ſure, juſtifie your Infallibility by your accord herein, ſince ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether it be tranſubſtantiated, and therefore have they a proviſo of a conditionate adoration, <hi>Adoro te ſi tu es Chriſtus,</hi> and ſo many amongſt you differ about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the change; whether by production, which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth (as is noted) the Body not to praeexiſte, and this is falſe; or by adduction, which ſuppoſeth againſt Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, or by a kinde of Conſervative Converſion, which is little elſe then a Contradiction <hi>in adjecto,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwer your ſelf. How is it more clearly defined by the Church, which was ſcarce in debate till the time of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius?</hi> Did the Church all that while want neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to Salvation? But laſtly, you ſhould not have pleaded Scripture for this point on your ſide, if you will believe <hi>Scotus,</hi> and your Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> who ſayes, that <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> held Tranſubſtantiation could not be clearly proved by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40740:94"/> any Text of Scripture and he himſelf thinks it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Therefore herein you cannot, in their judgement, convince us by Scripture, and therefore till the Church be Infallible, it is no doctrine of Faith; as it was not before the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> as <hi>Scotus</hi> affirmed by <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Confeſſion, in the 23. chapter of the third Book, <hi>De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento Euchariſtia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but if Tranſubſtantiation be not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scripture, then our opinion negative to you is more ſecure, and is not concluded not to be in Scripture, though you or others will not profeſſe it.</p>
            <p>In the former part of your 15. Number, you go over a former argument again, to which the former anſwer may ſerve. As for the other part of your Paragraph concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the points of Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed, which are not clearly delivered in Scripture, and yet he that will be ſaved muſt think thus. I anſwer, Although the matter of them be not <hi>in terminis,</hi> found in Scripture, yet the ſenſe of them according to aequivalence may, as well as Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, when you will endevour to make it out by Scripture. Secondly, Although we believe what is ſaid in his Creed, yet therefore are we not bound to believe it by the Authority of the Church, ſince he would have held it, although the Church had not, as he did ſometimes differ from the common profeſſion of the Church, in the Conſubſtantiality of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the 16. Paragraph, you ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which you had ſaid before, to it we ſay nothing, but you raiſe a new oppoſition. Baptiſme of Children to be neceſſary to their Salvation, is a prime point of Belief, and yet you cannot believe this prime point of Belief by any clear place of Scripture, therefore you mean all neceſſary points are not clearly believed by Scripture, therefore by the Church; this muſt be your diſſertation, and your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor propoſition you confirme by the Teſtimony of Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> We Anſwer, firſt to your Major, by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a neceſſity of Baptiſme in general, it is neceſſary by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40740:94"/> neceſſity of precept, but it is not neceſſary by neceſſity of mean to the child, ſo as that if it be not baptized, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly damned; the former reſpects the Parents, that they ſhould take care of it for their children, but if they do not, or the child be taken away as many are before it can be done by a lawful Miniſter, we cannot conclude it or them abſolutely periſhed; ſince it is not ſo neceſſary to them that were of age at the Primitive Inſtitution, Saint <hi>Mark</hi> the 16.16. <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned;</hi> not alſo, and is not Baptized: For many there were, and caſes might be put, that there might be more which could not have Baptiſme before they died: as appears by your <hi>Vicarium Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſma,</hi> which the Fathers ſpeaks of. Then, though we may well aſſure our ſelves, that if Infants rightly Baptized die ſuch, they are certainly ſaved: yet can we not as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly paſſe the Verdict of Damnation upon thoſe which are not Baptized.</p>
            <p>As to your aſſumption, we alſo diſtinguiſh, if you mean we cannot believe this <hi>Poedobaptiſme</hi> by any clear place of Scripture, namely, <hi>in terminis terminantibus,</hi> as they ſpeak expreſly, we grant it: but this is not enough for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And if you mean it cannot be clearly believed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by conſequence it cannot be proved, or becauſe it cannot be clearly beleeved ſince it is beleeved by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; then we deny your aſſumption in both regards. For whatſoever is neceſſarily inferred from Scripture is binding in the vertue of the principle, and therefore clearly we may beleeve it. Now the inſtitution of Baptiſme in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral by Chriſt; the ſubſtitution of it to circumciſion (ſince there is the ſame Covenant in ſubſtance to both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) is a ſufficient Principle to infer the neceſſity of Baptiſme of Infants, beſides what may be ſuppoſed by baptizing whole Families. And therefore this is none of thoſe things which are not grounded in Scripture, and therefore no Object of the Church Tradition. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40740:95"/> Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> Teſtimony will come to no more then this, that though they had nothing for certain alledged out of the Canonical Books in this point, yet the truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is kept when they do that which ſeemed good to the Catholique Church; namely, ſo far as the Catholique Church keepeth the Truth in clearing that which is not plain in Scripture. Which Church the Scripture doth commend, as he. But is it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for infallibility? If not, this Teſtimony and all your Teſtimonies and all your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which you have of things not determined in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but determined by the Church, will doe you no good, for you muſt prove that they were and ought to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly determined by the Church upon neceſſity of ſalvation; becauſe you would conclude your poſtulate of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an infallible Judge. Now then if thoſe things were not infallibly determined, the inſtances thereof are of no uſe to you. And you may conſider that we may in things of practice (which in their nature are of free Obſervation, as being neither commanded or forbidden by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and ſhould follow the Church therefore to bring it to an iſſue: Either this <hi>Poedobaptiſme</hi> was Infallibly followed by the Church or not, if infallibly, it was ſo by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Paedobaptiſme</hi> in Scripture, although not perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous. If not infallibly, yet might they follow the Church, and ſhould in this Caſe; becauſe if it had been free to them to have done ſo or not in regard of the thing, yet ſhould they have gone in the way of the Church, when there was nothing to the contrary; much more ſhould they conform in this which had that reaſon in the Analogy of Scripture; and therefore this Teſtimony of the Father need not move us, whereſoever we find it; for I cannot find it by your direction. Give me ſome better direction to find the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the Tradition of the Church to be the moſt true and inviolable Rule of Truth reduplicatively namely, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its own account, and in things neceſſary; then I ſhall ſay more or yield.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:40740:95"/>
            <p>He holdeth therefore (you ſay) the Tradition of the Church ſo infallible that it may be a ground of Faith. Here are two things to be ſaid. Firſt, that he holdeth ſo of Tradition, which by other Teſtimonies is to be proved. Since, Secondly, he doth not hold it therefore of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince theſe words of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> doe not draw after them the nature of Tradition in your ſence; which doth not depend upon the written Word, as this doth for the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>And you believe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught him ſo in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2.15. <hi>Hold the Traditions which you have been taught, whether by word or by our Epiſtle.</hi> To this we anſwer, premiſing the ſtate of the Queſtion; whether Doctrine of Faith not depending upon the word written do oblige Faith equally to Scripture. Now we ſay, that theſe Traditions might reſpect Order and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, or Hiſtory, and ſo comes not within compaſs of the Queſtion, in regard of the matter. Secondly, Though it will not pleaſe <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon the place, yet nothing hinders but that it might be meant of the ſame matter, which was firſt preached, then written; and then ſhould hold it or them, as firſt preached, then written; and this is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond anſwer, in the place doth come into our queſtion in reſpect of the matter; for the <hi>Syriack</hi> renders it, <hi>Mandats, Commandements,</hi> which do not ſignifie formally matters of Faith. Thirdly, The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> might be ſure that what they had from him by word, was ſuch as they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve equally to what was written: but ſo cannot we be of your Doctrines of Faith which you ſay are handed from Generation to Generation. Make us as ſure of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Divine Inſpiration and communication to us, then urge our Obedience equal. And this will give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon the place, who meaneth no otherwiſe, then that which they had from God by him, whether in word or writing they ſhould hold, which they could beleeve; we can not for ſuch Traditions, having n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40740:96"/> that certainty of them. Read the whole of him upon that Text; and alſo do not paſſe by the Obſervation of this modeſty herein: we may think it worthy of beleef, namely the Tradition of the Church, which whether he means it of things of Diſcipline and order (wherein we deny not conformity to the Church) we are not ſure of; but there come not up to our Queſtion: for they are not of Faith, and do not equally oblige.</p>
            <p>And hitherto now you have gone about to aſſure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of a neceſſity of an infallible Judge; now in your 17. Paragr. you will aſſume that the Catholique Church, is the Judge. Then the Roman to be the Catholique prudently.</p>
            <p>The text you name for the Catholick Church is that of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> in his 16 Chap. the 18 Verſe, <hi>I ſay unto thee thou art</hi> Peter (that is to S. <hi>Peter</hi> by name) <hi>thou art</hi> Peter (that is thou art a rock) <hi>and upon this rock will I build my Church; and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> &amp;c. And now ſurely you are at your ſtrong hold, which you think cannot be undermined or ſtormed, true, if your application of it were as ſure as it.</p>
            <p>But we are not careful to anſwer you in this aſſault. Firſt, we deny your interpretation of the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> you interpret the Greek, that is a rock; it is denied, the Greek word doth not ordinarily, and not here ſignifie a rock. And if you will not believe me, take this argument, <hi>Cephas</hi> ſignifieth a ſtone: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>(Petrus)</hi> ſignifieth as <hi>Cephas,</hi> therefore a ſtone. Both propoſitions you have proved, as you may ſee, in S. <hi>John,</hi> 1.42, 43. as in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, <hi>Thou ſhalt be called Cephas,</hi> that is a ſtone; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as in the Greek; which is interpreted <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſtone. And becauſe <hi>Cephas</hi> is known in Siriack to ſignifie a ſtone, therefore the Syriack doth not add theſe words [which is interpreted] and that <hi>Petrus</hi> ſignifieth as <hi>Cephas</hi> you have there; for <hi>Cephas</hi> is interpreted by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus,</hi> therefore your interpretation is not right.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you ſay, as you did before, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40740:96"/> was the Original of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel; then are you not nearly obliged to the <hi>Syriack</hi> which is but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect thereof? nay likely the very Dialect of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> wherein it was firſt written, if not in <hi>Greek,</hi> and then not onely can you not interpret <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>A Rock,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then you cannot render the following words as you do, And <hi>upon this Rock,</hi> &amp;c. For the words in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack</hi> are letter for letter the ſame; both the name of the Apoſtles; and the word which you render <hi>a Rock,</hi> are the ſame, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> both, and therefore if you will ſtand to the <hi>Syriack,</hi> it will come to this, <hi>Thou art a ſtone, and upon this ſtone will I build my Church.</hi> And this will have fair Correſpondence with that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Built upon the Foundation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone.</hi> So that the priviledge of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> here was onely this, to lay as it were the firſt ſtone, in this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nay thirdly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the New Teſtament more then once ſignifieth <hi>a ſtone, Rom.</hi> 9. laſt. it is ſynonymically joyned there with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is joyned alſo to the ſame Metaphor, in that it is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for this muſt ſignifie <hi>a ſtone of offence;</hi> for whoever ſtumbled at <hi>a Rock?</hi> and therefore a ſcandal in the Church is by <hi>Aquinas</hi> defined by that which gives to others an occaſion of falling. So alſo in the very ſame manner are they put together by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf in his 1. Ep. 2. Verſe 8. And we have reaſon to think that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did underſtand the ſenſe of Chriſts words to him, and the reaſon of his name.</p>
            <p>And thus for your Interpretation of this Text.</p>
            <p>As for the application of it, we ſay firſt, whereas you referre this to the Perſon of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> you may know that you differ from the Ancients, who did refer it to the Confeſſion of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and not to his act of his Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as his; but as to the Object, which was confeſſed, which your <hi>Iſidor Clarius</hi> may be thought to aim at, when he Expounds, <hi>ſuper hanc Petram, ſuper hanc fidel ſoliditatem.</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:40740:97"/> For <hi>Piſcator</hi> notes well that this rock cannot be meant of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> becauſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> is one of the believers which were built upon this rock. And therefore one hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that Chriſt ſpake [this rock] <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> pointing at himſelf; as where he ſayes deſtroy this Temple, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his body, and ſo the copulative may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by way of Ebraiſme; and upon this rock, but upon this rock. Secondly, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake here for the reſt of the Apoſtles; where that which is granted is common to him with the reſt of the Apoſtles, as that which follows, and I will give thee the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven: unleſſe you can Evince it that that which is here promiſed or given to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> really different from that which is given to all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the 20. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 22, 23. verſe, and then ſhall you do more then you <hi>Hart</hi> in his Colloquie with <hi>Rainolds.</hi> There is the ſame power and authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Metaphor; For what difference will you make betwixt binding and retaining, and looſing or remitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo then let me ask you this queſtion: was the primacy of authority given to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> here at that time, or after the Reſurrection given, here promiſed? If given here, then after this priviledges of Infallibility, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maſter; therefore ſomebody of yours, and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> as I remember, wittily imagineth, that this authority was given to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> after his Reſurection, that ſo the ſucceſſors of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might not have the poſſibility of denying Chriſt entailed upon them: If promiſed there, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then, where will you finde any Text more ſymbolical then that of the 20. of Saint <hi>John</hi> forenamed? and that was given to the Apoſtles <hi>communiter.</hi> Therefore if [I will give] reſpects the future, and after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, as <hi>Iſidor Glorius</hi> doth note; then confeſſe it to be accompliſhed here, or name any Text, which hath better alluſion thereunto. And if the Superiority of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was neither given nor promiſed here, where
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40740:97"/> then? and why is this Text made to bear falſe witneſſe by you for you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Superiority of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in juriſdiction, as to be Prince of the Apoſtles, as your men ſpeak, is flatly contrary to our Saviours own Order in the 20. of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> the 26. verſe; for when <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> were petitioned for by their mother for preheminency; Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, &amp; thoſe that are great exerciſe authority upon them; but it ſhall not be ſo amongſt you.</hi> Then here is the Controverſie determined by our Saviour in Scripture. St. <hi>Peter</hi> then was not to have any authority over the reſt. Not that from hence can be argued, that there ſhould be no one Superior to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as Sectaries would urge it; but none of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to be ſuperior, to have dominion, to exerciſe authority over the other of the Apoſtles. Here is a plain Text for the paritie of the Apoſtles, which deſtroyes the foundation of the Roman Church, which now you ſpeak for.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Put caſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had been conſtituted Prince of the Apoſtles, and of the Church conſequently, yet have you another infinite labour to make good the ſucceſſion of theſe priviledges to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by Divine Right. Why not rather to <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> ſince alſo by a Divine Faith we cannot be aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was ever at <hi>Rome.</hi> We do not deny it, but yet by you it is not made out to be an object of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, that he was there. And to name no other prejudices againſt you in this, you are put to very hard ſhifts for the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>hereof, when you are compelled to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Babylon</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the 1 Ep. 5. c. &amp; 13. v. of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>Rome.</hi> Certainly had your men any other Text for it, they would not have given us this occaſion and example to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Babylon</hi> in another place to be <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Iſidor</hi> is ſomewhat tender in this Expoſition, it is not very likely, ſaith he, that it ſhould be underſtood of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40740:98"/> that <hi>Babylon,</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> or that in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but it is <hi>admodum credibile,</hi> very credible that it is meant of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon the place cites the firſt Author for this Interpretation of it to be <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the ſame who was the Father of the Milinary Opinion, namely <hi>Papias.</hi> But fifthly, The former Text of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> is not to be meant of any Church of one Denomination, and if ſo, it had been meant of one not of <hi>Rome.</hi> For then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had not been made good of not falling into damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errours, for ſo the gates of Hell ſhould prevail againſt it. The gates of Hell have prevailed againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Head and Members; as you may ſee more at large in the Diſcourſe of <hi>Raynolds</hi> with <hi>Hart.</hi> What ſay you to <hi>Liberius</hi> his ſubſcribing to the cenſure of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and did not he ſubſcribe to the errour then which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> withſtood? And were not the Members included in the Head? And ought not they to do ſo as he under peril of damnation? But ſixthly, whereas you ſay that by Chriſt the Church is ſecured from any damnable errour, we have enough againſt you by this intimation; if you mean it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctively, as methinks you do. For you inſinuate here that Chriſt doth not intend her exemption from all errour, for then you are in greater danger of not being the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which that Favour is granted: but he doth here free it from damnable errour, becauſe elſe the gates of Hell ſhould prevail againſt it: So then again it is not neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be free from all errour. Well then upon theſe two conceſſions that the Church of Chriſt may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to errour, though not damna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> becauſe again, every errour doth not damne, we exclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the infallibility of the Church, for it may erre it ſeems: and alſo we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the neceſſity of ſuch an infallibility, for we may be ſaved notwithſtanding ſome errours, and what need then of an infallible Judge ſince in points of queſtion ſimple errour is not damnative? and where indeed ſhall we have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40740:98"/> an infallible Judge, if there be fallibility in any particular; If the Spirit of God ſpeaks in the Church by infallible aſſiſtance, cannot the Spirit of God infallibly determine all points? or if it aſſiſts infallibly only to material Articles which are neceſſary, then do you give us a liſt of your Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals. And alſo for Fundamentals we need not ſuch a Judge, having them with ſufficient plainneſſe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is Infallible. Upon the whole matter then, there is a poſſibility of their erring, without Infallibility, and of our erring without damnation: So that your firſt error is an Infallibility of a Judge; the ſecond, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſuch a Judge; and a third is this, that no Church can prudently be held to be the Catholick Church, but the Roman.</p>
            <p>But ought we not to diſturb your delight, you take in holding a Religion prudently? prudently as if we were to chooſe a Religion by intereſſe, which prudence doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direct to, not by ſapience of the higheſt ſpeculative principles, which direct the underſtanding: but to let that paſſe. We onely note hereby your pronouncing this main Text, for the Authority of the Church, that what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it hath, muſt be reſolved into Scripture, then is that the firſt and higheſt principle. That the center of Truth, wherein we muſt reſt, and the further we go from that, the further from Truth. And the greater circumference we draw, the lines are the remoter from that, wherein we muſt acquieſce, as being the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Yet you ſay here we ſee the Judge, which Chriſt hath warranted from bringing in any damnable error, therefore may we ſecurely obey. So you. But where is your connexion in this argumentation? Either you diſtinguiſh damnative error againſt that which is not damnative, or not. If not, then in your opinion all error is damnative; then take you heed of this, for this is one. Or if you do diſtinguiſh it againſt error damnative, yet may we not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely obey this Judge, becauſe then we may be bound
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40740:99"/> to obey him in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſo ſhould the underſtanding be obliged to aſſent to error, which is impoſſible, and he muſt act againſt his Conſcience, even in his aſſent, which is a contradiction.</p>
            <p>And that none may diſobey this judge ſecurely, the Text you bring <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. will not evince to your p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>poſe. For firſt, it concerns matters of Treſpaſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Brother and Brother, not matters of Faith, and thus it is Eccentrical to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſigne. Secondly, It concerns refractorineſſe of the perſon, not unbelief of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and ſo the Authority of the Church may binde againſt the former, though not againſt the latter. Thirdly It reſpects Excommunication by cenſure, not determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a point by Infallibility, and ſo alſo is not proper to your cauſe. And fourthly, It may erre in the Cenſure, and therefore Excommunication, <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> doth not damne, as Unbelief may. Neither am I bound to believe the Cenſure is juſt, unleſſe it appears to be ſo. Fifthly, This power belongs to every particular Church; and to the ſeveral Prelates thereof (as you ſpeak alſo in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of multitude) and therefore is not appropriated to your Church. Sixthly, It doth not follow, a <hi>fortieri,</hi> as you would have it, nor yet at all, that becauſe the Church is to judge of private complaints, therefore it can judge infallibly in cauſes of greater importance: by its authority it doth the former, without Infallibility it does not the latter. The former of them doth not conclude againſt me, and the latter cannot be from hence collected. As for that which followes, <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven,</hi> as far as it regards Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be alſo taken ſpecificatively, <hi>&amp; clave non er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> as they ſpeak. And this toucheth the perſon unto the ſubmiſſion, not the Conſcience; as to renounce that which it apprehendeth as true: for then ſhould <hi>Athanaſius</hi> have been bound in Conſcience by the Cenſure of the Church to have been an <hi>Arrian.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:40740:99"/>
            <p>Then from the peril of diſobedience to this judge, you gather that this muſt ſuppoſſe the judge not to be fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore prove it thus, and then an infallibility of our knowledge of it, and infallibly what is the ſubject of this Infallibility, and then I ſhall ſtand up to your Creed. And if you would go the right way in this diſpute, you ſhould uſe another method: for whereas you would argue the Church to be the judge, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſafely diſobey; if you could make this ſure (which yet is not done) yet you ſhould rather goe this way ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically, the Church is infallible in whatſoever it doth define, therefore it is the Judge which we ought to obey in all things whatſoever it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:40740:100"/> Infallible. Doth this follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we deny not their Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but their Infallibility. Conclude thus, or you agree with us.</p>

               </gap>y to the Old Teſtament, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. For the <hi>Prieſts lips ſhall keep knowledge, and they ſhall require the law from his mouth.</hi> So you. And you note, beſides a great corruption in our Engliſh, which rendreth the words, <hi>the Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the law.</hi> We need not anſwer that this Text hath nothing for you: Is it meant of the Prieſts at <hi>Rome?</hi> If not, how belongeth it to you? but to the Prieſts of the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what an general? what then do you get by this? Secondly They keep Knowledge ſufficiently for the people. Do they keep it Infallibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If not we are agreed. If infallibly, how are the Prieſts taxed in the following words for not doing ſo? And if the formality of ſpeech doth import a promiſe in the future, not a duty in the Subjunctive: yet the promiſe doth not include an impoſſibility of error; no more then the promiſe made to your Church, as you ſuppoſe, doth exclude all error, but that which is deſtructive. Thirdly, The future in the Hebrew, doth not contradict a ſubjunctive in the interpretation, when the ſcope bears it, ſince the Hebrews, as you may know, have no proper Subjunctive. And it is proper to the ſcope to underſtand it as of duty, they ſhould keep knowledge, whereupon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey are charged for breach of duty, therefore our Interpretation in this, is more ſound then your diſpute upon it.</p>
            <p>And therefore that which you ſay in your 19. Number, that any man may ask the Prieſts of the Church, what is the Known Doctrine of the Church, &amp; then let him reſt ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; when he knowes that, that is unreaſonable becauſe the Prieſts are not Infallible. May he not reſt more ſecurely in Scripture? for the Church in all things is not as before infallible, the Scripture is, in all which it propoſeth: but the Church you ſay, is not in danger of taking in any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40740:100"/> error. Well, but the Scriptures ſets out none at all; but all things are not determined in Scripture. Well, but all things are not determined in the Church; but all things neceſſary are taught in the Church, which may keep us from damnative error. Well, and are not all things neceſſary taught in the Scripture? why then not to the Law and Teſtimony? why to the Ciſtern, when we may have it at the Fountain? why not to the Scripture parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, when what Authority the Church hath, it hath from the Scripture in general? and why doth your Church take away from the people the uſe of Scripture? and why may not we be informed as ſufficiently by our Prieſts, as you by yours, notwithſtanding this Text? eſpecially ſince we go by Scripture, you by Tradition, or humane definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if the Prieſts of yours were Infallible, can you ſay Infallibly that they will not deceive you? How miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably then do you provide for the poor people? when you would have them require at their mouth, not the Law of God, but the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
            <p>That which comes on in the ſame Number about Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition before Scripture, was anſwered before it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Word, in the Subſtance of it, was before the Church which was begotten by it, and when there is now as much need, and as great certainty of Tradition as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, then urge it.</p>
            <p>And I thank you for Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Teſtimony, I do not lye at catch; but the moſt convincing diſpute, is by our Adverſaries principles; not the Fathers but yours, as you apply them, for we can make very good uſe of his words. If the Scripture had not been left to us, we ſhould have had Tradition more certainly conveyed to us, as the Goſpel was before it was written, and this confirmes for me what was ſaid before: but now I aſſume, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is now left to us, therefore is there no need of certain conveyance of Tradition to us. Surely you have a minde to help us for your own good.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:40740:101"/>
            <p>Neither can we believe that thoſe barbarous Nations you ſpeak of, did rely onely upon Tradition, they might be commended to the doctrine of the Goſpel by Tradition, and then not believe it for the ſake of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for this is the ſtate of the queſtion: Tradition in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith unwritten, is of equal authority to Scripture. Secondly, If you ſay Salvation was written in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, this may be meant to be done not onely beſide Scripture, but beſides Tradition, and thus was it done extraordinarily. But why? Thirdly, Might not the Holy Spirit infuſe Faith of the Goſpel into thoſe Nations, by ſome of thoſe who were Apoſtles, or ſent from them to Preach it; and then the Tradition you ſpeak of is the matter of the Goſpel which is written, and ſo it doth not appertain to the queſtion of Traditions of proper name, which you ſay are beſide that which is written, though not againſt it; and then your diſcourſe is fallacious from that which is the object of the Goſpel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, to that which is beſide it delivered, which ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of the word Tradition if it doth deceive you, yet doth it not conſequently deceive me: but if you mean Tradition here, onely of the manner of communicating the matter of Scripture without writing, then the former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may ſatisfie you, that Tradition was then more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and they were more aſſured of it by the Spirit of God then we are now. And alſo it might be to them, as the Star to the Wiſe Men for leading them to Chriſt. By the light of the Star they were guided to Chriſt, but when they came to him, they ſaw him not by the light of the Star, but by the light of the Day: ſo ſome might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Goſpel by Tradition before they had the Scripture, and then believed it by the light of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>You add alſo, neither did the Apoſtles or their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors take any care to have the Scripture communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to all Nations in ſuch Languages, as they could
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40740:101"/> all, or the greater part underſtand. So you.</p>
            <p>This is readily denyed: for God did take care that the New Teſtament ſhould for the moſt part of it at leaſt be firſt written in Greek. And the Greek you know in the notion of the New Teſtament, is contradiſtinguiſhed to the Jew, becauſe ſo many of the world, beſides the Jews, were Greeks; and the Greeks Language was the moſt common then, and therefore ſaith <hi>Tully</hi> in his Oration for the Poet <hi>Archias, Graeca per totum orbem leguntur.</hi> And God by his gracious Providence, hath taken care that the Scripture ſhould be tranſlated into divers languages, as you may know, that ſo ſeveral Nations might have it familiar to them in their own Tongue; which muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your Church, for not permitting of it ordinarily to the people in their own dialect; and alſo doth conclude, that Tradition is no Infallible proviſion for a rule of Faith, for how ſhall the people undoubtedly know that the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were clearly diſcerned, true from them which were falſe; and alſo that they were faithfully handed through ſo many Centuries to the preſent time. And yet if ſo, this would not be ſufficient for your uſe, unleſſe you or others could finde theſe two points more, one how to evade a Circle, by proving the Traditions by the Church, and the Church by the Traditions: and the ſecond this, that thoſe Traditions have Infallibly decided the differences betwixt us, which the Antients did not profeſſedly handle, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not provocations thereunto. If any thing be touched by the by, you may know the rule, <hi>Aliud agentis parva autoritas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In your 20. Number, you make a recapitulation of what you think you have done, and I think you have undone, untill you come to</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I have found a lawful Judge, who can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all Controverſies ariſing from time to time, and who can hear Me and You, and be heard by Me and You: that neither I nor you can doubt of the true meaning of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40740:102"/> this Church, or if we doubt, we can propoſe our doubt, and ſhe will tell us clearly her meaning, whereas the Bible, &amp;c. cannot do ſo.</p>
            <p>This hath in it ſomewhat new: your diſcourſe in brief, may be under this forme. That which can hear you and me, and be heard by you and me, and reſolve doubts of its meaning, is the Judge; the Church can do thus, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture not, therefore the Church is the Judge, and not the Scripture.</p>
            <p>We eaſily anſwer, If you underſtand the propoſition of a formall Judge, ſo we grant it, and do not ſay the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Judge, but if you mean it ſo that nothing can be in any Kind a Judge, but that which doth ſo, we deny it and your aſſumption too; for the Law is in its kind the Judge; and ſo may the Scripture be, as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this paper. And unleſs the Eccleſiaſtick Judges (whereof we do not reject a lawfull and good uſe) doe rightly declare Scripture in the application of it to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cauſes, (wherein the authority of the Church, as ſome of your men will ſometimes ſay, doth conſiſt) I cannot poſſibly hold my ſelf bound in Conſcience to yield my judgement therunto. So then ſecondly, unleſſe you put into the premiſſes, that that which heareth you and me, and is heard by you and me, is the infallible Judge, and then that the Church doth ſo, your diſcourſe is peccant in the ignorance of the Elench, for ſo we grant all as to the Church, for this may ſtand with our cauſe, but if you do put in infallibility, we deny both the one and the other Prepoſition. Thirdly, by this Argument you exclude Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from being the Judge: for doth that hear you and me? Is that heard by you and me? but you ſay the Church doth determine hereby, then may it determine by Scripture more ſecurely, and more univerſally. Fourthly, is not the Heretique Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in his third chapter to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the 10.11. verſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, condemned by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or of himſelf? how that? not by principles of natural
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40740:102"/> Knowledge: for <hi>Theologie</hi> is ſupernatural, and therefore needed a Revelation of it from God, you know not by a Revelation immediate <hi>Extra Scripturam:</hi> for then how ſhould he be condemned of himſelf? Not by any definition of the Church, which was not then ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently formed thereunto: no nor yet by <hi>Titus;</hi> becauſe then as before, he had not been condemned by himſelf; then he was condemned by himſelf, becauſe he had in him the Principles of the Word of God, which he gainſaid by his contrary Error: So that it remains he was condemned by the Law of God. And therefore that can judge you and me; not externally, and by voice: but internally by vertue of Conſcience; which can and does and ſhould apply the truths of God to the cenſure and condemning of Errors in us; ſo that this Scripture it is, or the Word of God which paſſeth Sentence in the interiour judgement, as you ſpeak, and this abſolves ſome who in the outward Courts are condemned; and condemneth ſome who in the outward Court are not condemned. And therefore it is not only lawful, but neceſſary for us ſometimes to diſſent in our judgement, becauſe they may erre in their dijudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>And as much your own reaſon ſuggeſts in your 21. Number; wherein you acknowledge it to be neceſſary that there ſhould be infallibilitie in the Judge of faith; And then you would ſtate or eſtate this infallibility of the Church of Chriſt thus, that a Pope defining with a Lawful Generall Councill cannot erre. For it is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary article of faith to believe that the Pope or Head of the Church cannot Erre when he defineth without a Generall Councill. So you.</p>
            <p>Alas, Sir what Cautions do you ſtand in need of in this grand and capital and Comprehenſive Controverſie; which affords me Liberty to think, that that is not the ground of Catholique Faith, which is intricated with ſo many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and guarded with ſuch accurateneſs of Cautions,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40740:103"/> that render it very ſuſpicious; and therefore not to be plain and a direct way ſo that fools cannot erre: for who can be certain by a Divine Faith of the Lawfullneſs and regularitie of your Pope in his Creation, and when there was Pope againſt Pope, who of the people could diſtinguiſh the right? And this is now poſſible becauſe then <hi>in facto.</hi> And who then could decide the queſtion: for the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible judge you ſay is your Pope with a Council. Which of them could then determine it and in his own cauſe? Or could your Council determine it without a Pope? but I hope your infallible determination could not be without the Head of the Church; And who according to your Doctrine, ſhould call the Council? for you ſay that power is veſted in the Pope; Well, ſuppoſe no doubt of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie of the Pope; how ſhall we by a Divine faith come to be aſſured of the lawfulneſs and Generality of a Councill? for you know Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory is full of inſtances of Councils, which were called by the Emperours and not by Popes, to whom you ſay it doth of due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to call Councils; elſe they are not lawful. And how ſhall we know whether every one of the Council hath a free Election to it, and a free deciſive vote in it? How much of faction may be looked for in a Councill, when there is ſo much in the Election of a Pope; ſuch excluſions, ſuch bandyings? What Council was ever called by a Pope wherein Religion was not made to ſerve his intereſt? Is not he who hath power of preferring like to domineer in ſuch Conſultations? And how ſhall ignorant ſouls be divinely perſwaded that the Council i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> General? If it be eaſie to diſcern it, then had your <hi>Tren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Council great infelicity to be ſo contradicted by the <hi>French</hi> Catholiques. And how many Biſhops in the <hi>Trent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil furniſhed with a Title to overpower them with Votes on the Popes behalf. So that he anſwered well who ſaid about the queſtion which is ſuperiour, a Pope or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; a Pope was like to have the more voyces, becauſe he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40740:103"/> could confer Biſhopricks, a Council not. What clue can a collier have infallibly to guide him through all thoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths?</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the infallible Judge of Faith be the Pope with a lawful General Council, how was the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for? when for ſo many years there was neither Pope in your ſenſe, nor any Council?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Pope and the Council do differ about a Queſtion, what ſhall be done in that caſe? yet if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be which is ſuperiour to the other, the Pope or the Council, what ſhall be joyntly agreed? and is not this a main queſtion between the Sorboniſts and others?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the Pope with a lawful General Council be the infallible Judge, then how will this be reconciled to the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> who aſſert the Government of the Church to be Monarchical by Chriſts Inſtitution: for if part of the authority be in the General Council, then is it not all in one, the Pope. Or if the Council be called onely <hi>ad Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> and they have no Votes deciſive, how doth this agree to all the former Councils, wherein they had authority of Vote; and he may determine without them as to adviſe, ſince he determins without them in the authority; and ſuppoſe they adviſe him to let them have power of Vote; he can yet determine againſt them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, How many Councils have been oppoſite to one another. In which or with which did not the Pope erre? The <hi>Nicene</hi> and that of <hi>Ariminum</hi> as before decreed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily; one for the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the former againſt them, which did not erre, and yet if neither had, did ever any of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councils determine of their own infallibility?</p>
            <p>And what think you of <hi>Nazianzens</hi> Opinion about Councils, in his Epiſtle, to <hi>Procopius,</hi> the 42. Shall I tell you it? I have no mind to derogate from General Councils, but if you would have me tell you his judgement, it is in ſuch words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am thus affected, as to ſhun all meetings of Biſhops (if I muſt ſpeak the truth)
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40740:104"/> for I never ſaw any Good end of a Synod, nor that had an end of the Evils more then an addition. Nay, did not the Biſhop of <hi>Bit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto</hi> break out into theſe words in the face of the Council at <hi>Trent; I would that with one conſent, we had not altogether declined from Religion, to ſuperſtition, from Faith unto infidelitie from Chriſt unto Antichriſt, from God to</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus. Did he not ſay ſo?</p>
            <p>And this may ſerve for your Anſwer to all the reſt of this your Paragraph. We cannot think it ſtrange that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a General Council ſhould be fallible, until you bring forth your ſtrong reaſons to induce my aſſent, that ſuch aſſiſtance was ever promiſed to a General Council, as the Apoſtles and Prophets had; or that any General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had ſuch aſſiſtance; or that there was the ſame reaſon of ſuch aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>And to ſay no more of this point, meaſure the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council by the determinations thereof in things of Religion, and ſee how they agree with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which you ſay is a rule of Faith: and by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be you judge of the infallible Judge. Let us not ſee your Opinions by infallibility which you pretend: but do you ſee your infallibility by the determinations it did put forth; namely ſuch wherein we differ, and therefore I need not name them.</p>
            <p>In the 22. Paragraph we have recapitulation, and a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Luther,</hi> which you uſe as an Argument <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Anſwer, you do then hereby give us occaſion to ſhew our ingenuity to truth, that as we follow him and any other with it, ſo we will not follow others or him without it. But ſecondly, If this book was written after his receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is not meant of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, but of the Catholique Church; which yet he doth not here compare with the Scripture, but with a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man; which ſeems to be ſpoken againſt <hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi> Neither doth he ſay that it is not lawful to doubt of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40740:104"/> Church that whatſoever it ſaith is true; but that it hath the Revelation of the Father; to wit becauſe it hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Word of God with it. Or that the undoubtedneſſe of it doth not belong to it <hi>per ſe,</hi> but <hi>per aliud,</hi> becauſe it hath for its priviledge the Revelation of Scripture; And thus it maketh not for you.</p>
            <p>Now this brings on your forecited paſſage of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.15. Where the Church of God is called <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you aske, <hi>May not men rely ſecurely upon the pillar of Truth? May they not ground themſelves aſſuredly on the ground of Truth? no ground being ſurer ground and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible then the ground of Truth it ſelf?</hi> So you;</p>
            <p>Suppoſing the words read according to this way, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; There is a double Pillar, and a double ground; one Principal, the Scripture; the other leſſe principal and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, the Church; now as this pillar and this ground is ſubordinate to the main pillar and ground, we may rely and ground our ſelves: but then the principal reliance and grounding muſt be upon that which is principal, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For let me ask you likewiſe, what is the Pillar and Ground of the Church? Is it not the Scripture? then the Church is but the pillar and ground by accident, becauſe that doth rely and is grounded upon the Scripture. And therefore the Scripture is the more ſure and infallible ground: becauſe what truth the Church hath it hath by participation, and it is poſſible for it to hold forth and to have hung upon it ſomwehat which is falſe, according to your own confeſſion (as I conceive you) although not damnative. And this doth well corroborate my infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> words of the Scriptures being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Pillar and Ground of Truth; that therefore it is the Ground of Faith, yes very rationally, becauſe it is the prime and ſupreme pillar and ground of Truth. Yet you will raiſe a conſequence upon mine for your cauſe, thus. If this conſequence be ſtrong (which I deny not) there is yet
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40740:105"/> a ſtronger, that the Truth is no where ſurer grounded then upon the pillar and foundation of Truth. So you.</p>
            <p>Sir, What do you mean? Do you make any difference betwixt the ground and foundation? Do you mean that the Scripture is the ground of Faith, but the Church is the Foundation? This is your ſenſe I ſuppoſe, otherwiſe how a ſtronger Conſequence? For there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, but where there is ſome difference. And if this be what you would have, then I think I may ſay, I have what I would have, and yet we are not agreed. For then you confeſſe what I have hitherto held, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the ground of Faith. You ſaid at firſt that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church was the ground of Faith: I ſaid the Scripture was the ground of Faith; and now you ſay as I ſay, that the Scripture is the ground of Faith, and ſo your contradiction is come into my affirmation. But yet we are not agreed in that which you now ſuperadd, that the Church is the Foundation of Truth; the Scripture is the Ground, the Church the Foundation. Is it ſo? then have you changed the Queſtion. And why had we not the right ſtate of it at firſt? And was it not enough that the Church ſhould be the ground of Scripture, but muſt it be the Foundation in a more excellent ſenſe? I muſt not let this paſſe for your ſake.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what gives you occaſion from the Text to aſſert the Church to be the Foundation, <hi>ſignanter,</hi> I do not ſee. For the word in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth not ſignifie a Foundation, but that which doth uphold, ſupport againſt falling; and therefore, <hi>Iſidor Clarius</hi> and <hi>Eſtius</hi> doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it by <hi>firmamentum,</hi> not <hi>fundamentum.</hi> So the Church holds forth, and holds up the Truth. Therefore your meaning of Foundation above ground, hath neither Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation nor ground.</p>
            <p>Secondly, can you conceive and ſay, that the Church is a Foundation of Truth comparatively to Scripture? Is not the Scripture the Foundation of the Church: The Scripture
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40740:105"/> in the ſubſtance of the Word, was before the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church was built upon it; then the Scripture in the ſubſtance of it, was the Foundation, and is now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written. And that which is the firſt Principle of all muſt be the Foundation of the reſt; and the further we go from it, the leſſe ſecurity we have, becauſe we go more into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which is uncertain. Now, the firſt Principle is Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, not the Church; becauſe the Church is proved by Scripture, and you proved even now, or would have done, the authority of it by Scripture. The Church may give Teſtimony of the Scripture: but the Scripture doth not onely give Teſtimony of the Church, but doth ground it, and conſtitute it, and diſtinguiſh it, and upon it, it is built, then this is the Foundation. The Church is built upon the Scripture, not the Scripture upon the Church. As the Law hath it ſelf to Juſtice, ſo hath the Scripture it ſelf to Faith. Now the Law is the Foundation of Juſtice, not the Judge: ſo is the Scripture the Foundation of Faith, not the Church, which you ſay is the Judge. For as the Judge is built upon the Law, ſo is the Church upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And as the Judge is to go by the Law in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and ſentence, otherwiſe he erres; ſo is the Church to go by the Law of Scripture, otherwiſe it doth erre. And as the Law is not to be proved, it being the firſt Principle in Juſtice, ſo is not the Scripture to be proved; for it is the firſt principle in Faith. But as the ſentence of the Judge may be examined by Law, ſo may the determinations of the Church be examined by Scripture, ſince the Judge may erre, and ſo may the Church. But firſt prove that it hath not erred, and then you will have another work to do to prove it cannot: For the Faith of a Chriſtian immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately is reſolved into that which cannot deceive him. And prove that it cannot erre, and therefore is the infallible Judge; or if you can, prove it the back way; it is the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible judge, therefore cannot erre.</p>
            <p>Nextly, You make ſome perſtriction of my Criticiſme
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40740:106"/> (if it may be ſo called) and yet not mine neither, but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo; whereby the termes, the Pillar and Ground of Truth, is referred to the commendation of the Myſtery of Godlineſſe, after the <hi>Hebrew</hi> faſhion, to give theſe Praefaces of reſpect to ſo grand and ſublime doctrines.</p>
            <p>Here you are pleaſed to ſmile, as if I had forgotten that this Epiſtle was written in <hi>Greek,</hi> not in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and alſo you ſay no <hi>Hebrew</hi> form in the world can make that ſenſe he intends.</p>
            <p>Sir, Will you pleaſe to give me leave to be even with you in a ſmile: but no, I have no minde to rejoyce in any mans imperfections. Soberly I reply, that I do well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in what Language it was written, and therefore I make it to be an Ebraiſme, in our uſe of the word, which ſpeaks a following of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> form in ſome other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And he that doth not underſtand that there is many of theſe Ebraiſmes in the Greek of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not underſtand ſo much as I would deſire. And therefore, that which you ſay, that no Hebrew form can make my ſenſe, is not to be anſwered. And to follow you, although the Apoſtle had not ſpoken yet of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, or the myſtery of it, might he not put this form of commendation in the front of the Doctrine of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? as as alſo in the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Neither have you any cauſe to object the reading of the words in our Engliſh, ſince the diſtinction of Verſes is not Canonical, nor yet our Engliſh ſo accounted by us; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we have as much reaſon for it, to make it as good as your Latin.</p>
            <p>But your Adverſary ſayes, you ſay, that this Title of being the Pillar and ground of Truth, agrees in the firſt place to Scripture. Yes, and ſo I do ſtill, and have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſo: but you ſay it belongeth equally to any thing that is the true Word of God, and therefore agreeth to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40740:106"/> the Scriptures, becauſe God ſpeaketh in it; and by it. Right, hold you there. Reſt your ſelf here. Set up your ſtaffe here, for you can go no further, unleſſe you will go up to Heaven, and the Church Triumphant.</p>
            <p>But God alſo ſpeaketh by his Church, and in his Church; yes, unto Authority, not Infallibility, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which followes, remaines to be proved by you; that he doth give as much Infallible aſſiſtance to the Church in a Council (where is the Pope? have you a minde to the opinion of the French Catholiques?) as he gave to him who did deliver his Word in Scripture. It is utterly denyed. And you may ſee plainly hereby how the Roman Tyranny over your Conſcience (as they would perſwade you) draws you neceſſarily into this perill of Blaſphemy: for herein it appears, that now there is no need of Scripture, ſince God ſpeaks as Infallibly by his Church, as in his Word. And this ſome <hi>Pontificians</hi> do lean towards. And then thoſe by you ſhould be called <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts,</hi> not who oppoſe a private Revelation to Scripture, but to the Church; if God ſpeaks as infallibly by his Church, then ſpeak no more againſt <hi>Enthuſiaſmes,</hi> or if you do, we ſhall tell you the ſtory, that one was accuſed to <hi>Alexander</hi> for being a Pirate; ſo then ſaid he that was accuſed to <hi>Alexander,</hi> I am a Pirate with one Fly-boat, and you are not, becauſe you have a Navy. So the private men are by you accounted <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> becauſe they have but their own ſingularities for their bottom: but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not to be charged therewith, becauſe they have ſo many with them. And yet it may be, if Infallibility were to be determined by Votes, whether it did belong to the Words of God onely, or alſo to the Word of the Church, you would go neer to loſe it; for all Churches hold the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Infallible, and you too: but no Church but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man holds the Church to be Infallible, and then alſo you muſt aſſume that you are the Church, otherwiſe you would not hold it Infallible.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:40740:107"/>
            <p>You ſay again, it is objected, that in theſe words, rather the office of the Church is ſet forth then her Authority. To which you ſay, your anſwer is clear, that her Authority cannot poſſibly in ſhort words be more ſet out, then by ſaying that ſhe is the Pillar and Ground of Truth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion is, whether theſe words be intended to that purpoſe, ſince alſo the words do in ſhort fully repreſent the office of the Church: the intention of the paſſage muſt be gathered by the ſcope, according to the rule of the Schoolman, <hi>Intelligentia dicti colligitur ex ſcopo loquendi.</hi> Now the drift of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> was to inſtruct him how he ſhould carry himſelf in the Church. Was it reaſonable then he ſhould have account of the Church in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of it, or in the duty thereof; which is to hold forth, and uphold truth? For if the Infallibility of the Church were here affirmed, then needed he not to have ſuch inſtructions to take care how he behaved himſelf in the Church. Since Infallible aſſiſtance is immediate, and that which is immediate, includes no time for the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor means of inſtruction: therefore had your Roman Church been real in the aſſerting of Infallibility, it had not needed eighteen years for the ſitting of the <hi>Trent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, with Intermiſſions, nor more for the conſultation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhould be any.</p>
            <p>As for that which comes next of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> it was in part anſwered before: the Argument is this, the Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality of the Son is by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> after the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> called that Word of God, by the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> which remaineth for ever and ever. And this is no where clearly ſaid in Scripture, therefore ſomewhat which is not clearly ſaid in Scripture, may by a Council be determined to be the Word of God. To this we anſwer, we may grant you all of the Syllogiſm, and yet nothing accrews to you, if the words by the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> be underſtood miniſterially to Scripture, which they were bound to declare the ſenſe of, as to that point,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40740:107"/> and ſo it did not binde with relation to their Authority, but by Authority of Scripture, which they declared the mind of in that caſe. And therefore though ſo we grant the Argument, yet do we deny your Conſequence which you would make of it in your ſenſe, that the Church is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the definitions of it, ſince that which was defined was indeed Infallible, and yet was not Infallibly defined: for though the Council did not erre in that definition, yet it might have erred: and if it did not erre in that, yet it might erre in other definitions: and therefore can we not without ſuſpenſe, intuitively receive what they propoſe as the Word of God, which is by you yet to be proved. For ſecondly, That which they have the Principles and Grounds of Scripture for, it is more eaſie for them rightly to define, in the Application of thoſe principles unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes, as they had for that queſtion about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiality of the Son, as Saint <hi>John</hi> the 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not one Perſon, but one in Nature: but as for thoſe queſtions, whereof the ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not ſo principled in Scripture, as being not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be held on either part; we cannot expect ſo likely a determination, and yet if probable, we cannot from thence urge it as an object of Faith. That which is in Scripture, according to equivalence of ſenſe (as that point is) we may better credit upon account of Scripture, then that which the ignorance of doth not damn, ſince the Scripture gives us no moments of knowledge how to order our aſſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively or negatively in that.</p>
            <p>But thirdly Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did not ground his Faith in the affirmative of that queſtion upon the authority of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> becauſe he held it before the Council had determined it, and therefore the cauſe of his Faith herein, was not the authority of the Council. And if that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> was to be believed for it ſelfe, without reſpect to the matter, as depending upon Scripture, why not the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> to the contrary; and therefore Saint
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40740:108"/> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> would refer it to Scripture betwixt him &amp; <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> a Biſhop of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> ſince the Councils was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And if any exception could have been made againſt the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> as towards the denial of ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it as is due to other Councils, had it not been eaſie for the Father to have held the Doctrine upon the Authority of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> though the other had been rejected?</p>
            <p>In your 23. Number, you do not fairly render my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. I did not ſay that Chriſt would not be at all with his Church to the end of the world: but it is not neceſſarily there meant, that he would be with them unto the end of the world, as he was with the Apoſtles by Infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo he did not promiſe he would be with the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the Apoſtles. And therefore if this be a ſimple miſtake, it is a fallacy a <hi>dicto ſecundum quid:</hi> if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a ſlander, it is worſe. Infallible aſſiſtance is not there promiſed, and therefore the promiſe may be made good without it. Neither was there ſuch need of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſiſtance (whatſoever you ſay) becauſe the rule of Faith and Manners was to be determined in the Scripture, which is the Infallible Word of God. So that although they who followed the Apoſtles in the governance of the Church, had been ſo diſpoſed for Infallible aſſiſtance, as the Apoſtles, yet had there not been that uſe of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance Infallible; but having not that diſpoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they wanted a condition and qualification for ſuch aſſiſtance. And God did not give an Infallible aſſiſtance to the Apoſtles, becauſe they were diſpoſed for that gift of Infallibility, but rather gave them that diſpoſition, that ſo they might be fitted for that Infallibility. And ſo if he had intended ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit to the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, as to them, he could have made them as capable thereof.</p>
            <p>As for your Reaſon which you mention of leaving as ſecure direction for them (who followed) becauſe the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40740:108"/> we go from Chriſts time, the more we are ſubject to uncertainty about his Doctrine; therefore there is as much yea far more reaſon (of this ſecure direction.) I anſwer, You do not well conſider what you ſay. For if we be more ſubject to uncertainties, the further we goe from Chriſt his time, then cannot you urge the credit of thoſe Traditions now equally to the certainty of them then: ſuppoſing that there were any of Faith not written. Secondly, this Reaſon would be none, if men would be guided by Scripture, which hath now the ſame certainty as ever. This is a Rule which will with equal infallibility hold at all times; and unto which we are all equally obliged.</p>
            <p>Again, you would argue that the Church is ſecure from damnable errour, becauſe Chriſt promiſed to be with it to the end of the world, and he is not with thoſe who live in damnable errour.</p>
            <p>But what is this to me? you may conclude thus, and yet not againſt me, if you ſpeak of damnable errour ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: for if you mean it reduplicatively, that all errour is damnable, <hi>Ut ſic, quatenus errer,</hi> it is falſe. All ſimple errour is not damnative to the perſon. And therefore Chriſt may be with ſome who live in ſome errour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed otherwiſe with whom is he? For who is there that lives not in ſome errour, though he knows it not? If you mean then damnable errour diſtinctively, I grant you all; and yet you have nothing thereby for your cauſe. For this doth not prove infallibility to your Church. Security from damnable errour (diſtinctively taken) doth not infer abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute infallibility. The former is promiſed, as alſo in that of Saint <hi>John.</hi> 14.16. (which you would reinforce here;) but abſolute infallibility is not intended. And this you muſt have, or elſe you are utterly loſt. For if the Church be not infallible in all that is propoſed by it, how ſhall I be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of any particular thing which it propoſeth? If I be not aſſured of this particular, how am I bound to believe it? If I be not bound to beleeve it upon its propoſal, how is it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40740:109"/> the ground of Faith Divine? If it be not the ground of Faith Divine, then you are gone. And beſides thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> you may know were made as to the Apoſtles equally, and therefore to their ſucceſſours equally; and to the Church univerſal equally, by conſequent; and therefore cannot you appropriate it to your Biſhop and to your Church.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> authority in a paſſage of his, wherein you ſay he ſpeaks admirably in this <hi>De utilitate credendi,</hi> cap 6. you had better have omitted. It ſtrengthens your cauſe nothing, if you quote it as you ſhould. Firſt it is miſquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the chapter, for it is not in the 6. chapter, but in the 16. Secondly, you may ſee in the beginning of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the ſcope of it is to ſhew how authority may firſt move to Faith. And Thirdly, this ſcope may diſcover your corrupting of his Text; for it is not as you give it, a certain ſtep, but contrary, an uncertain ſtep, <hi>velut gradu incerto innitentes;</hi> as in the <hi>Froben</hi> Edition, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>N. M. D.</hi> lxix. Whereby you may perceive how little reaſon we have to credit your infallibility. And then Fourthly, part of his authority in that chapter, is by miracles of Chriſt which he did himſelf on earth.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of your fourth Number is this, to perſwade not onely that the Churches authority is infallible if it judge conformably to Scripture; for ſo even the Devil himſelf is infallible ſo long as he teacheth conformably to Scriptures: but that the Church ſhall at no time teach any thing that in any damnable errour ſhall be againſt Scripture: So that when we know this is her Doctrine, we are ſure that this is conformable to the Scriptures right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood. And this you would prove by two Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture.</p>
            <p>We anſwer diſtinctly, and Firſt to that you ſay about the Devil. Firſt, we are not commanded but forbidden to conſult with the Devil: but we are injoyned to conſult with the Church of God. Secondly, we have cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40740:109"/> to ſuſpect the Devil, becauſe either he doth not give us all the Scripture unto a particular, or doth pervert it; or doth ſpeak the truth with an intention of deceiving the more: but we have more charity towards the Church, we have none towards the Devill. Thirdly, Yet though we do not believe the Devil in point of truth, upon his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; nevertheleſſe can we not believe the Church in whatſoever it ſayes to be true upon its authority: neither doth it follow, that the Devil ſhould hereupon be the pillar and ground of Truth, when he ſaid that which is conformable to Scripture, as well as the Church, becauſe the Church doth hold and uphold Truth: ſo doth not the Devil, but when he uſeth it, he doth it to deſtroy it: and again we are moved to think that which is propoſed by the Church to be true, ſo are we not moved by the Devil to conceive it to be true upon his ſaying ſo. And therefore if I do believe that, which the Devil ſaith conformable to Scripture, to be true; and do not beleeve that every thing which is ſaid by the Church to be conformable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I do not make the ſame account of what is ſaid by one and by the other. For that which is true I doe beleeve becauſe it is ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, though the Devil ſaith it: I do beleeve it in reſpect to the matter without any reſpect to the Author; and that which is not true according to Scripture, I cannot beleeve though the Church ſaith it; yet am I moved by the authority of the Church to conſider the point more, becauſe it is propoſed by them: and what is by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed according to Scripture I am moved to beleeve of, with reſpect of the Authour of the propoſal: but cannot be reſolved in my Faith of, but by the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And therefore I cannot beleeve that whatſoever is ſaid by the Church is agreable to Scripture, becauſe the Church faith it: for this propoſition, for ought as yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is not agreable to Scripture rightly underſtood. And if you ſay that your Church muſt judge the ſenſe, let it firſt judge whether it doth not beg the principle.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:40740:110"/>
            <p>Neither have your Texts alledged any thing for you. Not that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the 2. chapter, the 44. verſe. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects indeed the Kingdome of Chriſt in general, and therefore is not proper to any Church of his <hi>ſigna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter,</hi> for any thing can be ſhewed by the Text. Secondly, The Kingdome of Chriſt principally reſpects the Church invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which as ſuch is not our guide. Thirdly, it may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to its everlaſting reign in Heaven, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome errour on earth by the Church viſible. Fourthly, whereas you ſay it ſhall deſtroy all Idolatrous kingdomes, you doe very well add in your Parentheſis [Idolatrous Kingdomes] to ſave your ſelves from ſuſpition. But it all Idolatrous Kingdomes, then have you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make your infallibilitie more ſtrongly infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; otherwiſe you will be included in this diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>So alſo that of <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.21. profits you nothing, ſome of the former anſwers may ſerve; it principally is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Church inviſible, which by the Church viſible may ſufficiently be directed through the means of grace to ſalvation infallibly, without infallibility of the Church. As the Word of God was certain before it was written, and the Church then was by it directed, becauſe it was then in ſubſtance of it though not written (as we have ſaid before, but you compell us to repeat) ſo by the Word written in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, though not infallibly expounded and applied by the Paſtours of the Church, ſhall the Church be brought to Life. For if every evil action doth not deſtroy the ſtate of ſalvation, as you will confeſſe: then ſurely every ſimple errour cannot, becauſe it is not voluntary. And this is fully able to anſwer your Appendix to this Number at the end of your paper. Thoſe Teſtimonies (if they be rightly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) yet in thoſe terms affirm no more then that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church ſhall not periſh, which is true, although the viſible Church be under a poſſibilitie to erre, ſince every errour is not deſtructive of ſalvation.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:40740:110"/>
            <p>In the 25. Number, you tell me what you have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but that you have given me ſome additional Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the ſupplement of the laſt, which have their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, without repetition. Onely you no where I think find that Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> did receive all thoſe books which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for Canonical; and for thoſe Authours which held the Conſubſtantiality of the Son, and thoſe ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Holy Trinity, you will give me leave with judicious men to ſuſpect <hi>Euſebius.</hi> Beleeve your Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal herein, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his <hi>De Scriptoribus Eccleſiaſticis, p.</hi> 94.5, 6. where he brings the atteſtation of Saint <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> and Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; and Saint <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> calls him not onely an <hi>Arrian,</hi> but the Prince of the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſometimes; ſometimes the Enſign-bearer. Yea the 7. Synod, he ſayes, and the Apoſtolical Legats rejected his authority, as being an <hi>Arrian</hi> Heretique as he ſaies. And as for <hi>Auſtins</hi> expreſſion, that the relying on the Church's authority is the moſt true and inviolable Rule of Faith you refer it to your 16. Number, and there referre me to the 13. chapter of the firſt book <hi>Contra Creſconium,</hi> which I cannot ſee there. If it ſhould be ſo diſertly, yet this muſt be underſtood reſpectively to thoſe caſes wherein the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not clearly paſſe the Verdict; in which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, is the beſt rule we can then have as towards practice. But this in his Opinion doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely leave us to follow Tradition of the Church in points of Faith, unleſſe he contradicts himſelf, as you ſhall ſee at the end. But you are afraid of want of Number to make noiſe, becauſe you ſay, I ſaid you had no other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony but Saint <hi>Auſtins.</hi> I did not ſay that you had none but his, abſolutely, but you had none but his that I could ſee of thoſe you produced. Neither him indeed if you pleaſe to tell us what you ſee.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ſhall look over your reinforcing his, and the main teſtimony for your cauſe; in my anſwer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I ſee yet no place for amendments or abatement.

And alſo by the way let me obſerve ſomewhat from thoſe two places towards the main queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides the uſe of them in the way of Criticiſme. For
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40740:111"/> by the former you have the reaſon why the Tradition of the Church in Doctrines received, will not make an end of our differences, ſince the queſtions were not then ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and alſo by the ſecond you may obſerve, that we cannot ſwallow all that was ſaid by Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> without chewing, ſince he ſayes himſelf, that had he been ſo well inſtructed, he would not have ſaid this and that. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his books of Retractations are books againſt you; and do conclude wholly, that we are not to take whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fathers wrote to be as true as Goſpel. Yea, ſome ſuch books of Retractations all of them might have made, as ſome think <hi>Origen</hi> did, although they are periſhed as to us.</p>
            <p>But the anſwers which I gave you to that paſſage of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> will not content you. Therefore you ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew at large that they will not ſerve. You ſay unleſſe he will ſtand to that ground, he muſt needs ſeem to ſay nothing againſt his Adverſary. What ground do you mean? VVhat that he was moved by the Churches Infallible Authority, as you would conclude at every turn. No, ſuppoſing him not to ſpeak <hi>in aeſtu Sermonis,</hi> yet what he ſaid againſt his Adverſary was reaſonable, without urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Infallible authority. For the conſent of the Church might be conſidered by him as a condition towards the reception of any doctrine; and yet not to be that which he built his Faith upon, as upon an Infallible ground. You may know the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> is not a cauſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch a thing be not without it, yet is not this the cauſe thereof. And therefore make what you can of the place, it will not afford you a firm foundation, if his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could do it. You ſay that this is his firſt argument, to ſhew that his Adverſary, by citing Texts out of the Goſpel to prove <hi>Manichaeus</hi> a true Apoſtle, could prove nothing againſt thoſe, who as yet have not believed the Goſpel. So you.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and what then? Becauſe the Adverſary
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40740:112"/> can prove nothing by Scripture to thoſe that deny it, therefore Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> muſt infer, that the authority of the Church is infallible, and he muſt believe the Goſpel upon no other ground. VVhat conſequence is this? as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> adverſary cared not for the judgement of the Church, therefore we muſt be guilty of that which is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>You go on in your Paraphraſtical diſcourſe. But becauſe I am not one who have not yet believed the Goſpel, and ſo this anſwer cannot ſerve me; notwithſtanding I muſt tell you that I am ſuch an one, that I would not believe the Goſpel without the authority of the Catholick Church did move me. So you. Out of which words of your own, you may learn how to underſtand the ſenſe and tenſe of the Father in the place: <hi>But becauſe I am not one who have not yet believed the Goſpel;</hi> then he had believed the Goſpel before, and was not to believe it now, and therefore his words muſt be referred in the <hi>African</hi> idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, unto the time more then imperfect, otherwiſe what he had believed, he was to believe now, which cannot ſtand with your Infallibility. And yet you ſay afterwards, mark if his ground be not ſo as I told you; becauſe (ſaith he) I have believed the Goſpel it ſelf upon the preaching of the Catholiques; therefore if his Adverſary ſhould ſay, do not believe the Catholicks, he doth not go conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to force him by the Goſpel to any Faith to <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus.</hi> And hereupon you break out in theſe words, <hi>Can he more clearly ground upon the Infallible Authority of their Teaching, then upon this to believe the Goſpel it ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Again theſe words do not include a Divine Faith of the Infallibility of the Church, which you muſt have, or elſe your cauſe is ſtarved. Becauſe thoſe words, <hi>I would not believe the Goſpel, unleſſe the authority of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church did move me</hi> which muſt be the principal ground, do not include his Faith of the Infallibility of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40740:112"/> Church. He might be moved by the authority of the Church, though not reſolved in his Faith by the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity pretended, &amp; according to this proportion muſt all his diſcourſe be underſtood, which proceeds from his belief of the Goſpel by them, to his being perſwaded by them to Manichaeiſm, if any thing ſhould be found in the Goſpel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, or elſe proceeds to his not believing of <hi>Manichae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> upon his belief of the Catholicks, who bad him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel and not <hi>Manichaus.</hi> Theſe muſt be the hinges upon which the whole diſputation muſt turn, and therefore if thoſe words be not underſtood of an ultimate determination of his Faith by the authority of the Church, but of an inſtrumental moving, nothing will be concluded ſufficient and ſufficiently for you. But this anſwer you give not me any return to. Ponder it very well, for its importance in this debate. For if the whole chapter was ſoberly ſpoken; and if that he did not ſpeak of himſelf, as when he was a <hi>Manichaeu,</hi> yet if he here intends to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more then onely the authority of the Church was an impulſive to the belief of the Goſpel, you will evince no more then what you need not contend for, becauſe we do not contend againſt it, as being not the ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Therefore it remains for you to prove your ſuppoſition, or your proofs of an Infallible authority of the Church, which indeed you would put in, in your concluſions, but is wanting in the premiſes. And if it did belong to me to diſpute, it were not difficult to ſhew the contrary. And ſince they may come in upon account of the reaſon of my denial, they ſhall be there two moments from the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe he ſaith he did believe the Goſpel <hi>per illos,</hi> not <hi>propter.</hi> Now what we do properly believe any one in, we muſt believe for him, not by him; for him as a cauſe, not by him as an inſtrument; and therefore we believe what God ſayes to be true, not by him, but for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40740:113"/> him. And if the Apoſtles, as he ſayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.14. then were not thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks he ſpeaks of ſuch, as he ought, for themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe in ſeveral places of the chapter, he doth ſignifie, that if any reaſon could be given, or any thing whereby it might be manifeſtly known, that his Adverſary were in the right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would leave his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Now this is not ſpoken conſiſtently to the nature of Faith, upon Infallible authority: for what we do believe in way of Faith, we do ſo believe, as there cannot be a falſity in it, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth confeſſe, and I ſuppoſe you too (for you would conclude, no falſity or error can be in any thing, which the Church doth define, becauſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) and therefore all the Reaſon, and all the Science in the world, are not able to ſhake Faith, whereunto the contrary is intimated in the Father. Nay, if there be no arguing to the principles of Faith, from other principles, but from the principles of Scripture, there is arguing to Divine concluſions; then aſſuredly Faith in principles of Theology (as this is one, the verity of the Goſpel) is not obnoxious to any decay by any reaſons. And it ſeems his Faith then in the Goſpel, was not Divine, upon the conſideration of their authority, ſince Reaſon may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid againſt Humane authority, but not Divine: ſo that had he meant, he built his Faith of the Goſpel, upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority infallible of the Church, there had been no place for Reaſon to have any power of aſſent on the behalf of the <hi>Manichees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if you hold to the Goſpel, my hold ſhall ſtill be to the authority of the Church, upon whoſe authority I believed the Goſpel. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will hold my ſelf to thoſe, by whoſe teaching, I have believed the Goſpel, and there commanding me, I will not believe thee.</hi> So you think that this is alſo available for you: ſurely nothing leſſe: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, you omit much of his connexion that makes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40740:113"/> for my former argument, and alſo that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>But you go on. And Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> goeth on ſo far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground as a ground Infallible. What, of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is again denyed, not onely ſimply but it is denyed to be held ſo by him in this diſcourſe. If you may have your ſuppoſitions, we muſt needs ſoon have done.</p>
            <p>Well, go on. That he ſaith, if perhaps you <hi>Manicha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aith. And what can you make of this for your uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take it by it ſelfe and it will come to this, that a clear place in the Goſpel would perſwade him to leſſen his opinion of the authority of the Catholicks: then he would hold clear Scripture above, or againſt the authority of the Church, then their authority is not in his judgement Infallible: or elſe Infallible authority of the Church may be oppoſite to Infallible authority of the Scripture; and one in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, (the Scripture) is more Infallible then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (the Church) which is incongruous; for in Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there is no degree, no more then in Truth. And if you ſay that the Scripture yet may be more Infallible to him; this ſpoyls all your cauſe, for you ſay you go to Faith by the Church, becauſe that way is more plain &amp;c manifeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:40740:114"/>
            <p>Therefore you haſten me from this paſſage to ſhew me what will follow. But what do you think will follow? I pray note it well their authority being weakned (and ſhewed once fallible) now neither can I ſo much as believe the Goſpel. And why ſo? becauſe upon the authority of theſe Catholicks I had believed the Goſpel. So you.</p>
            <p>But do you ſee how you interpoſe your gloſſe in your Parentheſis, thus; their authority being once weakned, and ſhewed once fallible. Do you imagine that we can neglect or overlook this your gloſſall inference or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhewed once fallible: as if there were no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but that which is Infallible, and there were no weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of authority, but to make it fallible. Authority may ſtand with Fallibility, for we grant Authority to the Church, diſtinguiſhing it from Infallibility. And if you had done ſo, you had ſaved many a wound, which your Church hath got by that unfortunate word, <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as one of your own men happily confeſſed. Neither there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth it follow, that the authority of the Catholicks being weakned and ſhewed once fallible, he could not at all believe the Goſpel, becauſe by the authority of the Catholicks, he had believed the Goſpel; but he could not then believe the Goſpel by that inductive and motive of the authority of the Church: for the firſt, Chriſtians believed the Apoſtles ſeverally, without the authority of the Church. Yea, if upon that conſideration he could not have believed the Goſpel, their authority, by whom he did believe it being weakned, yet doth it not from hence flow neceſſarily, that when he did believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he did believe it upon an Infallible authority; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, although he could not believe the Goſpel without it, yet might he account it as towards belief, but a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not a cauſe of his Faith. And this you muſt have, or elſe you do not contradict. Whatſoever is neceſſary to an effect, is not the cauſe of it; although whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40740:114"/> is a cauſe thereof is neceſſary to it.</p>
            <p>Therefore that is not ſo, which again you ſay that the ground of his beleef in the Goſpel was their infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; as not only theſe, but alſo the next words ſhew manifeſtly. When will you by your proof put the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible propoſal of the Church out of queſtion? when ſhall we have any more then ſuppoſals of it?</p>
            <p>Let us ſee your next words. Wherefore if in the Goſpel there be nothing found that is evident to prove the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> then I will beleeve the Catholicks rather then you: but if you ſhall read me out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſomething that is evident to prove <hi>Manichaeus</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; then neither will I beleeve the Catholicks nor thee. Why ſo? I will not beleeve the Catholicks, becauſe they (whoſe Doctrine I thought infallible) have lyed to me concerning the <hi>Manichaeaus.</hi> But I will not beleeve thee, even when thou citeſt clear Scripture (for of this caſe he ſpeaketh) and why ſo? becauſe thou doſt cite me that Scripture to which Scripture I had now beleeved upon their authority who have lyed to me. So you.</p>
            <p>And what now from hence can you gather more then from the former paſſage of the ſame nature, unleſſe you did make good another Parenthetical ſuppoſition, whoſe Doctrine, I thought infallible? This is not in Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but comes from your own private Spirit. And therefore if you will not be ruled by our Spirit becauſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exception to the contrary: ſurely we have no cauſe to be overperſwaded by your judgement without any reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, May you not from hence take notice that what I ſaid of Saint <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſtin,</hi> that in the Teſtimony here, he might ſpeak as in ſome heat of Diſpute? For can we think that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> had ſuch a ſoul as to ſay ſoberly and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically that he would not beleeve clear Scripture which was cited by any one, becauſe Catholicks had told him otherwiſe? Did Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> in your conceit differ in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40740:115"/> from your <hi>Aquinas?</hi> or did your <hi>Aquinas</hi> differ from Saint <hi>Auſtin?</hi> Conſider then what your <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith in his Summes, the firſt Part, the firſt queſtion, and the eight Art. <hi>Innititur enim fides noſtra revelationi Apoſtolis &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetis facta qui Canonicos libros ſcripſerunt;</hi> for our Faith doth rely upon the revelation made to the Apoſtles and Prophets who wrote the Canonical Books, but not upon the revelation, if any other was made to other Doctours: Nay, he confirms it by Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> out of his 19. Epiſt. a little after the beginning, <hi>Solis enim Scripturarum libris,</hi> &amp;c. For I have learned to give this honour onely to the Books of Scripture, which are called Canonical, as to believe moſt firmly, that none of the Authours thereof did erre in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing: but others I ſo read, that whatſoever holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or learning they are excellent in, I do not think true therefore becauſe they thought ſo or wrot ſo. Compare then this paſſage with the other, or the other with this; and then judge whether either he did not differ from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Principles, or did not ſpeak the former as a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let me note, whereas you do rightly tranſlate Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as ſpeaking of his beleef by the Catholicks in the tenſe more then paſt; you give your ſelf occaſion to think that he meant the main paſſage <hi>(non crederem)</hi> not of himſelf then, but as before a Manichee. And your argument which you produce a little after againſt this laſt anſwer, becauſe he ſpeaks here of beleeuing the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and beleeving it by a neceſſary conſequence (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath already beleeved the other Canonical books upon the ſame authority of the Church) doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw my anſwer; becauſe you ſay your ſelf that this book of the <hi>Acts</hi> he did beleeve by conſequence: by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church he was at firſt moved to beleeve the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther books; and therefore by conſequence he did beleeve the book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> becauſe the Catholick authority did in like manner commend both Scriptures. The ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40740:115"/> here in the preſent doth not derogate from my anſwer, becauſe the beleeving by conſequence, ſuppoſeth an act of beleeving antecedent.</p>
            <p>Alſo Fourthly, note that here he ſaid the Catholick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doth commend, both which may be done without infallibility. For the commendation doth not ingage the judgement in aſſent neceſſary: but the authority may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the mind to have a good opinion thereof, and ſo may move diſpoſitively to Faith.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Perpende it well, that it is ſaid by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that he was moved by the Catholick Church its authority, and that the Catholick authority doth commend both; not the <hi>Roman</hi> authority which now is included or to be included. And therefore if you could prove that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much as you would have, and alſo that his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were ſufficient to carry the cauſe for the Catholick <hi>Church;</hi> Yet you can have from hence no more then your part comes to of a particular Catholick Church; if indeed you were ſuch. And therefore have you upon your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſuch a labour as all diſcerning Catholicks would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or retract, namely to make good that whatſoever is ſaid of the Catholick Church, in the reſpects of it, ſhould be ſingularly appropriated to the <hi>Roman.</hi> But of this in your 27 number.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſeem to vaunt upon your paraphraſe, could he more clearly ſay, that if once in one ſingle lye he ſhould find the Churches authority to be fallible, he ſhould then have left unto him no infallible ground at all upon which he were to beleeve Scripture. So you. Firſt I deny your conſequence; this doth not follow from what you have urged that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> drives this diſcourſe that if he ſhould find them in a lye he could have no infallible ground to beleeve Scripture. It follows well that he could not beleeve Scripture by their authority, becauſe they had led unto him. But though they did not lie to him they might be fallible; for they might purpoſe that which they thought
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40740:116"/> to be true for errour: and therefore for their not lying can we not infer their infallibility. And for ought I ſee he doth not here any way give us to underſtand that he did think they could not lye to him; and therefore he could not conceive them upon this impoſſibility to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>As for that which you think an Argument againſt me, that he could not ſpeak any thing in heat or by ſlip which he ſo much inculcates. This is nothing effectual, for how often do we with fervour endevor to maintain that which once hath by incogitance or paſſion gone from us. Yea, it may ſeem more likely becauſe he doth ſo much incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it; becauſe we are ſo eager to cover our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and eſpecially when we are like to make good uſe of it againſt an adverſary. Secondly, what doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate that which you would have? But this is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as they ſay, this is under queſtion, and therefore his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcation is nothing to you, if he ſpeak it aſſertively, until you fortifie your ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>But one Marginal note of yours more at the ſign of the croſſe I find, and that is this. Had he ſaid, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved this or any other Scripture for the Light he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the reading of it, by which he diſcovered it to be Canonical, then the <hi>Manichaeans</hi> might as eaſily have ſaid, that by the like Light we clearly diſcover the Goſpel of <hi>Manichaeus</hi> to be Canonical. So you.</p>
            <p>This is no way moving, much leſſe cogent. For firſt, it proceeds from a Negative; which in the kind of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from Scripture (which is the adaequate rule) is of no validity. Becauſe he did not ſay ſo, therefore he did not hold ſo? No connexion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the ſame reaſon I may ſay, he did not hold the authority of the Church to be infallible, for then he would have told them ſo plainly, he would have made an end of the diſpute, without any need of uſing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:40740:116"/>
            <p>Thirdly, they were not prepared for this Theological Argument, becauſe they did not own the Church.</p>
            <p>And now all things being duely conſidered, I think you have no cauſe to ſay that I have not ſincerely and fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered what you have had to ſay for your ſelf out of that ſupreme Teſtimonie of Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare that chapter with the chapter you mention in the ſame Number below, namely the fifth, againſt the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the <hi>Manichee,</hi> with the 14. <hi>De util. Cred.</hi> againſt the <hi>Manichees</hi> too; you will not or cannot heartily diſlike my Anſwers, and therefore need I not diſtinctly to anſwer this laſt: ſince here alſo he doth not compare the authoritie of the Church with the authoritie of the Scripture, which is our main queſtion; but he compares with the authoritie of thoſe few, thoſe turbulent, thoſe new men, as he ſpeaks, (who were not like to bring forth any thing, which any without doubt might not think not worthy of authoritie) the authoritie of the Church, as to the beleeving of Chriſt; where alſo he ſaid that he was moved by the authoritie of the Catholicks; — <hi>Quorum autoritate commotus Chriſtum aliquid utile praecepiſſe jam credidi.</hi> Whereby you ſhall if you will, ſee the reaſonableneſſe of the former criticiſm; becauſe here he ſaid, <hi>jam credidi;</hi> ſo that it muſt refer to to him as a <hi>Manichee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore can you not with Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> beleeve the whole Scripture to be the Word of God from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the ending, as upon infallible authority of the Church; becauſe if he did, yet cannot you do it which is not to be done: and if it be to be done, becauſe he did it, then it is not to be done, becauſe he did it not. And I hope thoſe ſtrange ſtories, and thoſe ſeveral points (which you ſpeak to be in Scripture) may be more like to be beleeved upon the authority of the Scripture, then upon the authority of the Church; ſince the Church hath no authority but from Scripture, not as a Church. And therefore if you have no other infallible ground
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40740:117"/> for prayers to Saints, and prayer for the dead (in your ſenſe) and other like points, then you have proved he went upon, as towards the believing of Scripture, you have none. Nay, you have not ſo good authority for thoſe and ſuch like points, as he had for the belief of the Scripture: for beſides the difference of the matter, he had Catholick authority for his belief, though the authority was not Infallible: but you have not Catholick authority for your points, though fallible. But I obſerve your wiſdome. You would juſtifie your points here by Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which you think may be more likely, then to juſtifie your Infallibility by your points of difference.</p>
            <p>Therefore your conditional poſtulate might have been ſpared, untill the condition be proved. If Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> had done ſo as you ſuppoſe, then you or your Church would have been more excuſed from ſingularity, becauſe you had followed him. As for you, you need not fear ſingularity. You provide againſt that in your opinion, or your Maſters for you; for you muſt follow the Church, without examination of what they ſay. Their word muſt be taken: but yet your Church may be accuſed of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, becauſe it doth not follow the Catholique. If then you will do prudently (as you ſpeak) go with Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> no further, then he would have you follow him, namely in the way of Scripture, which he underſtood well, and at the latter time of his life: but whether he underſtood it as much as any the Church had (which you ſay) may be yet under debate (with all reſpect to Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>) ſince it appears not that he had any skill in Hebrew, and (if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well) confeſſeth that he learned Greek but late. So then, if in ſome caſes, your own Men confeſſe that we muſt have recourſe to the Original Languages, how could he underſtand them ſo well?</p>
            <p>And now come we to your grand aſſumption, that what hath been ſaid of the Catholick Church (that it is by Chriſt appointed to be the Judge of all Controverſies,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40740:117"/> and that the definition of this Judge is Infallible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a ſufficient ground of Faith) all the Doctrine muſt be applyed to the Roman Church, and cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Proteſtant Church.</p>
            <p>And now then you are pleaſed at the latter end to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your ſelfe, that you did intend at firſt the Roman Church, but dealt more cunningly then the reſt of the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> who do include in the nature of the one and true Church, ſubjection to the Biſhop of Rome. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this plot of yours might be ſomewhat reſembled by him who had that Phantaſie, that whatſoever Ship came to Port was his, ſo now every Church muſt be yours or none; as if the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea were the Ocean: or, you would have all the Honours that might be conferred by God upon that Church, he would pleaſe to own ſignally, and to make his; conceiving that this Church can be none but your own. And thus would you have led me on with ſome ingenuity, to be liberal in my reſpects and devoirs to the Catholick Church, that ſo you might without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſweep all for the Roman Catholick.</p>
            <p>But prove that thoſe priviledges, you ſpeak of, belong to the Roman Church, and cannot be applyed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church. You prove it thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, This Proteſtant Church doth not ſo much as lay claim to thoſe priviledges, and ſo by her own Doctrine, ſhe cannot be Judge or Infallible, nor any other Church but the Roman, upon the ſame reaſon, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves by evident and Infallible Scriptures their own Fallibility, as you prove the conſequence to be to the end of your Page of the 27. Number; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roman Church is the true Church, unleſſe Chriſt hath no true Chrch, nor hath had theſe many ages. This is your argument, which proceeds by way of a negative induction, not the Proteſtant Church, nor this other Church, nor that, nor any other Church doth claim the priviledge of being Infallible Judge, onely the Roman; therefore, otherwiſe Chriſt hath had no true Church theſe many Ages.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:40740:118"/>
            <p>Sir, Which will you give us leave to do, to ſmile or weep, that men not to be contemned for their Learning and Reading ſhould be abuſed, and ſhould endevour to abuſe others by ſuch ratioſinations, which are made uſeful onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>We and all other Churches do of their own accord yeild unto you that they are Fallible. We ſave you the labour of the eviction. True Churches they ſay they are, and ſay they are not Infallible; and they ſay alſo that you only do lay claim to this Infallibility: but what then? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have Infallibility? what, becauſe you only claim it? Suppoſe that the Roman Church doth lay claim to <hi>Utopia,</hi> or to the <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> no other Church doth, not the Proteſtant, not any other, therefore it is due to them. Yes, but where is this <hi>Utopia?</hi> where is this <hi>Terra incognita?</hi> what be the Priviledges and Dominions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are yet to ſeek for them, who lay claim to them. Firſt, then make it out that there is ſuch an Infallibility to be had before you challenge it, and do not prove the beeing of it by your challenging it, leſt your Roman Eagle be ſaid to catch at flies: but prove ſolidly the beeing of it by the grounds thereof: and then ſecondly, prove a juſt claim; for ſuppoſe that others did not lay claim to it, what right can yet you have by a claim? Is this alſo given <hi>primo occupanti?</hi> If you have no other tenure for your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, you have none, and it doth beſpeak fallibility to ſay the title is good.</p>
            <p>If I might be ſo bold (and ſurely I may in the cauſe of the truth of God) it is more likely to fall out thus; no Church but the Roman doth pretend to Infalliblity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it highly preſumptuous, and is onely in this not an Uſurper, becauſe there is no ſuch thing as belonging to any Church. We have no ſuch tradition, nor the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God: and yet alſo is it an inſolent Uſurpation of that Prerogative, which belongs onely to God and Scripture.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:40740:118"/>
            <p>This is enough to undo your argumentation and you: but whereas you ſay that all other Churches of other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions do ſay indeed that they themſelves are the onely true Churches; it is not true, they doe not ſpeak of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves excluſively, as you do. Particular true Churches, they may be under the truly Catholick Church, and therefore they can conteſſerate one with another, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective acknowledgements; but you are they who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all from the condition of being true Churches, which will not reconcile themſelves to you by abſolute ſubjection.</p>
            <p>And ſince you ſay that all other Churches but yours diſclaim Infallibility, you ſee that we alone do not ſtand aloof from obedience to your Roman Tyranny. So you are not Catholicks in dominion neither.</p>
            <p>Yet you would ſeem to have ſome reaſon for your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that one Church muſt be Infallible, otherwiſe Chriſt hath not, nor hath had, any true Church theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages. This is inconſequential, unleſſe there be ſome Church Infallible, Chriſt hath no true Church. It is a falſe propoſition, as we have anſwered you, from the firſt to the laſt, that a true Church is Infallible, and it is now all the queſtion. Though it be not true in every point, yet may it be a true Church. Every error doth not deſtroy the beeing of the Church, and you have very great cauſe not to preſſe this, leſt it be retorted againſt your Church, as it might be to be Even with you; that Church which holds it ſelfe Infallible, and yet hath erred, is Fallible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by your Doctrine no true Church; the Church of Rome holdeth it ſelf Infallible, and yet hath erred, then this is no true Church. And might not the aſſumption here be proved by your own Doctrine? for if the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church be the Rule of Faith, then you have erred in rejecting the Millenary opinion, which was a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church.</p>
            <p>So then your deſigne you ſpeak of in the 28. Number,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40740:119"/> of not expreſſing the Roman Church in your diſpute, you ſee is deſtroyed: for what you ſay of the Catholick Church, is not ſufficiently pleaded for the Roman, and alſo Infallibility is not yet aſſerted to the Catholick. And therefore your demonſtration you talk of, is but a flouriſh, and your Argument you think unanſwerable, is not to be anſwered, any more, becauſe that ſtrength which it had is taken away. And I have no more to ſay untill you have any more to ſay, upon this point or any you mean, in difference betwixt us.</p>
            <p>But yet you have not done, but like a <hi>Parthian</hi> who fights flying; ſo you diſpute ſtill ending. You ſay you will ſhew how unanimouſly the Fathers acknowledge this, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ep. 3. l. 1. ſaith, <hi>That falſe Faith cannot have acceſs to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> And when you pleaſe to preſs this, I ſhall ſhew you what little ground you are like to get in that Epiſtle; ſince though he names the <hi>Roman</hi> Church as the principal Church, as the chair of <hi>Peter,</hi> yet he there defends his own juriſdiction againſt thoſe who would ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Rome</hi> to have their cauſe heard and judged there. Neither will you get any credit by thoſe whom he ſpeaks of, and in thoſe words you quote, there is an intimation, that the <hi>Romans</hi> then, when he did write, were not ſuch as thoſe were in the Apoſtles times, <hi>Apoſtolo praedicante;</hi> and I ſhall tell you why it was called the principal Church, for a principle of Unitie; ſo he, from whence the Sacerdotal Unitie began; and alſo by reflexion from the Imperial Seat.</p>
            <p>And if you will object Saint <hi>Jerome's</hi> authoritie in his Comment upon the firſt to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he calleth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>the Rectour of the Houſe of God,</hi> which you ſay Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the Pillar and Foundation of Truth.</hi> I ſhall return you anſwer, that this is not very much; for other Biſhops were called in ancient times <hi>Papae</hi> too, and that he calleth him <hi>the Rectour of the Houſe of God,</hi> that is not much neither, ſince every Biſhop is ſo; The
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40740:119"/> Rectour of the Church in that place where he lives. And this will appear to be leſs conſiderable, if you will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that in his Comment upon the firſt Ep. to <hi>Tim.</hi> the third chapter upon theſe words, <hi>A Biſhop muſt be irreprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;</hi> where he ſpeaks of a Biſhop in <hi>communi,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>Aut Eccleſiae Princeps non erit;</hi> ſo a Biſhop in general with him is a Prince of the Church, and alſo you know what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had betwixt Biſhops and Presbyters, Read to this purpoſe his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius.</hi> If you come upon me again with Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> to <hi>Damaſus</hi> in an Epiſtle, you may tell me what Epiſtle, for he wrote more then one, and his Title in ſome is, as is ſet down plainly <hi>Hieronimus Damaſo.</hi> Surely Popes then had not that ſtate, or elſe Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> had little reverence towards him. And you may ſee alſo how the Pope writes to him to reſolve queſtions: And is this any ſign of the Popes Infallibilitie? Well, but you ſay in that Epiſtle you will tell me of, to <hi>Damaſus,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>To your Holyneſs,</hi> that is, <hi>To the Chair of</hi> Peter <hi>I am joyned in Communion: Upon this Rock I know the Church to be built, he that gathereth not with thee, ſcattereth.</hi> So you.</p>
            <p>And ſhall I give you anſwer to this now? then I may tell you that this doth but magnifie the honour of his own Commuion, and yet not much neither, if you will obſerve what he ſaith in his Comment upon <hi>Amos</hi> the 6. chapter, <hi>Petra Chriſtus eſt qui donavit Apoſtolis ſuis, ut ipſi quoque Petrae vocentur, Tu es</hi> Petrus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>Peter</hi> is not in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the onely <hi>Rock,</hi> you ſee. Moreover, ſo the Fathers you ſay, in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> at the voice of St. <hi>Leo</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaid, <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſpoken by the mouth of <hi>Leo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what can you ever make of this that they did ſay ſo? No more then thus much, that the Succeſſour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpoke. Doth this ſignifie that all the Perſonal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledges which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> had? then there needed but him to determin all the Controverſies. Yea, according to Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> before, if he had had all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40740:120"/> thoſe priviledges which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had, yet the Church ſhould not be built upon him onely; for the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were <hi>Rocks</hi> too. Yea, and is he Chriſts Succeſſour alſo? If he be not, then that which you would fain arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to him, belongs onely to Chriſt to be Head of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>To cut ſhort, you remit me to <hi>Statleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who both ſhew moſt diligently how all other Churches have gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive judgement in their chief cauſes. The places you ſay you will alledge, though for the preſent you refer me to them.</p>
            <p>What do you mean Sir, to put me off to thoſe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or in the interim to ſatisfie me until you have ranged them into another diſcourſe? I need not ſend you to our men who have withſtood thoſe Champions foot to foot —<hi>Junctuſque Viro Vir.</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes an exception againſt <hi>this ſupreme Tribunal for Appeals, and the African Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, you ſeem to threaten me with further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of particulars material to your cauſe. Untill which time it becomes me in civilitie to wait, and not to take the word out of your mouth, or your work out of your hand. I ſhall let you riſe that you may have more ſtrength for the next aſſault. I could leave here, but that our late Feaſt may hint you to think of the conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and other Churches about the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And were thoſe Hereticks or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that would not ſtand to the <hi>Roman</hi> determination herein?</p>
            <p>And as for your earneſt demand, to know but the name of one of the Paſtours Doctors, or Preachers in thoſe laſt thouſand Ages (Years) which preceeded <hi>Luther;</hi> I may conceive my ſelf obliged then to give you ſome account hereof, when you ſhall tell me whoever of all the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> in a vaſt inſolency took upon him the Empire of the whole Church, under the Title of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop,</hi> before
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40740:120"/> 
               <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third took it from <hi>Phocas</hi> his Donation. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s time incluſively there was no ſuch Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and you know what <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaid of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> for his pretending to it, that whoſoever did, made himſelf the forerunner of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if I would anſwer, the anſwer would be eaſie; and it is ready, you have it alreadie in a Teſtimonie out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his Preſcriptions, it may be you took no notice of it then, nor did I urge it to this purpoſe by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our Church, thus, <hi>That which we are, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were from the beginning, we are of them before it was otherwiſe, before they were corrupted by you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nay, how many of your <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion have given Teſtimonie to us in Subſtance of Doctrine, beſides <hi>

                  </gap>erus,</hi> whom you have abuſed (as I told you) therefore, to make him after death ſpeak falſe to Truth and himſelf. Nay, we are, what the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was, before the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was what it ſhould not be, and what it was not in the pureſt Primitiveneſs: and therefore your additional Doctrines (which, and your univerſal Juriſdiction pretended, have made the breach, and diſcontinued our Communion) we could not have from <hi>Rome</hi> then when it had them not. And therefore it is not proper for us to be Opponents; for we are upon the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. Doe you ſhew that a flouriſhing viſibilitie is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Church, and how it is like to be in your Church in the time of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> according to your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and how it held in the time of the <hi>Arrian</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Do you ſhew that you have had in your Communion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40740:121"/> all the Holy men and none other, and then you will do a miracle. And let us hear of it no more until it be done. As he ſaid, <hi>Landari non poteſt niſi peractum.</hi> Go on with your deſign, and let it be a real defence of your cauſe, by a ſolid and ſubſtantial maintenance of the points you hold, and we deny, but doe not offer to deceive us with old ſhooes and clouted, and mouldie bread, and old raggs and and old bottles, as if you came from a far Countrie, that you might be of a League together, as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> couz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> If you do, we ſhall endevour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.

            </p>
            <p>And now methinks I ſhould end; but for the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhewing (as you ſay) my Replie to your papers to be fully anſwered in your former diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, this is verie odd that you will not anſwer particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly my premiſſes, and yet I muſt combate with your concluſion. And yet if I have anſwered your premiſſes, in the Lawes of Diſputation, I have nothing to do with your concluſion. And therefore whatſoever part of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe you refer me to, in this your concluſion, for my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the firſt Replie, ſince it is punctually anſwered by me in the matter of it, needs not to be ſhewed by me to be inſufficient for my anſwer. For beſides that you leave me to find my own condemnation in your paper, where I can, which is a mightie labour and it may be impoſſible, (whereas you will urge a particular formal Judge to hear and determin,) beſides this; you may underſtand, that that which is not true in it ſelf (as I have ſhewed as well as you the contrarie) cannot anſwer me, for it cannot anſwer for it ſelf, being falſe: and therefore the product of it, were it rightly applied in the form, would be null.</p>
            <p>Yet have I a fancie, that ſince ſomewhat in it is not ſaid before by you, and ſomewhat you do charge me with; if I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40740:121"/> ſhould give no Replie thereunto, you would think that the cauſe were wanting, or I to it: I ſhall therefore where there is need briefly run it through.</p>
            <p>Firſt you ſay, that I ſaid there was little reaſon for me to rejoyn, becauſe in your paper you wave the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. You make your apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie that it was to no end, until I had granted that ſome Church was the ground of Faith. A man muſt firſt prove to a Jew, that the Meſſias is come, and then he muſt prove that Chriſt was this Meſſias. So you.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That I think I gave you the true Reaſon of your not including the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in your proſecution of the Catholick Church, before. But in that you ſay, that firſt a man muſt prove the Meſſias to be come before that he proves Chriſt to be the Meſſias, you ſpeak not congruouſlie, for Chriſt and Meſſias are all one, in different Languages; you mean that Jeſus is the Meſſias. For the Jewes acknowledged Jeſus, but not Chriſt. But let that paſſe. According to your Doctours you could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the Catholick Church from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as I have told you; ſince they include the Pope as Head, in the definition of the Catholick Church, and that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the nature of a thing you cannot abſtract from it; for then you ſhould make a falſitie in your abſtraction, for then you ſhould conceive the nature of it without that which is neceſſarie to the nature. And that which follows, as you ſay, by conſequent from the Catholick to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> is formerly denied.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you ſay that I ſay that I might ſtill have left you to anſwer your firſt paper with your ſecond. And ſo I ſay ſtill. You Replie that this is onely to ſtand to what I have ſaid, as you alſo do; Let the Reader judge with indifferencie. And I ſay, let the Reader or the world judge with indifferencie which of us doth moſt ſtand to his ſuppoſition without reaſon, or who is moſt likely to doe ſo; I, or you, who are ſo captivated to and by your infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40740:122"/> which you muſt ſtand out in by it ſelf, which is the Queſtion: and if you offer to prove it by Scripture, you come upon our ground.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, you ſay I ſay you doe not conclude contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorilie; and I ſay ſo ſtill. You Replie, that you alwaies conclude the Churches authoritie to be a ſufficient ground ground of Faith, and I ſay it is an inſufficient ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> But you do not conſider that your Arguments or Teſtimonies doe not conclude the Church a ſufficient ground: and therefore whether you as a Diſputant doe conclude contradictorilie, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>Nextlie, you come to my Eight anſwers, as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my laſt paper. And in my firſt anſwer, you ſay, I ſpent ſeven pages to prove the Scripture to be a ſufficient ground of Faith. So then I have made by your confeſſion my word good that I would give you a proof by Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that the Scripture is a ſufficient ground of Faith, which I have done with Reaſons alſo thereupon. But you tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, this this it is not to conclude contradictorilie. And why ſo? You ſay, that I ſhould have concluded that the Church cannot be a ſufficient ground of Faith; which may be and is true, though it alſo be moſt true that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a moſt ſufficient ground of Faith, when it is once known by an infallible authoritie to be the Word of God; and alſo when we evidentlie know that ſuch and ſuch is the undoubted ſenſe of Scripture. Thus you.</p>
            <p>But firſt, are there two ſufficient grounds of Faith or not, as to the ſame Objects? if one be ſufficient, why the other? if both be neceſſarie, then either is not ſufficient. So then, if the Scripture be the moſt ſufficient ground of Faith, when it be known to be the Word of God, and the ſenſe of it, then I have contradicted you, and you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted your ſelf.</p>
            <p>For I ſay as you ſay, that it is moſt true that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the moſt ſufficient ground of Faith. And two ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients there are not in the ſame kind. Yes, you ſay, but
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40740:122"/> firſt the Scripture muſt be known by infallible authoritie to be the Word of God. Well, but we both beleeve that the Scripture is the Word of God; and by infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie we do beleive the Scripture to be the Word of God, becauſe we do believe it by the authoritie of it ſelf, which you ſay is infallible. And if you believe it by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authoritie of the Church, as you think you muſt go to Scripture for this authoritie: then is not the Church a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground, becauſe it needs the Scripture to prove the Church, and confirm its authoritie. And therefore my concluding was contradictorie, ſince your ſuppoſition of two ſufficient grounds is falſe. Well, and how ſhall we know evidentlie whether this is the ſenſe of Scripture? By the authoritie of the Church, you ſay. And why then do they not by their authoritie evidentlie deliver unto us the ſenſe of Scripture in everie difficultie? If it cannot, it is inſufficient; if it will not, it is uncharitable; and beſides you fall into the ſame danger again. For where hath it this authoritie? by the Scripture; then the Scripture is the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground again, and this not. And when the Church in a Council doth decide a controverſie beſt, it doth ſo by principles of Scripture, applying them to particular caſes, and the determinations of the Church have themſelves to the Scripture, but as concluſions; and the Scripture hath it ſelf to thoſe concluſions, as the principle. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore properlie the principles are believed, and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are credible, not by themſelves, but by participation from the Principles. So that as the prime Principles are the ground of all Science, ſo are the Principles of Scripture the ground of all Faith. And the firſt Principle in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> muſt be this, that the Scripture is the Word of God, and ſo the ground of Faith. And if the Church be not ſubordinate; it is oppoſite to Scripture, as the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſo ſtands by it ſelf, and muſt fall to the ground. And if you ſay it is not neceſſarie to umpire all doubts, then you ſay as we ſay; and why then an infallible Judge?
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40740:123"/> And foraſmuch as we doe believe the Scripture to be the Word of God, why do you contend? becauſe we do not believe it as you believe it? but if you intend your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in charitie you might have ſpared your labour. For we are in a ſurer condition then you can be upon your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: You believe the Scripture by the authoritie of the Church, and we believe it by that by which the Church hath its authoritie. So that the Scripture is not onely the firſt ground in regard of Order, but alſo of Cauſalitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church hath no ground but by Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we like your intention better then your judgement. Neither do we denie the moment of the authoritie of the Catholick Church towards Faith, ſo that we have all the authoritie of Heaven and Earth for our belief. And if there were a doubt, and in us a poſſibilitie of errour by appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that we cannot be aſſured of the Scripture to be the Word of God by the Church; yet our errour would not be ſo dangerous, (becauſe we ſhould erre in honour of Scripture) as yours is or would be, who erre in honour of the Church.</p>
            <p>Alſo muſt I obſerve your ingenuitie again here that you do profeſs it as moſt true, that the Scripture is the moſt ſufficient ground of Faith, when we know by infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that it is the Word of God, and that ſuch and ſuch is the ſenſe thereof. If there be degrees of Truth and ſufficiencie then are we more ſecure: if degrees of Truth and ſufficiencie to us; then are we yet more right. And alſo this doth deduct from your univerſalitie of faith in your firſt paper by the propoſal of the Church in all things.</p>
            <p>For my ſecond, third and fourth, and fifth anſwer, the Paragraphs of your Diſcourſe or Treatiſe have in them nothing whith hath any potential contrarietie to them; which I have not fully, as I think taken away.</p>
            <p>In your Application you make to or againſt my ſixth anſwer, you ſeem to take another argument to perſwade me that the Scripture and the Church may both be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40740:123"/> grounds of Faith. It is by way of interrogation. Can I not, ſay you, ground my Faith upon what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, becauſe I can ground it upon that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith? We anſwer, your queſtion is out of queſtion, but your conſequence from thence is unſolid and unjudicious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were both inſpired in their Doctrine: but it is yet again in queſtion, whether the Church be infalliblie inſpired, and we can be infalliblie aſſured thereof, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being not the ſame; your reaſoning ſinks. Yet you inſiſt further. Why is the Scripture the rule of Faith? Becauſe it delivereth to me Gods written VVord, but the Church delivereth to me Gods VVord written and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written. I may therefore rule my ſelf by that. So you. I anſwer, This argument hath no ſtrength to weaken that which I laid down before, that there are not two ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grounds of Faith; becauſe the Church is but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial rule, and ſubordinate to Scripture, and ſo ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately a rule; as to that VVord of God which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: and therefore can it not ground or order my Faith by its own Vertue, but onely by proportion to Scripture: and ſo is not a rule equal to Scripture intenſively. And if you conceive your argument ſhould have any force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church doth exceed the Scripture extenſively, in that it delivereth the VVord written and unwritten; Surely you are much miſtaken by your ſuppoſition, that there is a VVord of God not written in points of Faith equally credible to that which is written. It is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not ſuppoſed. Your reaſoning rather hath force againſt your ſelf; The Church is not a rule infallible; becauſe it delivereth to us a VVord of God not written, for herein it mainly erres. The Scripture is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a neceſſarie rule, but alſo ſufficient, moſt ſufficient. And therefore they bring in tradition by way of ſupplement: you ſay it is a ſufficient rule in that you ſay it is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of Faith, therefore muſt you expunge tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:40740:124"/>
            <p>This rule of Scripture you ſay is often ſo crookedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that we had need of better ſecuritie of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then our own judgement of diſcretion. So you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, this is accidental to the rule, and therefore it doth not infringe its prerogative.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this Argument, if you drive it to the not being a rule upon this account, the traditions and the teſtimonies of the Fathers cannot be a rule, becauſe they have been abuſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We do not intend the uſe of the judgement of diſcretion to reſt in that upon an interpretation; nor do we oppoſe it to the authoritie of the Church: but we ſay this muſt be ſatisfied in Articles and matters of Faith (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the deciſions of the Church) by conſonance thereof to Scripture, otherwiſe it cannot give the aſſent of Divine Faith. Every one muſt be perſwaded in his own mind, although he doth not make his own ſenſe. This private judgement ſhould neither be blind nor heady, it reſpects authoritie; but joyneth only with appearance of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>That which you ſay to the ſeventh anſwer was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before. That which you ſay to the eighth anſwer will not ſerve to ſave you from differing from your ſelf, which indeed if it were in way of retractation, would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible; as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks in the Preface of his Retractations, <hi>Neque enim niſi imprudens,</hi> &amp;c. for neither will any but an unwiſe man reprehend me, becauſe I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend my errours.</p>
            <p>But if you have a mind to ſee the difference betwixt you and you, you may, thus. Before, you ſaid that the ground of believing is the authoritie of the Church; ſince you have ſaid, in your ſecond paper that it is the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God revealing. If there be no difference, why do you not keep your terms, as a Diſputant ſhould do? But you ſay your reply is exceeding eaſie; the ground of our faith is God revealing, and God revealing by his Church,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40740:124"/> as he firſt cauſeth our firſt belief, when he tells us by his Church ſuch and ſuch books are infallibly his word. So you.</p>
            <p>Now then, if you make the authoritie of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be the ground and cauſe of faith, then it is not the authoritie of the Church, becauſe although God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal by his Church, yet is not the authoritie of the Church the ground of faith, but Gods authoritie; for the Church is but as a Meſſenger or Ambaſſadour, which we do not believe for himſelf, but for his Letters of Credence from his Maſter: and ſo is it the authoritie of Gods revealing, which is the ground of faith. And this is made out by that you ſay, to compound your variance: You ſay, the ground of our faith is God revealing, and Gods revealing by his Church, as he firſt cauſeth our firſt belief, when he tells us by his Church ſuch and ſuch books are infallibly his word: then the authoritie is his, whereby we believe, and not the authoritie of the Church, which is but Mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>terial. And by your own argument are you undone; for if the Church be the ground of faith and not the Scripture, becauſe by the Church we believe ſuch and ſuch books to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical (as you have ſaid before, and alſo here below in this Reply to my eight Anſwer) then alſo the Authoritie of the Church is not the ground of faith, becauſe we muſt firſt believe Gods authoritie revealing it to his Church, before we believe the Church. But alſo, to take notice of that Argument of yours here, it is falſe. For we muſt firſt believe the authoritie of Scripture, before we can believe any authoritie of the Church. For the Church as ſuch, hath all from Scripture, as I have ſhewed. And therefore by your own argument are you undone again: for if that be the ground of faith, which is firſt, then the Scripture, not the Church: and therefore the Church may be diſputed; not the Scripture, which we do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by way of Intelligence through a ſupernatural light;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40740:125"/> and cannot demonſtrate, as we may, the Church by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſeem to differ from your ſelf, becauſe now you hold that the Church is the ground of our faith in all particulars, cauſally, becauſe by it we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but before, the faith of a Catholick (which you mean generally) muſt conſiſt in ſubmitting his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and adhering to the Church, and in believing every thing, becauſe ſhe propoſeth it; ſo your firſt paper <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis terminantibus.</hi> But now when we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Church, we may believe that which is plain in it by it ſelf, becauſe it ſaith it, not becauſe the Church ſaith it. Do not you now ſomewhat yield, not to me, but to truth? Truth will be too hard for any one that hath not committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: and yet alſo will it be too hard for him, though he denies it. Conſider then what you have ſaid, and what you think; and judge how the Maſters of your Church will anſwer it at Gods Tribunal for that everlaſting cheating of ſimple ſouls with the myſterie of implicite faith.</p>
            <p>And that alſo which you ſo much repeat, that we muſt receive Canonical books by the Infallible authoritie of the Church, is not yet grown beyond the height of a poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. It hath been often denied you upon neceſſitie; and it did not obtain, it ſeems, univerſally in the practice of the Church, or elſe ſome of your <hi>Apocriphal</hi> books were not accounted Canonical; for <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his fourth <hi>Catecheſe,</hi> where he ſpeaks in part of the Scriptures, he accounts not in the number the <hi>Maccabees</hi> you ſpoke of, nor ſome others.</p>
            <p>Yea, for the reception of books Canonical, Saint <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> gives another reaſon of embracing but four Goſpels, (in his Preface upon the Comment upon Saint <hi>Matthew</hi>) not becauſe the Church owned no more, as you would have Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> to be underſtood: but he doth prove
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40740:125"/> that there are but four, by compare of that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> with that of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> about the foure beaſts, which doe repreſent, as he interprets their meaning, the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ſay, God revealing is alwayes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Object of faith. Before every thing was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as propoſed by the Church, becauſe ſhe propoſeth it: ſo that the formal Object of things to be believed, was as propoſed by the Church, under that conſideration. But ſometimes God revealeth his mind by Scripture, ſometimes by the Church, as he did two thouſand years and more before the Scriptures were written. So you. Well then, now he reveales himſelf by Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinctly to the Church, as well as by the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinctly to Scripture, which you put in one behalf of your unwritten word. So then, we may believe him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by Scripture: but whether we can believe him immediately by tradition without Scripture, wants convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Neither doe you exhibit a reaſon of this Opinion by that which follows, that for two thouſand years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before the Scriptures were written, he revealed himſelf by the Church. This as before is not enough to ſuſtain traditional Doctrine, becauſe the Scripture in the ſubſtance of it, was before it was written: but you cannot evince that the word not written is as certain to us, as the word before it was written was unto them. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be taken from Gods wiſe Diſpenſations to his Church, then when there was no Word written, he would provide, that that whereby the Church ſhould be ruled, ſhould be extraordinarily conveyed and preſerved: but now, when there is a Word written, which is a moſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of Faith, (as you confeſſe) there is no ſuch cauſe of any word beſide it. If the Scripture be a Rule of faith, as you do liberally grant, then this is now a rule
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40740:126"/> not onely incluſively, but excluſively: for otherwiſe it is not as large as that which is to be ruled; and then they will not agree in the nature of Relatives; and ſo it will not be a Rule of faith and manners. For indeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of a Rule doth not only exclude leſſe, but alſo more. It ſpeaks againſt adding to it as a Rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners neceſſarie in themſelves, as well as againſt the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of not ordering them by it. But then again, your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſoning is inconcludent; becauſe God revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Church ſeverally, before he revealed himſelf by his Church. And therefore this was not the way univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally holding, namely by the Church, even before the Scripture was written. And therefore much leſſe doth it now bind when the Word of God is written. Shew the like inſpirations to the Church, as the Prophets had, by ſome infallible way, and then we ſhall ſay, that thus ſaith the Lord abſolutely, undiſputedly, without poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of contradiction, by the mouth of the Church in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it pleaſeth to aſſert for the truth of God, to be believed equally to Scripture; and then a Council is to be believed without Scripture, as the <hi>Nicene,</hi> you mean, was not believed or to be believed without; for it did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by it, and by that Text I named, <hi>[I and my Father are one;]</hi> which Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> doth apply to that queſtion foure times in that Epiſtle you named. And if you can prove that Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſours (as you imagine) had that tranſient gift of immediate Revelation as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had, then ye might ſay, <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake by the mouth of <hi>Leo,</hi> as infallibly as God ſpake by his. Then the <hi>Arrians</hi> had as good a plea for their opinion, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had; for they urged the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and more Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> mentions in the ſame Epiſtle: if what is ſaid by the Church muſt be true, then <hi>Athanaſius</hi> muſt have changed his Opinion. Or if you will have alwayes the Pope to be put into the authoritie of the Church for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40740:126"/> definition binding the conſciences of all Chriſtians to believe it as Goſpel; then muſt we believe that what he defines is Infallibly true. What? becauſe he cannot erre? No more then thoſe fourtie Popes which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpeaks of in his fourth Book <hi>De Rom. Pontif.</hi> from, the 8. chapter, to the 15. who have been, as he ſaid accuſed of errour; and ſome whereof none can ſay that all the diſtinctions and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have been deviſed for this purpoſe, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly juſtifie.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Zephyrine,</hi> a Montaniſt, then he erred; if not a Montaniſt, then <hi>Tertullian</hi> is not to be believed. <hi>Liberius</hi> as before an <hi>Arrian;</hi> ſo <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſo <hi>Jerome,</hi> ſo <hi>Damaſus</hi> of him; and <hi>Damaſus</hi> could not erre as you hold, yet an <hi>Arrian</hi> is ſurely in errour? is he not? <hi>Honorius</hi> was erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous too; and he ſpoken of in a former paper, he a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelite,</hi> as <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> ſaith ſome Catholicks hold; and he proves it by Synods, the ſixth, the ſeventh, the eighth, and he proves it by Epiſtles of Popes; if all there be deceived, how ſhall we believe authoritie of man? As for <hi>Gregory</hi> the Third, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in the 12. chapter of that book doth openly ſay, <hi>Vel certe Pontificem ex ignorantia lapſum eſſe, quod poſſe Pontificibus accidere non negamus.</hi> So he. Then do you reconcile errour by ignorance with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. How is he like to be Infallible in all his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when he was ignorant in the Goſpel, and therefore gave a Diſpenſation to a man to take another wife, if the former had a diſeaſe that made her not able for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal debt? And <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro</hi> in his 1. book 4. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath this paſſage, <hi>Omnis enim Homo errare poteſt in fide etiam ſi Papa ſit. Nam de Liberio à Papa conſtat fuiſſe Arrianum. Et Anaſterium Papam fuviſſe Neſtorianis, qui Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias legerit non dubitat;</hi> and a little after, <hi>Nam cum conſtet plures eorum adeo illiteratos eſſe ut Grammaticam penitus ignorent, qui fit ut ſacras Literas interpretari poſſent.</hi> And how then ſhall we by your Head of the Church, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40740:127"/> ſeverally or together know the undoubted ſenſe of Scripture infallibly? But many neceſſary places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, do not, (as you imagin) need a Judge, or not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
            <p>All things alſo neceſſary to be believed, are ſet down in Scripture, and the contrary you have not ſhewed, and therefore is there no need of an infallible Judge for the former; or tradition for the latter, as I have ſhewed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, you proceed thus; The Revelation of God coming to us in all theſe caſes by the Church, you by your own words in this place muſt grant her authoritie to be our ordinary cauſe of Faith. So you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> As you ſuppoſe much for your advantage, without colour of reaſon; ſo you confound much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction. Firſt, the term <hi>Revelation</hi> hath two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, one to the Agent, and ſo it refers to the act and manner thereof; another to the matter of that which is revealed, that is the object. The Revelation of God taking it paſſively, for the object, the matter which is revealed, comes to us by the Church, becauſe the Word written ordinarily comes to us by the Church: But taking Revelation of God actively, with reſpect to the manner, to bear your ſenſe, that God doth reveal himſelf infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the Church, either in the caſe of Canonical books or of doubts about the ſenſe of Scripture; ſo it doth not come by the Church; and therefore is it not the ordinary cauſe of Faith, which muſt rely upon infallible veritie, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks in his firſt part, firſt queſtion, eight anſwer, and therefore as before, doth rely upon the Revelation made to the Apoſtles and Prophets, which wrote the Canonical books; and not then upon the Church, who was bound to receive theſe Books, and to communicate them. So that the Church is concluded to be as an inſtrument only, or a motive of this faith; an inſtrument by its office, and a motive by its authority.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40740:127"/> And as for declaring undoubtedly the ſenſe of Scripture; So is there not any neceſſity of a Judge infallible, which you would have the Church to be. Secondly, you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that which is not to be ſuppoſed, that by my words, ſince in thoſe caſes the revelation of God comes to us by the Church, I muſt grant her authority to be the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe of faith: and you ſay alſo that by my words in this place I muſt grant ſo. Surely you here do commit <hi>Crimen falſi,</hi> for I do not ſee upon the place any half Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables out of which you may draw any ſuch interpretative Confeſſion. I have often upon your occaſion, ſaid the contrary, that the authority of the Church cannot be the cauſe of faith. And therefore whether you have any faith of the Articles of Religion, or of Scripture, in all your Church, is more eaſie to be found then ſaid. And aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly though we talk of faith in the world, the greateſt part of it is but opinion, which takes religion upon the credit of man and not of Scripture. And as for us; we have alſo the authority of the Church Catholick to move our judgement; and Scripture to ſettle our faith. And we are more related to the foure General Councils in conſanguinitie of Doctrine, as he ſaid, then your Church now.</p>
            <p>And now at the end of all, you doe fairly rebate the edge of your cenſure of my Expreſſion, namely, Exceſſe of Faith.</p>
            <p>But you ſay, my diſtinction doth no way ſalve the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprietie of my Speech. For there is ſtill a difference in more believing Objects, and believing more Objects. But granting that it may be improperly ſpoken, yet even in that ſenſe it is not truely ſaid, becauſe there can be no Exceſſe of Faith, in believing that which God hath ſaid.</p>
            <p>So then by my Diſtinctions which is your School of <hi>Fides Subjectiva, &amp; fides Objectiva; fides Qua, &amp; fides Quae;</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:40740:128"/> there may be an Exceſſe of Faith, in the Object, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive more then God hath ſaid; ſuppoſing we can believe what God hath not ſaid; although there be not an exceſs of faith in the Subject; for we cannot have too much faith in that which is to be believed. But the quarrel againſt the ſpeech was not becacauſe it was not proper enough and congruous in this Diſcourſe, but becauſe of the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to you; as it now appears; and therefore here would you vindicate the Church in this upon the ſame ground of infallibilitie; <hi>and therefore for your Faith in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you believe, you have this Warrant, Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> But ſince, this infallibilitie of yours you cannot have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out begging of the queſtion even to the laſt, nor ſhall have it ſurely by begging, you are yet to finde out ſome Expedience of Means or Arguments how to preſerve your ſelves from that juſt charge of Exceſſe of Faith: and the chief of that kind is that you ſpeak of your infallibilitie; for which you have not, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> How then do you prove it? by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And how do you prove Tradition, by the infallibility of the Church? Therefore go not to Faith about by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. If you have a deſire to reſt your judgement, and your ſoul in certain infallibilitie, by your own word; then center in Scripture, from which all Lines of Truth are drawn, and diſmiſſe Tradition (as your men ſtate it) for which this infallibilitie was deviſed; and yet cannot be maintained; for it cannot maintain it ſelf.</p>
            <p>You cloſe with a paſſage of Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> If ſo the words, you intend it to ſet out your Charity to the Church of Chriſt, not to perſwade my Faith in its infallibilitie. I may love the Church without infallibility, becauſe though I doe not love Errour, yet muſt I love the Church when it is in Errour.

               <hi>To the Reader.</hi> How in theſe times in which there be ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, the true Religion may certainly be found out.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Satisfactory Anſwer to this Title will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone put an end to the endleſs controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of theſe dayes. This made me think my labour well beſtowed in treating this point ſomewhat largely. And becauſe that Treatiſe hath received a very large anſwer, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining of this anſwer will make the Truth yet more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. That this may be done more clearly, I will briefly tell you the Order I intend to obſerve in the examination of the ſaid anſwer. And becauſe this anſwer directly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the ſame Order which I obſerved in treating the queſtion prefixed in my Title; Therefore when I have ſhewed you the Order of that Treatiſe, you will clearly ſee that I ſhall moſt orderly anſwer the Reply againſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Treatiſe had a ſhort Preface to tell the intent of it. My firſt Chapter muſt then be the Examination of what is ſaid againſt this Preface. Again, that Treatiſe did ſhew five things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it did ſhew the neceſſity of a Judge, to whom all are bound to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Scripture alone did not ſuffice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40740:130"/> all neceſſary Controverſies without a living Judge (to the 17. Numb.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that this Judge could be no other then the true Church (to the 21. Numb)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the true Church is infallible in her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points of Faith, (to the 17. Numb.)</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That this true Church which is our infallible Judge, is the Roman Church, (to 29 and laſt Numb.)</p>
            <p>Laſtly, followed the Concluſion. My anſwer therefore muſt have five more chapters to ſhew the Reply made againſt that Treatiſe to be unſatisfactory in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular argument oppoſed againſt me in all theſe five points.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There might have been added another chapter to examine what my adverſary ſaith concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my Treatiſe. But as he himſelf (Page 112.) obſerveth very well, he might have ſpared his Reply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Concluſion, becauſe it containeth no new thing appertaining to the main Controverſie, but it was made onely to ſhew that in the handling of the main Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, I had anſwered all his paper, which I did there run over in order. And therefore in his anſwers to all I had ſaid about the main Controverſie, he had given up his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all that which is onely run over again in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Neither know I any reaſon that I gave him to fanſie (as he ſaith he doth) that I ſhould either think a good cauſe wanting to him, or him wanting to a good cauſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had anſwered my Concluſion apart, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were in it not ſaid before by me and ſome few things in which I charge him. But Sir, that which I ſtand upon is the main queſtion and the proof or diſproof of it. Nor will I judge ſo hardly of you as to think you will conceive either my cauſe worſe, or me a worſe defender of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I tire not my ſelf and my Reader with our perſonal debates, when they concern not the main queſtion, in which both of us have been ſo large. And ſo as you thought you might have ended when you came to that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40740:130"/> concluſion, ſo I think I may well end when I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thoſe hundred Pages, and more, which I met with before I come thither, though there ſtill remained ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which concerned our private debates. For if that which hath been ſaid before doth not ſatisfie, no great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction will be added by going on a little further in the ſame ſtrain in matters leſſe to the matter.</p>

            <p n="1">1. YOur firſt words intimate that you fear leaſt your ſilence ſhould make me ſeem to my ſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to have got the Victory. Sir, your Reply is moſt welcome in this reſpect that it doth more help me then your ſilence could, not to ſeem to have got, but really to get that Victory which I deſire not to my ſelfe, but to truth. For the examination of your Reply will ſerve for a Touch-ſtone to my Arguments. I will follow you as you deſire ſtep after ſtep, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew the neceſſity of treating the matter I had undertaken, I ſaid that ſuch a manner of reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as is permitted by you to all ſorts of people, with ſo unlimited a Licence, to interpret them according to their own private judgement of diſcretion, as a thing moſt apt to cauſe a numberleſſe number of Sects and Hereſies. A <hi>priori</hi> this is proved thus. You permit any Artificer, who can read, to take the Bible into his hand, and to take it for his ſole, and onely Iudge of all neceſſary Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. And though all the force and efficacy of the words of Scripture conſiſt in the true ſence and ſincere Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40740:131"/> of it, yet when all comes to all you leave this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to be made by every Reader, though never ſo unskilful with ſo great Latitude, that though a General Council of the greateſt Doctors which could be gathered together, ſhould have defined ſuch and ſuch a point for undoubted true Doctrine, and to be held ſo according to Scripture, yet you permit any Cobler to make a Review of this Decree, and if he hearing all that can be ſaid on the one ſide and on the other, judgeth at laſt that the whole Councel hath erred in interpreting Scripture, you leave him free to hold himſelf ſo ſtrongly to his own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, as if it were the true ſence of Gods Word; neither will you hear of any Obligation which he hath interiorly to ſubmit his judgement (which is the ſeat of true faith or errour) to any other Iudge upon earth. For ſurely if he be left by your Principles ſo free in the choice of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, as not to be obliged to ſubmit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly to a whole General Council, he hath far greater freedom in not being obliged to ſubmit to any other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctours. Is not this to leave men in a mighty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of misunderſtanding Gods Word, and falling into Hereſie?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſame is proved a <hi>poſteriori</hi> in thoſe places where the ſacred Scriptures are thus proſtituted not only to the bare reading, but alſo to the interpretation of every profane and ignorant fellow (I ſtill mean when he ſhall have heard or ſeen what can be alledged on all ſides) there and onely there, Sects have multiplied, and do multiply beyond meaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither do any of your arguments prove this not to be the true cauſe of Hereſies, and bad life which followeth Hereſie. Firſt it is ſo far from being contrary to that Text, <hi>You erre not, knowing the Scripture,</hi> that it is moſt agreeable to it. For a moſt fit way to erre againſt the knowledge of Scripture, is to permit ſuch, and a great number of ſuch men to interpret Scriptures, as are moſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40740:131"/> fit to erre in the interpretation of them eſpecially being licenſed to croſs all Antiquity, and all the Authority of the Church if theſe ſtand in their way. And I wonder why you call this your manner of proceeding, <hi>The knowledge of Scripture.</hi> If the works of theſe famous Phyſitions <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hipocrates,</hi> were thruſt into all Trades-mens hands, and every one of them were licenſed to interpret, as they ſincerely thought beſt, would you call this <hi>The knowledge of Phyſick,</hi> eſpecially if every one might be permitted to hold his interpretation againſt a General Aſſembly of moſt learned Phyſitians? Secondly, you in vain object that of Saint <hi>Paul, That the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi> Far was it from the intention of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſpeak of the Scriptures interpreted by every gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fanſie; for thus they may be the occaſion of our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid they were able to make <hi>Timothie wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> becauſe he was a man <hi>who did continue in the things which he learned and had been aſſured of</hi> (to wit, by the Oral tradition of the Doctours of the Church) <hi>A man knowing of whom he had learned theſe things,</hi> and theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Let ſuch men read Scriptures, and let them with ſuch interpretations underſtand them, and they will make <hi>them wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>to continue ſtill aſſured of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, and never to contradict that.</hi> Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>I confeſſe that when we are by the Church aſſured that the Scripture is the Word of God we may ground our faith in it for thoſe things which are plainly delivered:</hi> Yes, but I alſo ſay, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are not plainly delivered in Scripture. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That many to their perdition did misunderſtand ſome hard places of Saint</hi> Paul. So that misinterpretation of hard places may be the cauſe of <hi>perdition.</hi> Fourthly you object Hereſie and lewd life to ſome in whom you ſay we inveſted infallibity. If I ſhould grant all, what prove you from hence, but that there be other wayes to Hereſie, and bad life, beſides giving all ſcope to interpret the Scriptures as we judge fit;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40740:132"/> So there be other wayes to Hell beſides Drunkenneſſe, but what doth this hinder drunkenneſſe from being the high way to Hell. Again, had not <hi>David,</hi> who was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer and adulterer; had not <hi>Salomon,</hi> who was an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, the infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in writing ſeveral parts of the Holy Scripture? But to prevent this, and all that elſe where you doe, or can ſay againſt the Pope, I (in my 21. Number) deſired you, and all to take notice of that which here you quite forget. I ſaid, <hi>I would have every one to know that the Roman Church doth oblige to no more, then to believe that the Pope defining with a lawfull Council cannot erre,</hi> How then doth the belief or faith of our Church (I ſpeak not of private mens private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) inveſt infallibility in a perſon heretical or lewd? Thoſe Doctors who are of that opinion that the Pope can not erre in defining out of a general Council, have other Anſwers to your Objection. But that which you ſay is nothing againſt our faith, which no man (though never ſo little a <hi>Frenchman</hi>) will ſay obligeth us to hold the Pope infallible in defining, out of a general Council. So much for this.</p>
            <p>Whereas I ſaid that we cannot have, as things ſtand, any other aſſurance to ground our faith upon then the Church, you tell me, I ſuppoſe the queſtion. Sir, I did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but onely propoſe, what preſently I meant to prove. And where as you ſay, that I do not well conſider what I ſay, when I ſay, <hi>that as things ſtand we have no other aſſurance.</hi> I anſwer, That though God might have ordained otherwiſe, yet as things ſtand the Church is the ground of our faith in all points, ſpeaking of the laſt ground on which we muſt ſtand, not a Humane, but a Divine ground, <hi>The pillar and ground of Truth;</hi> and it is the <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe by it we believe the Scripture to be the Word of God as I ſhall ſhew, Numb. 20. chapter, 3. Neither doe we firſt believe the Church for the Scripture as I ſhall ſhew, chapter 3. Numb. 31.32. though againſt thoſe who have firſt admitted
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40740:132"/> the Scriptures for Gods Word, we do prove by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures the authority of the Church. That I have ſaid nothing againſt the practice of our Church, appeareth by what I ſaid juſt now, ſhewing how the people deprave the hard places of Scripture to their own perdition.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You charge me with abating from my firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in which I ſaid, Divine Faith in all things was cauſed by the propoſal of the Church, becauſe now I ſay that when by the infallible authoritie of the Church we are aſſured that the Scripture is the Word of God, we may believe ſuch things as are clearly contained in Scripture. Good Sir, Do you not ſee, that if I be asked why I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (in this caſe) ſuch a thing, my firſt anſwer will be becauſe God hath ſaid it in the Scripture? but if I be preſſed further; and why do you believe the Scripture to be Gods undoubted Word? my laſt anſwer muſt be for the infallible authoritie of the Church by which God teacheth this Verity. Surely the main queſtion that ſerveth for the knowledge of the ground work of all our faith, is to examin upon what authoritie at laſt all our faith doth rely, when all comes to all. Take then the belief of what particular points you pleaſe, and examine upon what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority it cometh at laſt to rely, and you ſhall ever find it to be the authoritie of God revealing by the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now whether my adverſary be indeed, as he ſaith, one of the moſt ſlender Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or whether he hath ſhewed that Treatiſe of mine to be no Demonſtration; Let the indifferent Reader, after due pondering the force of all Arguments determin. Sure I am that this is no Demonſtration which you adde; <hi>The Scripture is infallible, but the Church is not, therefore I muſt take for the ground of my Faith the Scripture.</hi> For firſt, The Scripture cannot be proved to be Gods Word without the Church be infallible, as I ſhall ſhew, chap. 3. Numb. 20. Hence followeth ſecondly that the Church muſt have infallibilitie ſufficient to ſupport this moſt weightie
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40740:133"/> Article of our faith, <hi>That all the Scripture is the Word of God,</hi> and therefore though upon her authority I believe Scripture to be moſt infallible, yet becauſe I ground this belief on her authoritie, her authoritie is the laſt ground of Faith.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And whereas in your next Number, you promiſe ſuch ſouls as have forſaken an infallible Church, a happy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie upon this ground, that <hi>thoſe things which are neceſſary to ſalvation are plain in Scripture,</hi> I pray God their ſouls come not to be required at your hands. For this ground is moſt groundleſs in two reſpects. Firſt, becauſe no ſoul can have infallible aſſurance of the Scriptures being the true Word of God, if the Church be not infallible, and you refuſing to ſtand on this ground make the laſt ground of all your faith to be I know not what kind of Light, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to certain eyes, ſuch as yours are, diſcovering unto them infallibly, that ſuch and ſuch books be the infallible Word of God. The vanity of which Opinion I ſhall ſhew chap. 1. Numb. 20.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Secondly, It is moſt manifeſtly falſe, <hi>That all things neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are plainly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> as I ſhew chapter 3.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In your next Paragraph, I find nothing which I have not here anſwered, onely you ſtill force me to ſay, <hi>I would have every one to know that the Roman Church doth oblige to no more then to believe, that the Pope defining with a lawfull Council cannot erre.</hi> What proceeds from this authority we profeſs to proceed from the authoritie of the Church. VVhen the Church diffuſed admitteth theſe definitions her conſent is yet more apparent.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As for your complaint that your paper is not fully anſwered; I ſuppoſe that if any thing of importance was left unanſwered you will tell me of it here, that I may here anſwer it. Concerning my manner in anſwering of you, I muſt tell you that St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the chief School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, for clarity and brevity, uſe to proceed thus. Having firſt propoſed the queſtion they put down the reaſons
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40740:133"/> which ſeem to make againſt the truth. This was done to my hand in your firſt paper. Then they ſet down the Truth and the Reaſons of it, and this Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in his <hi>Quaeſtionibus faſiùs diſputatis</hi> doth ſometimes very largely; (and this I did to your hand in my laſt paper.) Laſtly, they ſolve the former Objections againſt truth, by reference to ſuch Reaſons as they (in their Proofs) did ſhew the truth to be grounded upon. And this in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion I ſhewed my ſelf to have performed; or, if any little thing were wanting I did ſupply it; Wherefore, though I had not your conſent to proceed thus with your paper, yet I content my ſelf with having the conſent of the beſt Schoolmen. My intention in rejoyning by a Treatiſe was to have this moſt important matter diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, orderly, and fully put down. And by having done ſo I find this great commoditie, that your anſwer becomes more Methodical, and my Reply to your Anſwer more clear and perſpicuous. And the Reader ſeeth ſtill how orderly the combat is.</p>

               <note place="margin">Of my ſecond Number.</note>2. God having made man to a ſupernatural end to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſupernatural means, (among which the firſt is true faith) it is clear that he muſt according to his merciful Providence, provide us ſome way to this faith, ſo eaſie, that all (if they pleaſed) might be brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. And becauſe the far greater part of men were ignorant, it beſeemed his goodneſſe (who is the Lover of Souls) to provide us ſuch a way as theſe ignorant men ſhould not be able (unleſs by wilfully careleſneſs) to erre by it, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 35. promiſing at the coming of the Meſſias, <hi>A Path and a way which ſhall be ſo direct to us that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> To elude this Text; You ſay, ſure may we be that the Letter doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> after their Redemption from Captivity. I anſwer, if this be ſure, then ſure it is, That God directeth the <hi>Jewiſh Church by a way ſo direct that fools could not erre by it.</hi> And if he did this to the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> there can be no good reaſon why he ſhould be leſs careful to direct the ignorant of the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi> Whence you ſee I had no reaſon to have feared this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Yet I think it is ſure that this is not the true interpretation, for when did <hi>the blind ſee, deaf hear,</hi> when did then <hi>God himſelf come and ſave us?</hi> And if you will have our Saviour himſelf to be this way, as he ſaid, <hi>I am the Truth and the Way,</hi> this ſelf ſame Saviour ſaid, I (who am this way) <hi>am with you untill the conſummation of the world,</hi> to wit, <hi>directing my Church the right way to ſalvation,</hi> of which direction the Church hath no leſſe need now, then then. And as we could not ſecurely have put a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40740:134"/> to theſe words of <hi>Joel,</hi> if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured us of the true ſenſe, ſo cannot you here limit theſe words, not having the like warrant for it. And as for the firſt part of Miracles, it is manifeſt by our Saviour his own words, <hi>Thoſe who believed in him ſhould do greater then he had done.</hi> If then this Text was Verified after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours time, you cannot ſay it is onely ſpoke of his time, and that he did take away <hi>a way</hi> ſo neceſſary for us, <hi>His guifts being without Repentance.</hi> And it is ſtrange that you thinking this guift Litterally conferred to the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> ſhould with the ſame breath plead ſo hard that it is a guift, <hi>which ſhould not in full dimenſion be alwayes extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church.</hi> I cannot believe that you truſt your other argument. <hi>If this way be promiſed to the Church,</hi> Ergo <hi>the Church is not this way.</hi> Suppoſe God had promiſed the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> a Monarchy, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> (ſay you) is not this Monarchy. The true conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, Ergo, <hi>The Kingdome of</hi> France <hi>is this Monarchie. The Church is this way which God promiſed it ſhould be.</hi> And it is ſo by the ſure guidance of him who is the <hi>way,</hi> and is with his <hi>Church</hi> ruling it until the continuation of the world. And ſo Chriſt is <hi>Regula regulans,</hi> and the Church <hi>Regula regulata.</hi> But being ruled by him there is not the leaſt danger that it will ſwerve from the VVord of God, and you may well follow ſuch a Guide with blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And ſtill I muſt mind you that I ſpeak of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church repreſented in a General Council confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Supreme Paſtor. This Church guiding by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible doctrine is this way, the Church Diffuſive (guided now by this Doctrine) was promiſed this Direct way: ſuch a way we were promiſed, a way ſo <hi>direct repreſented that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> The Scripture as ſome may conceive (for you dare not defend it) is not this way, for we ſee with our eyes, not onely fools, but alſo moſt learned men to erre groſly, and to follow moſt contradictory opinions, whileſt they profeſſe from their hearts to follow Scripture as neer as they can; the Scripture therefore is not this way,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40740:135"/> yet ſuch a way we muſt find to make Gods promiſe good. Nothing then with any probabilitie can be ſaid to be this way, but the Viſible Church of Chriſt.

               <note place="margin">Of my third Number.</note>3. Whence what you ſay againſt my third Number is eaſily anſwered. For all Religions agreeing that there muſt be one Judge of all Controverſies which either be, or may be in Religion, they muſt all give infallibility to their Judge as you your ſelves do, affirming Gods written Word to have plainly ſet down all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſo that no neceſſary controverſie can ſpring up but this Judge as you ſay doth decide it, which how falſe it is I ſhall fully ſhew chap. 3. All other Sectaries agreeing with you in this point, I underſtand not how you could ſay, that none but we held a Judge infallible. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without an infallible guide every man might proceed as if your faith were fallible, and ſo give an infallible aſſent to nothing; I did never ſay that without ſuch a judge we ſhould be free to follow (without any fault) our private judgement in holding what we will, as you inſinuate: but I ſaid, <hi>otherwiſe every man might be free to believe what he judged beſt, and ſo we ſhould have as many Religions as there be private and different judgements.</hi> Had you put theſe my words, you had not had a word to ſay. But you thought good to put ſuch words as you knew how to anſwer, and to leave out my true words, and to ſay nothing to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by which I proved them. And ſo that argument ſtill ſtanding in force, all that you ſay againſt your own ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is from the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You adde that you doe not ſay we ſhould follow our own judgement of diſcretion without means of regulating our judgements. But mark how in the next words you take away all means (for to take away all infallible means is to take away all means able to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40740:135"/> produce an infallible aſſent to faith) to have us ſurely guided in matters of faith, for you ſay, <hi>yet after we have peruſed the Definitions of Councils, we cannot reſign up our aſſents to their Dictates upon their account, but do examine (as the Bereans did) which Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid, untill we can find them reſolved into the infallible Rule of Holy Scripture:</hi> So you far from the ſpirit of that great Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> who ſaid, (Li. 1. Ep. 24.) <hi>I do profeſſe my ſelf to reverence the firſt foure Councils as I reverence the four Books of the Goſpel. And in like manner I do receive the fifth Council; whoſoever is of another mind, let him be an Anatheme.</hi> Thus he received all the lawful General Councils, which had been before him, for there were but five. But whereas you will not reſign up your aſſent to the Definitions of Councils, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you firſt can find them reſolved into the infallible Rule of Scripture; I muſt tell you firſt, that you will ſtill be ſtrongly preſſed, to ſhew upon what infallible principle you take Scripture by an infallible aſſent to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Word of God, and then you ſhall ſee how the whole Machin of your religion topleth &amp; tumbleth to the ground; for there cannot be a more groundles ground,<note place="margin">See of this chap. 3. Numb. 20.</note> then that ground upon which you (by rejecting the infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church) are forced to build your whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to wit, that you by the meer reading of the Scripture can by its Light (as you diſcover the Sun by its Light) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſo manifeſtly to be the undoubted Word of God, that this diſcovery ſufficeth to ground your infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this veritie. And it muſt be a far ſurer diſcovery then that by which we diſcover the Sunne by his Light; for this diſcovery can onely ground a natural certaintie, the other diſcovery muſt ground a ſupernatural, not certainly, but infallibly. Secondly, I muſt tell you, that theſe your proceedings to a private review, <hi>after you have peruſed the Definitions of the Councils to examine them until you find them reſolved into the infallible Rule of Scripture,</hi> (of which reſolution you make your private judgements the Iudge
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40740:136"/> to open awide gap to Hereſie, as I have ſhewed in the laſt chapter, Numb. 2. And for the importance of the matter I will here again further declare in an example which hereafter alſo will ſtand me in much uſe. Let us take an <hi>Arrian</hi> Cobler; to this man, this your Doctrine giveth the final review of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and you give him leave after he hath peruſed the definitions of this Council, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining God the Son to be of the ſelf ſame individual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with his Father) to examine them, until he find them reſolved into the infallible rule of Scripture. He doth examine them, and chiefly how they agree with that text, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> on which Text you<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 4. Number 57.</note> afterwards confeſs the infallibilitie of this definition to be chiefly grounded, and therefore St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did preſs it thrice. Now in the examining of the conformity of this definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with this text, the <hi>Arrian</hi> Cobler by his poor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is eaſily able to ſee (that which a wiſer man would yet ſee ſooner) that he is put upon a neceſſitie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how God the Son, and his <hi>Father are one,</hi> whether it be by affection onely as <hi>Arrians</hi> hold, or <hi>One</hi> in the ſelf ſame individual ſubſtance as the Councel defineth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring this, he calls to his mind that other text, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. v. 21. where Chriſt prayeth, <hi>That all his Diſciples may be one thing, as thou Father in me, and I in thee.</hi> Here will this Cobler ſay, (becauſe he hath often been inſtructed by his own Doctors) Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one thing,</hi> demandeth that his Diſciples <hi>may be one thing, as he and his Father are one thing.</hi> But he doth not demand that his Diſciples may be <hi>all one thing,</hi> in the ſelf ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſubſtance; Therefore (he concludes) Chriſt is not one thing in the ſelfe ſame individuall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with his Father, but one thing in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely as his Diſciples might come <hi>to be one thing.</hi> Falſe therefore (would he ſay) is this definition of the Council which cannot be reſolved into the infallible Word of God, in which all things neceſſary to ſalvation (as this
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40740:136"/> point is) are plainly ſet down, as this point is not, for this, is the plaineſt place, and yet conferring it with the other, I find it not evidently agreeing with the Definition of the Council, but rather evidently againſt it; by which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in this my Review, the Definition of the Council to be falſe. Moſt learned Sir, either convince this Cobler by ſome clearer Text of Scripture, which I am ſure (if this Text fail) is impoſſible, or elſe to the eternal good of miſled ſouls, confeſſe, that if once you give private men leave to make a Review of the Definitions of Councils, you can find no means upon earth to put an end unto our endleſs controverſies; the Scriptures alone not ſufficing for this end, as I ſhall ſhew in the next chap. without you take the Scriptures as they ſend us to the Church bidding us hear her, under pain of being accounted Publicans and Heathens.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thirdly, Learned Sir, I muſt tell you that this your Doctrine maketh the Definition of true Councils, and their final determinations to be indeed no Definitions nor final Determinations at all. For you make all thoſe great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church to aſſemble themſelves, from ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the world, onely to talk and diſcourſe about ſuch and ſuch points in controverſie, and to leave the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies themſelves undefined, and undermined, to be finally defined and determined onely by thoſe places of Scripture; which places as they could not before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Councils, ſo they cannot after the meeting of the Council fully define, determine, and decide theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. Now ſurely it is clear by theſe Acts of the firſt four Councils (which Councils your <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> holds for lawful) that the Fathers of theſe Councils never ſo much as doubted, but that they had all plenitude of power and authority from God to define, and finally to determine thoſe controverſies ſtill ariſing. And they had grievouſly wronged the world by Excommunicating all ſuch as ſhould gain-ſay what they had defined and determined, if Errour and Falſity, and Contradiction to Scripture
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40740:137"/> could have been found in their Definitions and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. What you touch concerning the <hi>Bereans,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer fully, chap. 3. Numb. 14.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whereas you adde fourthly, <hi>That the deciſions of the Church, though unprovided of infallibilitie, do yet oblige un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to peace, though their judgement cannot claim an undiſputed aſſent, yet the power they have from Chriſt doth require an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbance in the difference;</hi> you teach by words, what the deeds of your glorious Reformers have notoriouſly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Secondly, ſeeing that a general Council (as you in your firſt paper confeſs) is the higheſt Court on Earth, to hear and determine Controverſies, if her determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be erronious, and theſe erronious determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be to be accepted peaceably, reverently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance; in what a pittiful caſe ſhould Gods whole Church be, which having no higher Court, from which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief might be hoped, is bound to conform and ſubſcribe to erroneous definitions; and all preachers are ſilenced and obliged not to open their mouth againſt theſe errours. Did it beſeem the wiſedome of Chriſt to appoint ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his Church, which ſhould leave open ſo wide a gap to errors, which being by command from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt authoritie on earth, preached by ſo many, and not ſo much as contradicted by one, muſt needs increaſe to a wonderful height. Would any wiſe Law-makers proceed thus, if they could help it as well as Chriſt could, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in his Church that infallibility which you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it had thoſe two thouſand years before Scripture was written, and which this Church of Chriſt had before all the whole Canon of the New Teſtament was finiſhed, which was for the firſt fourty years of the Church.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Vain is your fear that we ſhould become Hypocrites in differing by one outward Act from our inward act of belief, for any wiſe man may inwardly perſwade himſelf, although I by my force of wit, cannot ſee how ſuch a point defined by a whole general Council ſhould be true;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40740:137"/> yet if I have wit, I cannot but perſwade my ſelf even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humane wiſedome, that ſo grave a judgement of a whole Council is far more likely to ſee the truth then my private judgement; and therefore rather to be interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orly imbraced. Again, I may diſcourſe thus. All the places alleadgeable againſt the Definitions of Councils, or of Scriptures, be places clear or not clear; if not clear, then clearly I am imprudent and impudent to oppoſe, in a point not clear, my private judgement of diſcretion againſt the publick judgement of all Chriſtendome, far more likely in a point not clear to hit upon the truth then I am. Now if theſe places alledgable againſt the Definitions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils be clear and evident, it is an evident and clear folly in me, to think that ſo wiſe an Aſſembly ſhould have ſo univerſal a blindneſſe, as that none of them ſhould be able to diſcover that which is clear and evident even in my ſhort ſight: See chap. 4. Numb. 51. Again I may and ought to know that the Holy Ghoſt hath promiſed an aſſiſtance to his Church ſufficient to ſecure it from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any error as I ſhall ſhew, chapter 4 Numb. 28.29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. And this Principle will beat down to the ground all Oppoſition which an humble ſoul can make, who will captivate her underſtanding in this caſe unto the obedience of faith as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And when you ask me, wherein you oppoſe general Councils? I anſwer, Firſt that you oppoſe them even in that moſt fundamental ground, upon which all Councils hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have ſtill ſuppoſed themſelves to ſet as Judges, with full Commiſſion to determine ſecurely all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, obliging all Chriſtians to conform to their Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by ſuch Cenſures as were ſtill held to be ratified in Heaven. Others will tell you divers other Oppoſitions you have with Councils, and even in this place you tell all how little you credit Councils when you charge them with ſpeaking contradictions. But when you come to ſpeak your mind more largely, you do your uttermoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40740:138"/> to make the world think that they have not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſurance that any Council was as yet a Lawful Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council. I need no further proof of theſe your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours then all thoſe manifold Objections which you put, and I anſwer in my 4. chapter Numb. 20.21.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And when you ask again why you are charged as if you were oppoſite to the true <hi>Catholike Church?</hi> I anſwer, Chriſt had in all ages ſince his time, a true <hi>Catholik Church,</hi> and conſequently he had ſuch a Church upon earth when your Reformation (as you call it) began. But at this your Reformation you did oppoſe in very many, and very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant points of doctrine, not onely the <hi>Roman,</hi> but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches upon earth: Therefore without doubt you oppoſed the <hi>truly Catholike Church</hi> in many, and very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant points. And in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> I tell you, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which is in lawful form) is unanſwerable. And when you ſay, that <hi>when you differ without oppoſition you keep the peace of the Church without queſtion.</hi> I anſwer, That your Reformers did apparently in many and moſt important points differ from all Churches Chriſt had then upon the Earth, in opinion of publick Doctrine; cenſuring ſuch and ſuch Points as they <hi>all held,</hi> to be <hi>Erronious, Superſtitious, oppoſite to the Word of God;</hi> and in this oppoſition you continue ſtill, though in this whole age you have not been able to name one age in this laſt thouſand years, in which <hi>Chriſt had a truly Catholike Church upon Earth,</hi> agreeing with you in thoſe many and moſt important points in which your Reformers taxed us to have oppoſed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And as for exterior diviſion you cannot name the Church upon earth from which you did not divide your ſelves at your Reformation. And I challenge you to tell me if you can, to what Church on Earth then viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you did joyn your ſelves, or who acknowledged you to be of their communion?</p>
            <p n="10">10. To prove yet further that we are not bound to ſubmit our judgements to the Church, you uſe (as you ſay)
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40740:138"/> my own argument, That we are bound to ſubmit our judgement onely to thoſe who can judge of the inward act. But Sir, I never ſaid any ſuch thing, for how know we whether the Scripture Writers, or the Apoſtles themſelves did know (without which knowledge they could not judge) of the interior Acts of all men, from their time to the end of the world? and yet all theſe men, upon due Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Doctrine, are obliged to ſubmit their interior acts to their Doctrine. But I ſaid that which you had rather a mind to miſtake, then anſwer. For I ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt ſhould have left a very miſerable Church, and ſhould have gathered a moſt heart-dis-united ſort of people, if after the reading of Scriptures</hi> (after which they wrangle ſo fiercely) <hi>He had left them no other Judge but their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgements ſubject to ſuch varietie in underſtanding the Scriptures; what Law-maker</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>was ever ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as to leave only a Book of Lawes to his Common-wealth without any living Judge, to whom all were to ſubmit;</hi> Then I added, <hi>True it is, that to ſubmit exteriorly to Temporal Judges ſufficeth, they being able onely to judge of the exterior man.</hi> Did I ſay this of general Councils? No, did I not, as it were to prevent your Objection, expreſly adde, <hi>But God</hi> (in whoſe name the Church teacheth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all which ſhe teacheth and commandeth) <hi>ſearcheth the heart and the reynes and looketh upon the minde (which is the ſeat of true or falſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;) This God, I ſay, chiefly exacteth that thoſe of his Church be of one faith interiorly, or elſe they be not of one faith; for faith eſſentially conſiſteth in the interior judgement. He hath all reaſon to exact that interiorly they be all of one faith. For he could not ſeriouſly have deſired their ſalvation, without he required of them</hi> (by way of moſt rigorous obligation) <hi>to do that which is ſo wholy neceſſary to ſalvation, that without it no man is ſaved. For without true faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi> This and much more to this effect, I preſſe there hotly, and yet I am not ſo much as anſwered coldly.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:40740:139"/>11. But you skip to my admiration at your doctrine which indeed giveth a very admirable licence to any Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to peruſe the Decrees of general Councils, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them too, if in his review of them he doth not find them Reſolved into the infallible text of clear Scripture. Of which Doctrine I have already ſpoken fully (Num. 4.) And I think I had reaſon to ſay that the wiſeſt man in the world is then moſt likely to erre, when, in his interiour judgement he goeth quite contrary to all Chriſtendome. Of this I have given a very clear Reaſon here in my 7. Number, which will ſtop your mouth from calling every where, to have me prove the Churches infallibility until you come to my 4 chapter; or if it doth not, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you in this place to turn unto it. And in the very next chapter I ſhall ſhew, that (though the Scripture be moſt infallible) yet it is not ſufficient by it ſelf alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you take it as it ſends us to the Church) to decide all controverſies. As for Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> did ever he oppoſe his judgement againſt the Definition of a lawful general Council? Nay, did it not appear by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſtanding for his Doctrine, that he might well know the true Church lawfully aſſembled under the lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor confirming their Acts would teach as he taught. And becauſe he knew this authority (relying on the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt) to be more then humane, he might well oppoſe a greater human authority.</p>
            <p>By the way it is ſtrange you ſhould carp at us for calling our ſelves <hi>Roman Catholiks,</hi> as if ſay you, no others were Catholikes, whereas to avoid this very ſtrife impertinent now to our purpoſe, I uſed that very name by which no others are excluded. And in this impertinent ſtrife you ſay many things of which you prove not one.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I paſſe to that which is pertinent to the purpoſe, that it is a very deſperate conſequence flowing from the premiſſes of your Doctrine, permitting any private perſon ſo to peruſe the Definitions of Councils, that he might
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40740:139"/> freely reject them in his private judgement (which is the ſeat of all Faith) if he judged them not to be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the infallible authority of Scripture, upon this ground, that we have nothing infallible but the Texts of Scripture, For theſe Texts being not able to decide all neceſſary controverſies (I ſtill adde unleſſe you take them as they ſend us to the Church by themſelves, as I ſhall fully ſhew in the next Chapter, it is clear that we ſhall remain diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without end, or poſſibility of end, unleſs God hath given an infallible aſſiſtance to the Church; wherefore not to grant ſuch an abſurdity, we are neceſſitated to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound thoſe Scriptures, promiſing that Chriſt will <hi>be with his Church unto the end of the world, That he will ſend them the Spirit of Truth to abide with them to teach them all Truth, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her. That we muſt hear her under pain of being accounted Publicans and Heathens, That ſhe is the Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> and diverſe others of which I ſpeak, chapter 4. to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an infallible aſſiſtance, for an aſſiſtance joyned with fallibilitie will ſtill leave us jarring, as appears by our own Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Being loath to ſtand too long to ſuch a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, you make a long impertinent diſcourſe about the peruſal of the collection of all the judgements of all the Fathers, of all Ages, every where. Good Sir, tell me what connexion hath the peruſal of every judgement, of every Father, of every Age, every where, with that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which I put of following theſe Cannons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils which make to the deciſions of thoſe moſt known controverſies about which we contend? Is the judgement of every Father of every Age, the judgement of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council? Why then do you run your ſelf out of breath in inpugning that which is nothing to our purpoſe, and which I never ſpake of, rather then in holding cloſe to the matter. But ſince you firſt bring the authority of Councils to a little more then nothing, and here again
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40740:140"/> the authority of the Fathers, to a little leſſe then nothing, in order to the ending of controverſies; this your violence againſt any provocation, to Antiquity, and conſent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Will give me leave to make this Treatiſe much ſhorter then at the beginning appeared poſſible. For it is evident out of your own words that it is to no end to deal with you out of Fathers, and I am reſolved to deal with no body but to ſome end. I will therefore humour you in this, and I will lay aſide all that might hereafter be ſaid concerning the Opinion of Fathers. But do not think that I do this, as if that what you here ſaid againſt the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Fathers, found any credit with me, or as if what you ſay were in the leaſt degree hard to be anſwered. For you your ſelf cannot be ignorant that we alledge plenty of ſuch Holy Fathers againſt you, as are confeſſed by your ſelves to have been the prime Doctors of the Primitive Church. And we find ſufficient of their works which have not periſhed, never taxed by any (but confeſſed Hereticks) to be erroneous in theſe points in which they hold with us, whereas their ſmall errours uſed preſently to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and cried down. We find alſo ſufficient plenty of ſuch works as never were ſuſpected to be baſtard pieces, or to have been corrupted; And it would make a learned man amazed to ask, as you do, <hi>How few of them have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our differences?</hi> Are you ignorant that our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Coccius</hi> hath filled a great, and a very great double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome onely with the words of Holy Fathers oppoſite to your Doctrine in thoſe points in which we differ. <hi>Gualterus</hi> did ſingle out twelve points (in which our chief differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do conſiſt.) And he ſheweth (in his Chronicle at the end of every age from Chriſts time to this,) ſufficient plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Holy Fathers, to Demonſtrate, what the prime Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church (followed by the people,) did believe in every one of thoſe Ages, concerning theſe very prime points, in which we differ from you. The Author of the <hi>Progeny of Catholikes and Proteſtants,</hi> handling a part all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40740:140"/> our main differences, doth in all theſe points, give you the very words, of your own chief Doctors, clearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a great number of Holy Fathers, directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite unto them in each one of thoſe points. Do but pleaſe to look at the end of this Author upon his <hi>Table of Books and Chapters,</hi> and you may find that which I have ſaid verified, in what point or points you pleaſe. Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs then is the whole Diſcourſe againſt arguing out of Holy Fathers. And indeed your Doctors would fain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute out of Scriptures onely, becauſe they find it to be true that the Scriptures alone cannot decide many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, but by ſome Interpretation or other they think themſelves able to elude the force of arguments drawn from Scriptures onely: the ſayings which are not in Scripture, are in no caſe receivable by them, whereas indeed, there is no good got by diſputing of Texts of Scriptures, but either to make men ſick or mad, as our adverſaries may daily ſee by their fruitleſs Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates with the Anabaptiſts, the Sabatharians, and other upſtart Sectaries. But the Church of God is the Kings high way, by which a man is ſure to travail to truth. There ought therefore to be no appealing to Scriptures, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting out of them only, ſince by that means, either nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide will be victorious, or it is a hazard whether. Theſe things you might have learned from the ancient Fathers if you had regarded their Doctrine, yet ſince their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath ſo low a place in your eſteem in order to finding out the truth, to humor you, I will lay aſide all that might be ſaid out of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>I cut then off (by your own conſent) all you ſay concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the Criſis of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> concerning S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> yet have I a great mind to tell you that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſſed exceeding well that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> be thoſe two vertues which made S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (and ought to make us) ſubmit to general Councils, as a prime part of our bounded duty; humility, whereſoever it is found is the <hi>Actus imperans</hi> of a moſt ſubmiſſive Obedience to the Orders of thoſe,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40740:141"/> whom under pain of damnation we are to obey. Becauſe the Devils had not this Humility in ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, and the obedience due to him, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is aſcribed to pride, which for the ſame reaſon is ſtyled, <hi>The Mother of Hereſie.</hi> Now as Humility bringeth with her this neceſſary ſubmiſſion in the interior, ſo Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the Vertue which will be ſure to ſee that peace and Unity be kept exteriorly in the Church. Grant this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to all Councils and we have done.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <note place="margin">Of my fourth and fifth Number.</note>15. God on his part hath given us an excellent means to be ſurely guided in our interior (in which faith conſiſts) by following the Church the Kings high way ſurely leading to Truth; <hi>take away this means</hi> (recommended ſo often for this end by Scripture) and you ſhall ſee how pittifully we are left unprovided in order to exterior Unity. But you preſſe to have my diſcourſe to this effect drawn into a ſyllogiſm, which you do for me. But I hope to do it yet more clearly for my ſelf in this manner. Under pain of damnation all are bound to agree in this; that every one interiorly giveth an infallible aſſent to all ſuch points as are neceſſary to be believed for ſalvation. But all can never be brought to agree in giving interiourly this infallible Aſſent to all ſuch points, without they ſubmit their Aſſent to ſome living Judge indued with infallibility: Therefore all can never be brought to agree in that, in which they are bound to agree under pain of damnation, without they all ſubmit their interior aſſent to ſome living Judge indued with infallibility. The firſt Propoſition is clear; becauſe all are obliged to pleaſe God, and to have that <hi>faith, without which it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi> The ſecond Propoſition is proved thus. An infallible aſſent cannot be built but upon ſubmiſsion to an infallible authority, and no other infallible authority ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to breed this agreement in their interior aſſent to all points neceſſary, can be aſſigned but the authority of the Church. The Authority of the Scripture, though infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40740:141"/> doth not give us clear Texts to ground our infallible aſſent upon them in all points neceſſary to ſalvation, as I ſhall ſhew in the next chapter. And we ſee with our eyes thoſe who ſubmit to this authority of Scripture as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to diſagree mainly in theſe very points; for one think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his conſcience theſe Scriptures to be underſtood one way, another thinketh in his conſcience they are to be underſtood one other way, &amp; this other is licenſed by you to differ from the former, for you licence ſuch a man to differ even from the greateſt authority upon Earth, to wit, a general Council, much more eaſie muſt you be to licenſe him to differ from an other private man: and that other private man hath as good ground to differ from the other. What poſſible means is here of Union in the interior man in which faith onely doth conſiſt. What you adde of God his ſufficiently providing for his Church by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely, is in this ſence true, that in Scripture we read that we are <hi>to hear the Church,</hi> not that Scripture alone by her ſelf endeth all our controverſies as partly hath been proved, but ſhall now more copiouſly be performed in my next chapter, in which you ſhall find all that you adde in this place preſently anſwered, after I have fully ſet down the ſtate of the queſtion.</p>

               <hi>The third CHAPTER.</hi> That ſeeing Scripture alone doth not decide all things neceſſary to ſalvation, there muſt be a living Judge.</head>
            <p n="1">1. YOu deliver your Opinion in your anſwer to my third Number page 12. <hi>As towards controverſies we ſay that Chriſt hath ſufficiently provided for the ſalvation of man in regard of means of Knowledge without an infallible
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40740:142"/> Judge on Earth, becauſe things neceſſary are plainly ſet down in Scripture.</hi> And in another place you ſay, <hi>what is not plainly delivered in Scripture is thereby ſignified not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> Of this your opinion no proof was given by you untill you come unto this preſent place. Here then I will begin to diſcuſſe this Queſtion: And firſt I will take leave to ſtate this Queſtion a little more fully, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your Aſſertion then is, <hi>That all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are plainly ſet down in Scripture.</hi> In this Aſſertion there be 2 things which need a full and diſtinct declaration. The firſt is to declare theſe words, <hi>Neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> The ſecond to declare thoſe other words, <hi>Plainly ſet down in Scripture.</hi> And firſt concerning thoſe words <hi>Neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> they muſt of neceſſity be underſtood ſo, that all things are plainly ſet down in Scripture, which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Firſt,</hi> to the Univerſal Church as it is a communitie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> all things which are neceſſary to all States, and Degrees that muſt needs be in this community. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> all things neceſſary to every ſingle perſon bound to be of this community. As for the firſt, the Church being intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a community diffus'd through the whole World, and intended for a Perpetuity, muſt, by infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be plainly told in what manner ſhe is in all times and places to be provided of lawful Paſtors, and that with perpetual Succeſſion; and what power theſe Paſtors have either in reſpect of one another, or in reſpect to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flocks, and what Lawes they may make, either ſingle in regard of their flocks, or aſſembled in regard of the whole community; and how many, to this effect muſt be aſſembled; who muſt call their aſſembly, who perſide in it, when it is to be accounted lawful when an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſembly. Whether the Precepts of this aſſembly oblige under pain of damnation, to the keeping (for Example) of any Feaſt, as <hi>Chriſtmaſſe, Aſcenſion,</hi> or any Faſt, as the Faſt of <hi>Lent,</hi> of <hi>Chriſtmaſſe Eve,</hi> and to this
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40740:142"/> community it is alſo neceſſary to know what publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may and ought to be impoſed upon all, and when all are bound to be preſent at it. What Sacraments are to be adminiſtred, by whom, when the people are bound to uſe them, and how often, and in what manner and form they muſt be Adminiſtred. All theſe things are neceſſary to the Chuch as a community, and yet there is not one of all theſe things plainly ſet down in Scripture, whence very many and very important differences be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, all undecidable by Scripture. Some of you contend according to Scripture that there muſt be Biſhops with ſuch and ſuch Power and Authority, and that without them you can have no true Prieſts or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and without theſe no true Sacraments, things ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſalvation of all men. Others anſwer in the words of your own doctrine, <hi>What is not plainly delivered in Scripture, is thereby ſignified not to be neceſſary.</hi> But it is not plainly delivered in Scripture that the Church ſhould be governed by Biſhops <hi>with ſuch and ſuch authoritie.</hi> That Prieſts ſhould be Ordained with ſuch and ſuch a Form, that none but Prieſts ſhould have Power to bleſſe the Bread, adminiſter the Sacraments; That this Bread muſt be Wheat-bread or Barley, or Oaten or Peaſe-bread. Therefore all theſe things are ſignified not to be neceſſary. The ſame Argument might be made of other ſuch like Controverſies, which certainly be no leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then the former to be decided; Though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Doctrine none of them ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; Or, if neceſſary, they ſhould be decidable by plain Scripture, and then your Doctours could not jarre about them, as they doe. Some of you will have no words at all neceſſary to the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſme, ſome will have ſuch kinde of words, and others, words very different from them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:40740:143"/>
            <p>Secondly, to ſpeak now of ſuch things as are of ſtrict neceſſity to certain men, of certain ſtates and degrees in the Church. Your Biſhops muſt know how to ordain Prieſts, and with what form of words or actions. Where ſhall they find this plainly ſet down in Scripture? They muſt alſo know whether they can lawfully permit women to baptize at all, or baptize in neceſſitie onely, and not out of it? Whether they may permit women or lay-men to bleſſe the bread, and diſtribute the Sacrament, ſeeing that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Do this all;</hi> not plainly expreſſing how far theſe his words extended themſelves. Prieſts muſt know what kind of Ordination is neceſſary for their Function, what commſſion is neceſſary for their lawful Miſſions, and whether it can be granted by Lay-men, or no? as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their power to make and adminiſter Sacraments, and yet none of theſe are plainly ſet down in Scripture, and endleſſe controverſies there be about them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thirdly, divers of the former things not ſet down plainly in Scripture, are neceſſary to be known by all men all being obliged to ſerve God in a true Church, having a lawful ſucceſſion of true Paſtors truly ordain'd themſelves, and truly ordaining their Prieſts, who muſt be known to Adminiſter true Sacraments in their true matter and form, preaching alſo the Word of God by lawful Miſſion. It is neceſſary to the ſalvation of every man to believe and doe ſomethings, and not to do ſome other things not plainly ſet down in Scripture. Every one is to believe ſome things diſtinctly. Now which theſe things be, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Scriptures expreſſe not. Every one is bound not to work upon the Sunday. Every one is bound not to have two wives at one time, not alſo to marry within ſuch and ſuch a degree of conſanguinity. Where be all theſe things plainly ſet down in Scripture? Of divers other things we ſhall yet ſay more. Yet even hence appeareth how many endleſſe difficulties theſe words of yours <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſalvation</hi> bring with them.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:40740:143"/>5. Other endleſſe difficulties be ſuperadded by thoſe other words <hi>Plainly ſet down in Scripture. Firſt,</hi> to prove a point plainly ſet down in Scripture, ſo that I infallibly know the undoubted true ſence of it, I muſt firſt know ſuch a book to be the true, and undoubted Word of God, which (as I ſhall ſhew, Numb, 20.) cannot be known by Scripture, at leaſt by thoſe who can truly ſwear that they are no more able, by the reading of the book of <hi>Numbers</hi> for example, to diſcover in it any Divine Light, ſhewing it to be true Scripture, more then they diſcover in the books of <hi>Judith</hi> or <hi>Toby</hi> ſhewing them to be true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they muſt infallibly ſhew that this very Verſe, in which I find this point is not thruſt in among other true parts of Scripture, or ſome word changing the ſenſe, either thruſt in, or left out in this Verſe; and this they muſt know infallibly. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> after all this they muſt yet further know, and that infallibly, whether theſe true and uncorrupted words of Scripture be taken in this place in their common ſenſe, or taken Figuratively, or ſpoken myſtically of ſome other thing. Now how is it poſſible by Scripture onely to come to have an infallible knowledge of this, for it dependeth merely on the ſecret free will of God to uſe theſe words here either Myſtically or Figuratively, or in their plain vulgar ſenſe. To know, and that infallibly, This ſecret free-will of God, I muſt have a Revelation, and ſuch a one as no doubt can be made of it. Where find I this Revelation in Scripture? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> your learned <hi>Sanctius, De Sacra Scriptura, (Col.</hi> 409.) having ſaid, <hi>That Holy Scripture in theſe things which are neceſſary to ſalvation is clear;</hi> he aſſigns no fewer <hi>then nineteen Rules neceſſary to the true knowledge thereof;</hi> beſides the <hi>having the Spirit of God, and the reading the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and the underſtanding the words and places thereof.</hi> And <hi>Scharpius in Curſu Theologico de Scriptoribus controverſ.</hi> 8. <hi>P.</hi> 44. aſſigneth <hi>twenty Rules</hi> for the underſtanding the Scripture, <hi>which unleſs they be kept we cannot but erre.</hi> But
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40740:144"/> ſurely it is very eaſie to keep them. No ſuch matter; For he exacts <hi>to know Original Languages to diſcuſs the words, Phraſes, and Hebraiſms, to confer the places which are like, and unlike to one another, &amp;c.</hi> Tell me now, do all theſe, and the former Rules, ſhew a plain, eaſie way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility; eſpecially, we having no ſure knowledge that all theſe fallible Rules, will at laſt produce infallibility. Good God! <hi>Is this the way promiſed to be ſo direct unto us that fools cannot erre by it. Fifthly,</hi> I muſt adde a ſaying of your ſo much eſteemed <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> who (in his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.) ſaith, <hi>No more certain Signe that a point is not evident, then when honeſt, and underſtanding, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men, and ſuch as give themſelves Liberty of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after mature conſideration of the matter, do differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</hi> About how many points do you, and your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers differ? which I have in this Chapter ſhewed to be points mainly neceſſary to Salvation, which according to this Rule of knowing what is evident, what not, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently not ſet down plainly in Scripture: And to ſpeak the plain truth, this ground upon which you, and yours are ſtill forced to ſtand, ſo to withſtand the neceſſity of one Infallible living Judge, ſeemeth a plain Paradox.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In one ſenſe (as I have often noted) we ſtill grant all things neceſſary to Salvation to be ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, in theſe Texts in which the Scripture bids us <hi>Hear the Church,</hi> and that <hi>under pain of being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (by a ſentence ratified in Heaven) <hi>Publicans and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and <hi>that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt Her;</hi> by any falſe Doctrine, that <hi>She is Pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi> That <hi>the Holy Ghoſt abideth with her for ever teaching her all Truth, That Gods Spirit ſhall not depart from the Mouth of her ſeed, nor her ſeeds ſeed.</hi> And ſuch like places which I ſhall in due place (Chap. 4. Num. 58. to 64.) ſhew, moſt forcibly to prove this verity. And the very reading of them, ſheweth them to be no leſs plain, and cleer to this purpoſe, then thoſe places,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40740:144"/> which you cry out to be evident for the proof of every point which is neceſſary to ſalvation. And I am ſure you can bring no ſuch evident Texts for all, yea, for any of theſe points, which I have already ſaid in this chapter not to be evidently ſet down in Scripture, though they be of prime neceſſity, as others alſo which I ſhall by and by adde. The Scripture alone by it ſelf, (in which ſenſe you ſpeak) doth not (as theſe places will demonſtrate) ſet down all things neceſſary to ſalvation, yet ſhe ſetteth down (and that firſt more clearly then ſhe doth ſet down many ſuch neceſſary points) a Command to go to the Church for our full inſtruction. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was taught all things neceſſary for his knowledge by thoſe few words, (<hi>Act</hi> 9.6.) <hi>Goe into the City, and it ſhall be told what thou muſt do.</hi> That all might ſee this City of the Church, he placed it on a Mountain, whence all neceſſary points are delivered from a living Oracle, ſpeaking ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, that no doubt can remain of the true ſenſe, or if there be made any doubt of any thing of importance, this doubt will preſently be cleared by ſome new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, authentically notified unto us by our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Doctours which God gave us (as the Scripture ſaith) <hi>That we ſhould not be Children waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carried about with the wind of falſe doctrine with circumvention of error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. But to go on with your Aſſertion, all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation (ſay you) are plainly ſet down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. This is your main foundation of Faith, making you not onely to take Scriptures, but to take Scriptures onely, and nothing but Scriptures for the ground of your Faith, this ground I ſay muſt needs, be plainly ſet down in Scripture, otherwiſe according to your own words, <hi>What is not plainly delivered in Scripture is thereby ſignified not to be neceſſary.</hi> Again, if this be not plainly ſet down in Scripture, it will remain uncertain to us, whether God did intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have all ſuch neceſſary things taught us by the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40740:145"/> Scripture taken by it ſelf alone; or whether God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scripture for divers other ends, provinding ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for this end by ſending us to the Church for our further inſtruction. That then which I call for again, and again, is to have plainly ſet down to me in Scripture, <hi>that God intended by the Scriptures taken by themſelves all alone, to teach us with infallibility all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> ſhew me the Texes.</p>
            <p n="8">8. You go about to ſhew me them. And firſt you preſs the ſecond time that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2.15, 16. Take for my firſt anſwer that which I gave you when you firſt alledged this place, chap. 1. Numb. 3. And you muſt pardon me if I ſay that place ſpeaketh of Scriptures inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the Church, to whom I think it is fitter to give this Office, then to let every Cobler uſurp it as I have ſhewed you do, chap. 1. Numb. 2. and chap. 2. Numb. 4. the Scriptures thus profaned, and by ſuch interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons truly diſcanoned (as I may ſay) are rather ſubject to that effect which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his Epiſtles, (according to St. <hi>Peter</hi>) had with ſome men, that is, they are ſubject to be depraved by them to the perdition of their Interpreters: where (by the way) you are again to take notice, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Interpreters depraved thoſe places of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to their damnation, though theſe places were hard, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, and conſequently theſe places, did not (according to you doctrine) contain points neceſſary to ſalvation. Whence you ſee that your proceedings in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing much liberty of Interpretations even in hard points may eaſily prove damnable. It was then true which I told you in another place. That though the Scripture be a moſt right Rule, yet it is very commonly ſo crookedly applied, that we ſtand in need of a better ſecurity of the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it (in which the very carnel of the Letter doth conſiſt) then we have of the interpretation (finally ſtood unto) made by the private judgement of our own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know your Anſwer is that it is accidental to this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40740:145"/> Rule to be miſapplied, and that this cannot infringe the authoritie of Scripture. It doth not indeed infringe the Authority of Scripture uſed as God would have it uſed, with due ſubmiſſion to the publick interpretation of his Church. Otherwiſe, not for want of infallibilitie in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the abundance of fallibility in our private judgements of diſcretion, it followeth, that we poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhall be ſubject to be miſled moſt pittifully, without God doth provide us of an infallible interpreter. Neither is this to ſpeak more irreverently of Scriptute then Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpoke of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles. Nothing more clear then that the words of Scripture are capable of ſeveral ſenſes, and when the ſenſes be ſeveral, it muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the inward and moſt ſecret intention of God to have had an intention to uſe theſe words to ſuch or ſuch a ſenſe onely, or to both if he pleaſed. How ſhall we infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly know Gods ſecret intention but by an interpreter, having infallible aſſiſtance from the ſame Holy Spirit, who aſſiſted thoſe who did write the Scripture. Wherefore we cannot but wonder to ſee, how much ſcope you give to ſuch poor creatures as ignorant men are, by thruſting the whole Bible into every mans hands, and inveſting him with ſo ample a faculty to interpret it, without any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſubmiſſion to the Church (although the interior judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be the very ſeat of damnable error, or ſaving Truth) that he may follow in his judgement what he ſhall ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge to be trueſt. In ſo much, that he may in his own interpretation, ſtand out in his judgement, againſt the interpretations of whole General Councils. And yet this very ſelf ſame man is wiſely by you ſent to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <hi>And any Miniſter of the Goſpel</hi> ſay you (but I muſt not ſay, (Any General Council) <hi>is able competently, through the Scripture to direct the People to their happineſs. And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was inſpired to this purpoſe.</hi> Happy Miniſters! Happy people led ſo ſecurely! Only unhappy miſled people are we, who had rather ſay, <hi>The Scripture was inſpired, that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40740:146"/> through it General Councils might ſecurely direct the people to their happineſs,</hi> then ſay with my good adverſary, <hi>any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel is able competently through the Scripture to direct the people to their happineſſe, And the Scriptures were inſpired to this purpoſe.</hi> Doe but allow me this to the Church, that it can competently through the Scripture direct the people their happineſs, and we will not contend with you whether this competent direction to happineſs ſhall be called an infallible direction or no: though we think it moſt certain, that no fallible direction can compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently direct the people to happineſs. Now becauſe by the way, I did ſay our Church could not erre <hi>in damnative errors,</hi> you conceive me to grant that it may erre in points <hi>not damnative.</hi> No Sir, when I ſaid theſe words, I did only take, and ſubſume that, which you your ſelves moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grant unto the Church, that it cannot erre in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native matters. This alone giveth her a main advantage over any Miniſter or any private Interpreter. This alone giveth a demonſtrable reaſon, why we ſhould not follow our own interpretations, which may be damnative; as thoſe interpretations were which ſome men made of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to their own perdition, as Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaith. And ſurely ſuch Interpretations are then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be damnative when they are flatly contrary to the Interpretations of the Church. What Commiſſion the Church had for her infallibilitie I ſhall ſhew in due place.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew it more fully I will preſs again your Text and give a ſecond anſwer unto it by anſwering the words following, which are. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, and it is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction</hi> (ſo your Bible reads) <hi>for inſtruction in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> Is it given by Inſpiration? yes. What prove you from hence, but that you and yours have a notable Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in not concluding contradictorily. You ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40740:146"/> But all Doctrine given by Inſpiration from God containeth plainly all things neceſſary to ſalvation. Therefore all Scripture contains plainly all things neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> &amp; it doth this taking the word, <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and the word <hi>plainly</hi> as I have ſhewed they muſt be taken in the beginning of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Well but you will hit of it by and by, after three or foure Conſequences of no Conſequence. For you goe thus on, <hi>Is not all Scripture profitable for Doctrine?</hi> Yes, in a high Degree it teacheth moſt eminent Vertues, and among other Vertues it teacheth moſt wholeſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and obedience to the Church, and by her all things neceſſary for ſalvation. And thus the Scripture by her ſelf alone is very profitable. But Sir, I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a Contradictory Concluſion. Deduce me from theſe words, this Conſequence <hi>Ergo, God intended by the Scriptures alone to teach us with infallibilitie all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to ſalvation, or all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture</hi> ſtill underſtanding theſe words as I in the beginning ſhewed they muſt be underſtood. Go on. <hi>Is it not profitable for reproof?</hi> Yes Sir. But where is the contradictorie Concluſion I expected? <hi>Is it not profitable for correction?</hi> Yes. But <hi>I want</hi> ſtill this Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Concluſion. <hi>Is it not profitable for inſtruction in Righteouſneſſe?</hi> Yes. And now all your Powder is ſpent, and you have not hit the marke, for I have not yet the Contradictorie Concluſion I ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Hear now a true Contradictorie Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt your ſelfe out of this Text. That which in this Text is ſaid onely to be <hi>profitable</hi> for theſe ends, is not thereby ſaid <hi>to be ſufficient even to theſe ends,</hi> and yet much leſſe <hi>ſufficient to end all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies neceſſary to Salvation by it ſelf alone.</hi> But the Scripture in this Text, is only ſaid <hi>to be profitable</hi> to theſe ends here expreſſed. Therefore it is not hereby ſaid <hi>to be ſufficient and that by it ſelf alone</hi> even to theſe ends, and much leſs <hi>by it ſelf alone ſufficient to end all Controverſies
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40740:147"/> neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> plainly ſetting down what is to be held in all things neceſſary to Salvation. Again (for a third anſwer.) You cannot ſay St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke theſe words of the New Teſtament, which for ſome fourty years, after Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke theſe words was not finiſhed. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this Text doth not ſo much as ſpeak of the whole Canon of Scripture, whence he is moſt weakly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prove from hence that the whole Canon contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth clearly all things neceſſary to ſalvation. Again when this is proved, it is manifeſt, that part of the whole Canon is loſt. How then know you that ſome neceſſary points, not delivered in other parts of Scripture, were not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in theſe parts of Scripture which have periſhed, and ſo are come not to be extant in writing? I deſire your Anſwer to this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Text to prove this is <hi>Hebrews.</hi> 4, 12. <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper then any two edged ſword, pierceing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and it is a diſcoverer of the thoughts and the intents of the heart.</hi> Here is the Text, but where is the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory concluſion inferring, and that evidently, <hi>That it is plainly ſet down in Scripture, that the Scripture by it ſelf alone is ſufficient to decide all neceſſary Controverſies?</hi> You argue thus. <hi>If you ſay the Word of God is a dead Letter it cannot ſpeak, it is denied. If you ſay the Word of God cannot act, it is denied it is active</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But Sir, What if I ſay the Word of God ſpeaks and ſpeaks clearly many moſt profitable things, and that it ſets down many moſt rare examples of Vertue, with excellent Principles, and Documents, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to the ſame in a manner moſt forceable to ſtrike fire out of a flinty heart; do I not, when I ſay this, ſay all that you have ſaid? And when I have ſaid all this, where is that evident conſequence directly concluding, <hi>That all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly decided by Scripture alone?</hi> But to come at laſt to this Conſequence you tell me, <hi>If you ſay it cannot decide Controverſies what is ſaid here?
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40740:147"/> It is ſharper then any two edged ſword.</hi> But good Sir, I pray, to what uſe is the Word of God ſaid to be ſharper then any two edged ſword? can you ſhew me any one clear, and evident ſyllable in this Text, telling me plainly, that this ſharpneſſe is in order, not onely <hi>to decide Controverſies, but alſo all neceſſary Controverſies, and to do this by it ſelf alone.</hi> Where is then your contradictory Concluſion? But I will from hence directly conclude, that according to your own doctrine Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſay in this Text, that the Word of God, is by it ſelf alone ſufficient to decide all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary controverſies, which I prove. The Word of God according to your own doctrine was not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all neceſſary controverſies before the whole Canon of the Scripture was compleatly finiſhed. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid this of the Word of God before the Canon of the Scripture was compleatly finiſhed; Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid this of the Word of God before the Word of God, was of it ſelf alone ſufficient to decide all neceſſary controverſies. Therefore, <hi>then it had been falſe</hi> to ſay the Word of God had been ſufficient to this end. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not then ſay ſo. Again thoſe words ſpoke not of the Word of God blunted with thoſe interpretations which your opinion licenſeth, but of the VVord of God applied according to the Divinely-ſpirited interpretation of the Church, in whoſe hands, hands guided by the Holy Ghoſt, this Word of God is ſo managed for the deciſion of controverſies, that it is ſharper then any two edged ſword. For her declarations of Scripture be not fallible, but proceed from the ſame Spirit by which the Scripture was made as I ſhall ſhew. And ſo here is no fear of miſſing the right interpretation. You may ſecurely ſubmit your interior aſſent to the guidance of the Holy Ghoſt. Where this guidance is neglected, there we ſee with our eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in moſt main points dayly multiplied, and yet the Bible dayly conſulted, and not one of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ſo much as leſſened, but ſtill encreaſed more
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40740:148"/> and more. In theſe dayes he muſt put out his eyes who will not ſee this.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I have now anſwered the Texts you alledged in this place, but to the end that all the Texts, which you thought fitteſt to alledge to prove the moſt important Verity, may here be muſtered up together, and their whole force ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the full, I will ſet down here all the Texts which you alledge to this purpoſe. You then (page 52. in your anſwer to my 14. Numb.) urge, that Chriſt biddeth us <hi>ſcarch the Scriptures.</hi> But Sir, firſt you are to prove that theſe words clearly and evidently muſt of neceſſity be taken in the Imperative Mood, for without you do this, you can never prove evidently from hence that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Command, and to prove this, eſpecially evidently, is impoſſible. Becauſe both the Greek and the Latine word is as truly and properly, and vulgarly the Indicative Mood as the Imperative, and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlatour might, if he had pleaſed, moſt faithfully have tranſlated theſe words thus <hi>you do ſearch the Scriptures.</hi> And Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> holdeth this to be the true ſenſe <hi>L.</hi> 3. in <hi>Jo. C.</hi> 4. and your own great Dr. <hi>Beza</hi> holds the ſame. Secondly, ſuppoſe your Tranſlator hath hit upon the right ſenſe, and that Chriſt did indeed bid them ſearch the Scriptures, becauſe they clearly teſtifie that one point when he was the Meſſias, yet all this will help you to make no better conſequence then you made before. And what a pritty concluſion is this. <hi>Chriſt bids us ſearch the Scriptures becauſe they teſtifie clearly that one point of which he ſpoke; Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teſtifie clearly all that is neceſſary to be believed in any point of Controverſie neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> And no better is this conſequence, <hi>Chriſt biddeth us ſearch the Scriptures, therefore we are to attend them alone,</hi> we are not to attend to the Voyce of <hi>John,</hi> nor the Voyce from Heaven bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to hear him, not to his own preaching, and miracles. Is not this alſo a good conſequence? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>if Women will learn any thing let them ask their Husbands at
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40740:148"/> home,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.35. Ergo, <hi>women are not to learn of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Your fourth Text is, <hi>You erre not knowing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> Good Sir, give me now a Contradictory Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Shall it be this, <hi>Therefore all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are plainly ſet down in Scripture;</hi> or rather this; <hi>Therefore all things neceſſary to ſalvation are not plainly ſet down in Scripture;</hi> For this is the far ſtronger conſequence from theſe words. For had all things been plainly ſet down, they ſhould not have erred; But they erred, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things were not plainly ſet down. Again, they might erre in the knowledge of the Scriptures, becauſe in the reading of them they did follow their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interpretations, which is the moſt ready way to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, eſpecially when men oppoſe the publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Church, as I ſhewed chap. 1. Numb. 3. laſt words ſaith the <hi>Bereans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Your firſt Text, is 2 Pet 1. v. 19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of Propheſie, whereunto you do well that you take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place untill the day dawn and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your ſoules.</hi> Your proof from this Text is juſt as weak, as the proof from the laſt Text but one; for juſt as that Text, ſo alſo this ſaith that, that one point, of Jeſus his being the true Son of God, and the Meſſias, might clearly be found in the Scripture. How will you inferre? Ergo <hi>All things neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are plainly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> becauſe one thing is plainly ſet down. Every Veritie ſet down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is a moſt ſure infallible Veritie. But, whence have you that every Verity neceſſary to ſalvation is ſet down in the Scripture? And yet again, where have you that all things neceſſary to Salvation were then ſet down plainly in Scripture when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpoke theſe words, which he ſpoke many years before the whole Canon of Scripture was finiſhed? But before the whole Canon was finiſhed it was falſe to ſay, <hi>All
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40740:149"/> things neceſſary to ſalvation were clearly ſet down in Scripture;</hi> Therefore if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid this in this Text, he had ſaid that which was falſe, Therefore, It is falſe that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in this Text, that all things neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were plainly ſet down in Scripture.</p>

                  </gap>s, They received the Word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures dayly, whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> Good Sir, whileſt this text is now freſh in our minds, ſhew me here any one evident clear ſyllable which ſaith, the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> did ſearch the Scriptures before they believed Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Nay is it not firſt ſaid, <hi>They received the Word with all readineſſe of mind,</hi> to wit, they received the Word as many other thouſands did (whoſe proceedings you can never prove leſs laudable then the <hi>Bereans</hi>) upon thoſe Motives which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> propoſed unto them, before they ſearched the Scriptures, and being by theſe motives and inſtructions well illightned to underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they for their further comfort and confirmation ſearched the Scriptures dayly to ſee whether they teſtified the ſame point: and this one point of our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being clearly in Scripture, perhaps Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might bid them ſearch in ſuch and ſuch texts for it. Neither hence is it made evident that the Old Teſtament was thruſt into every mans hand of the <hi>Bereans,</hi> but that they deputed their chief Doctours to make this ſearch, and that for this one point onely. Whence (as I ſaid before) your conſequence from hence is very weak; That all points neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this one point was ſo. Yea, when the <hi>Bereans</hi> did ſearch the Scriptures, no part of the New Teſtament was written, how ſtrangely then do you prove from their ſearch of the Old Scripture to find one point ſet down clearly, that all points neceſſary to be found are ſet down plainly, now the new Scripture is written.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Having now examined all the Texts upon which
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40740:149"/> you did ground that main point, that all things neceſſary to decide all controverſies are plainly ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and having found this point no where plainly ſet down, I from hence plainly conclude, that the belief of this point is not plainly neceſſary; And I conclude this by your own words, <hi>That what is not plainly ſet down in Scripture is thereby ſignified not to be neceſſary;</hi> We are not therefore obliged to take the Scripture for our only Judge of controverſies, for where is this Obligation plainly ſet down in Scripture? And for ought we can yet ſee there may be many prime controverſies no where plainly deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yea or ſo much as lightly inſinuated in Scripture. And yet the Scripture wanteth not that glory of being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to decide all imaginable controverſies, becauſe ſhe teacheth us that Chriſt hath erected a <hi>Church, built upon a Rock the pillar and ground of truth, having the Spirit of truth abiding with her to teach her all truths?</hi> Frivolous is that Objection which ſaith, <hi>If it be a point neceſſary to ſalvation to believe that the Church is to decide with infallible authority all our controverſies we ſhould find this plainly ſet down in Scripture.</hi> Becauſe as we have proved all this while, all points neceſſary to ſalvation be not plainly ſet down in Scripture, even ſuch points as might import the ending of all controverſies: to wit this your grand point, <hi>All things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture;</hi> Yea the Texts which I bring chap. 4. are a hundred times more clear to prove that the Church is to decide all our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, then that the Scripture by it ſelf alone is to decide them, as any man may ſee by the attentive reading of theſe my Texts there and your Texts here. See there Numb. 58. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Though it might evidently ſerve to prove againſt you, That all things neceſſary to Salvation be not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in Scripture, that this very prime point is not plainly ſet down in Scripture, yet I have already in the beginning of this Chapter brought many other ſtrong
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40740:150"/> proofs to which according to good order I ſhould here add thoſe many more which I am yet to bring. But you interpoſe ſo many things by the way, that I am forced to defer thoſe other arguments. Yet that my Reader may know briefly what they are, and how many (and ſo read them here if he pleaſe,) I thought good to tell him that I prove yet further many neceſſary points to Salvation not to be plainly ſet down in Scripture. For we find not there ſet down evidently. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether it be damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to work upon the <hi>Sunday?</hi> ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 39. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the King be the head of the Church? ſee <hi>Num.</hi> 41. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Which books be the undoubted true Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scriptures? ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 42. And <hi>particularly,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>St. Matthews</hi> Goſpel be the undoubted word of God? <hi>Numb.</hi> 42.46. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether it be clear in your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that Chriſt did not inſtitute the Sacrament of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme unction? ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 58. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Whether alſo it be clear that Chriſt doth not give us his true body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? <hi>Numb.</hi> 59. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I ſhew divers points neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, for which you cannot ſhew evident Scripture. As, <hi>That God the Father is not begotten, God the Sonne is begotten and not made:</hi> And that <hi>he is Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial to his Father; That God the Holy Ghoſt is neither made nor begotten, but doth proceed, and that both from the Father and from the Son:</hi> ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 60. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> I preſſe for an evident Text for Baptizing Infants, or bringing them to be baptized when Parents can, which you hold neceſſary for all Parents. <hi>Numb.</hi> 61. I might have added that great Queſtion, <hi>Whether it be neceſſarie to rebaptize thoſe who be baptized by Hereticks.</hi> For as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith <hi>De Unitate Eccle. c.</hi> 22. <hi>This is neither openly nor evidently read</hi> (in Scripture) <hi>Neither by you nor by me. Yet if there were any wiſe man, of whom our Saviour had given teſtimony, and that he ſhould be conſulted in this Queſtion, we ſhould make no doubt</hi> (Mark this thou impugner of the infallibilitie of the Church) <hi>We ſhould make no doubt to perform what he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40740:150"/> ſhould ſay; Leſt we ſhould ſeem, not ſo much to gain ſay him, as to gainſay Chriſt, by whoſe teſtimony he was recommended? Now Chriſt beareth witneſs to his Church</hi> And a little after: <hi>Whoſoever refuſeth to follow the practice of the Church doth reſiſt our Saviour himſelf, who by his teſtimony commands the Church.</hi> I alledge theſe words for their convincing reaſon, and not for the authority of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> with whom you are ſo little ſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="17">17.<note place="margin">Of my 6. Number.</note> But now I muſt ſatisfie ſuch queſtions as you are ſtill interpoſing againſt, what I ſaid; I ſaid then, that, being Scriptures ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſhew'd for the deciſion of all neceſſary Controverſies, we muſt ſee further what Judge God hath appointed us to follow in the deciſion of them, &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with an Obligation to ſubmit to him; becauſe <hi>we gainſaying him, ſhould ſeem not ſo much to gainſay him as to gainſay Chriſt by whom this Judge was appointed to be heard by us,</hi> juſt as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſcourſed now. But this our Diſcourſe pleaſeth not you. You ſay, <hi>This ſpoyls all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts all.</hi> Becauſe you ſuppoſe that ſuch a Judge may contradict Scripture. Very likely! A Judge given by God, with a Commiſſion to direct all to ſalvation, and to that end aſſiſted <hi>by his Spirit never departing from his mouth, but abiding with him for ever, to teach him all truth,</hi> that he ſhould contradict the truth it ſelf. Is not this called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to ſay, that God can teſtifie of ſuch an one that he ſhall alwayes teach truth, the Spirit of truth never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from his mouth, and yet to ſay that he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Scriptures. Vain therefore is your fear that there ſhould be ſolid reaſons grounded in Scripture, againſt the doctrine of ſuch a Judge, who himſelf is <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> and whoſe tongue is directed by the ſame Spirit who directed the Pens of thoſe who writ the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="18">18. This Spirit of truth did not direct that pen which in your paper did write that foul calumny, which you utter in theſe words. <hi>We muſt then if he,</hi> (the Pope) <hi>ſaith Vices
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40740:151"/> are Vertues, ſay ſo too, as your</hi> Bellarmine <hi>determins in his fourth Book De Romano Pontifice C.</hi> 5. Good Sir, read this place again, and ſee if you can hold bluſhing. If I ſhould diſcourſe thus with a child, and ſay, know (dear child) that in no poſſible caſe it is lawful to call Vice Vertue. And this child ſhould childiſhly ſay, Sir, How if God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould ſay, ſuch a thing is a Vertue, and Chriſt ſhould preach that ſuch a thing were a Vice, were not I bound in this caſe to ſay that ſuch a Vertue is a Vice. Dear child would I ſay, this cannot happen. But if the child ſhould ſtill more childiſhly preſs me, Sir. But what if this ſhould happen? then I muſt ſay ſo, muſt I not? Yes (child) when, that ſhall grow to be poſſible, which is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, <hi>Then ſay, Vices are Vertues.</hi> Would not this child be the verieſt child that ever eſcaped the name of a fool, if he ſhould ſay, that I taught a caſe to be poſſible in which <hi>Vices might be called Vertues. Bellarmin</hi> ſaith in plain words <hi>It is impoſsible the Pope ſhould erre</hi> (eſpecially with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) <hi>commanding any Vice.</hi> And when he had proved this by other arguments he addeth alſo this proof, <hi>That</hi> (if he could command any Vice) <hi>he then ſhould neceſſarily erre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith</hi> (which before he had proved he could not do) <hi>ſeeing that Faith teacheth all Vertue to be good, all Vice to be bad.</hi> Then to thoſe, who will childiſhly know, what the people muſt do when the Pope, who (with a Council at leaſt) cannot erre againſt faith, ſhould erre againſt Faith, he anſwereth, that when this impoſſible thing happeneth, the Church ſhould be bound to believe Vices to be good, and Vertues evil, unleſſe ſhe would ſin againſt her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Even ſo Sir, when Chriſt or Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſhall be found teaching that to be Vice, which God, had before in the old Scripture revealed to be Vertue, you ſhall be bound to hold it a Vertue, becauſe God hath revealed it in the old Scripture; and alſo that it is Vice, becauſe, Chriſt (truth it ſelf) taught it ſo in the New Teſtament. But you ſhall not be bound to this, untill that happen which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40740:151"/> cannot happen. And ſo ſaid <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of the other Caſe; God forgive theſe wilful or exceeding careleſſe ſlanders.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Let us at laſt go on to ſee who muſt be our Judge in all Controverſies, All Proteſtants do ſay, (as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that the Scripture, and only the Scripture, is left us by Chriſt our Judge to end all Controverſies. And in this their Tenet they agree with all Hereticks who have riſen up againſt the Church of Chriſt. Here you fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as if I ſpoke againſt the uſe of Scripture in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. But Sir it is one thing to uſe Scripture for the proof of ſome points, and another thing to ſay Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and only Scripture muſt be the Judge for all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. To what end then is all you ſay againſt me as againſt one miſliking the uſe of Scripture? The force of my argument in effect is this. All Offenders againſt the Law will never be ſo much their own condemners, as to chooſe, on their own accord, a Judge by whom they know they ſhall clearly be condemned. Therefore when we ſee all Offendors againſt Gods Law in point of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, chooſe on their own accord, to be judged by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a manifeſt ſign that they know, they ſhall never be condemned clearly by Scripture, whom they took, for their Judge, becauſe (before they broached their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors) they knew all that this Judge would ſay againſt them. And they knew alſo by what gloſſes and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they could eſcape the being clearly condemned, by any thing which their Judge could ſay, Is not this true? And is it not alſo true, that you give ſo ample ſcope to theſe kind of gloſſes and interpretations, that, if you in particular be perſwaded that whole General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, one after another, have interpreted ſuch Texts in a falſe ſenſe, you may firmly believe your own particular interpretation. I think it would poſe you, to find any Hereticks living before theſe dayes, who were ſo preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious as to uphold any opinion which they held condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40740:152"/> before in a lawful general Councel. No Catholick I am ſure did ever do it.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Now, by reaſon our Adverſaries are ſtill detracting from us, as if we detracted from Scripture, becauſe we hold that God did not intend by it alone (otherwiſe then by ſending us to the Church) to decide all Controverſies, I did ſhew that we onely did truly believe Scripture. For he onely truly believeth a thing with Divine faith, who groundeth his aſſent upon Divine Revelation. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries doe not doe this. We onely doe it. I will ſhew both theſe things to be true, though I be forced to be ſomewhat large, for I can no where more profitably enlarge my ſelf then in theſe things which touch the ground of Faith, about which our main Controverſie is. I ſay then that our Adverſaries do not by Divine Faith believe the Scriptures to be Gods Word. For no body can believe this, with Divine Faith, who doth not ground his aſſent to this truth upon Divine Revelation. But our adverſaries do not ground their aſſent to this truth upon Divine Revelation, for they can ſhew no where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation upon which they believe ſuch and ſuch Books to be Gods Word. Shew me for example where God hath revealed that St. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel is the Word of God; ſhew me alſo the Revelation for which you believe other Books. What ſay you to this? You ſay <hi>That the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Books are worthy to be believed</hi> (and ſo is the Book of <hi>Toby</hi> and <hi>Judith</hi> as well as theſe) <hi>for themſelves, as we aſſent unto prime Principles in the habit of Intelligence by their own Light ſo we doe aſſent to Scripture to be the Word of God through the help of the Spirit of God as by its own Light.</hi> And again, afterwards, <hi>The Canonical Bookes</hi> (why not <hi>Toby</hi> and <hi>Judith,) bear witneſſes of themſelves. They carry their own light which we may ſee them by, as we ſee the Sun by its own light.</hi> Good Sir, Have you brought all the infallibility of chriſtian Religion unto this laſt ground, and here left it on the ground to be trampled by <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:40740:152"/> Do you exſpect that rational men ſhould believe you when you ſay in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that, as the firſt Principals are ſo evident of themſelves, that they need no proof, for example, <hi>That the whole is greater then any part of the whole, that if this be equal to that, it is equal to whatſoever is equal to that;</hi> ſo it is a thing, of it ſelf evident, that ſuch a book; (for example, Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel) is the true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Word, and that this is ſo clear that it needs no other proof, but the reading of it to make it manifeſtly infallible; even as the Sun needs no other evidence then his own light to be manifeſtly known. All that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, you ground upon the Scripture, as upon the true Word of God; and when you are further preſſed to know upon what ground you believe the books of Scripture to be the infallible Word of God, you confeſs in plain tearms, that the only infallible ground of this is, <hi>that this is evident of its own ſelf,</hi> needing no further proof for the requiring an infallible aſſent unto it. Indeed you have brought your whole Religion to as pitiful a caſe as your Adverſaries could wiſh it.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Firſt, this ground is accounted a plain fooliſh ground by your renowned <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> whoſe book the moſt learned of both Univerſities have owned and magnified, notwithſtanding his ſcornful Language of this ground of your whole Religion. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> then (P. 69. N. 49.) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering theſe words of his Adverſary, <hi>That the Divinitie of a writing cannot be known by it ſelf alone, but by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal authoritie,</hi> Replieth thus. <hi>This you need not prove for no wiſe man denieth it.</hi> And <hi>Doctor Covel</hi> in his defence, Art. 4. P. 31. <hi>It is not the Word of God which doth or poſsible can aſſure us that we doe well to think it the Word of God.</hi> And Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> writeth thus. <hi>Of things neceſſary the very chief is to know what Books we are to eſteem Holy, which point is confeſſed impoſsible for the Scripture it ſelf to teach.</hi> So he Eccl. Pol. L. 1. S. 14. P. 86. That which this man whom ſome call, <hi>the moſt learned Proteſtant amongſt the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40740:153"/> Engliſh who put pen to paper,</hi> that which this man and Dr. <hi>Covet</hi> holdeth <hi>as an impoſsibility,</hi> and conſequently for a <hi>mere Chymera,</hi> you hold not onely poſſible, <hi>but evident,</hi> and not only evident <hi>but as evident as the Suns being ſeen by his own light,</hi> and not onely ſo evident, <hi>but evident with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient certaintie to ground on infallible aſſent,</hi> which is a far higher degree than the certainty we have of our ſeeing the Sun by his Light, which depends upon our fallible ſenſe; but this muſt be an infallible ground, or elſe your faith of this cannot be infallible. Yea, your own ſelf, when you leaſt thought of it (when in another place I urged the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Church to judge all Controverſies) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a greater neceſſity of ſuch a Church to declare, by infallible authority, which Books be the true Word of God, which not; then to declare any other point; where as, if it had been true, that this point might as well be ſeen infallibly, by the onely reading of ſuch Books, as the Sun is ſeen by his light, there ſhould have been leſs neceſſity of ſuch an infallible Declaration; for of all unneceſſary things no thing would be more unneceſſary then another light, by which we might ſee the Sun more clearly.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Secondly, there be many millions, who cannot tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely proteſt before God, and take it upon their ſalvations, that they are wholy unable, by the reading theſe books, to come to an infallible aſſurance that theſe be Gods Word, or to any ſuch aſſurance as cometh near infallibility. Now Sir, I pray tell me, what means hath God provided to bring theſe men to this infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which they are obliged under pain of damnation to have? For he ſhall be damned who doth not infallibly believe the Scripture; If you tell me it is impoſſible that after fervent prayer to God they ſhould ſtill have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible knowledge, aſſuring them ſuch and ſuch books are Gods Word, I muſt needs tell you it is impoſſible for me, and (as I thinke) for any wiſe man to believe you.</p>
            <p n="23">
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:40740:153"/>23. Thirdly, if your opinion of knowing true Scripture, by the reading of them, were true, then let but a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Turk, or Jew, read the Goſpel, he muſt, by reading of it, ſee it as clearly to be Gods Word, as he muſt ſee the Sun by his light. And again, becauſe all things neceſſary to ſalvation be plainly ſet down in the Word of God (as you teach) the ſame Heathen ſhould plainly ſee all things neceſſary to ſalvation warranted him by the undoubted Word of God. If this were true, it is impoſsible that thouſands ſhould not be yearly converted by this means. How cometh it then to paſs that the reading of Scriptures alone, did never find that concurrence of Gods grace to convert any ſingle man (that we could hear of) whereas the Preachers of the Church of God have found this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Gods grace to the converſion of millions.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Fourthly, nothing being to be believed (as you teach) but Scripture, it followeth that the faith (by which we believe Scripture to be Gods Word) muſt be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt ground of all faith upon which all is built, and the greateſt light of Chriſtian Veritie; how incredible a thing then is it, that this ſhould be true, and that the prime Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of the Church, in none of their ſo many writings concerning our faith, ſhould never mention this? and that no ſmall glimpſe of this light ſhould be obſervable in the writings of all Antiquitie? In which the moſt obſerving eyes cannot eſpy the leaſt glimpſe of it. Reply, I think if the Doctours of the Primitive Church had told the Heathens that they had no better aſſurance for all the points of their (then new) faith then the Word of God written, and no greater aſſurance that ſuch and ſuch writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were his undoubted Word, then the very reading of thoſe books did give them, by a light as evident as the Sun, the Heathens would have ſcoffed at them for ſaying that which they proteſted to be ſo viſible, and yet none could ſee it but thoſe who firſt believe it upon this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to them wholly inviſible.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:40740:154"/>25. Fifthly, I argue thus. Take a book, which you hold not to be Gods undoubted word; The book of <hi>Toby</hi> (for example) or <hi>Judith,</hi> and read theſe books over. And then take another book, which you hold to be Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Word, for example, the book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> and read that over, or rather to end the ſooner (read over only as many Chapters as be in the book of <hi>Toby,</hi> that is 16. and then I challenge you to tell me if you can (as ſurely you can if it be as cleare (as Sun ſhine) in what Chapter, Verſe, or Word, any divine rayes (and ſuch rayes as are ſufficiently obſervable to produce an infallible aſſent, that ſuch a book is Gods undoubted word) which rayes be not to the very full as obſervable in the ſame chapter and verſe or equivolent word, of the book of <hi>Toby:</hi> What would you have us doe with our eyes to keep us from ſeing how clearly this is impoſſible for you to doe, which notwithſtanding ſhould be moſt eaſie, if your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were true or the truth.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Sixthly, if any one verſe yea or any one ſmall word, (eſpecially this litle word <hi>Not</hi> be left out in any Chapter either through ignorance, malice or careleſnes of thoſe writers, whoſe Copies our printed books have followed, whom will you be able to make believe that you are ſo ſharp-ſighted, as to ſee this omſſion by a light, ſufficient for an infallible beliefe of it onely by the reading theſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Seventhly, To prove that true general Councels be fallible you uſe often to alledge this argument, that one true generall Councell directly gainſaith another, which if you could prove) you ſhould indeed prove that the Councils are fallible. But I can prove unto you that one who readeth the ſame book as well as you, and hath the true Spirit of God as well as you (if not in a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) ſhall flatly ſay that Book not to be Gods Word, which you without all doubt affirm to be Gods infallible Word. This ground then of knowing which is, which
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40740:154"/> is not Gods Word, grounding contradictory opinions muſt needs be falſe, as I prove thus, <hi>Luther</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by your common conſent to have had Gods Spirit, did read over the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>James,</hi> and held it to be <hi>an Epiſtle of ſtraw.</hi> He did read over the Book of the <hi>Apocalips</hi> or <hi>Revelations</hi> and held it <hi>not to have been written by an Apoſtolical Spirit.</hi> You read over theſe books, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſo ſeriouſly, that by the light of them you infalliblely know them, to be Gods true Word. Your two opinions are flat contradictory, and yet they are both grounded upon this ground of reading theſe books with the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore this ground is fallible, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ground an infallible faith of this point. But you have no other infallible faith of this point, but what is grounded on this fallible ground, <hi>Ergo</hi> the faith you have of this point is not an infallible, and divine faith, but a meer humane perſwaſion, ſuch as we have to believe the works, <hi>Virgils</hi> to have been written by <hi>Virgil.</hi> But if any deſire to have this caſe put in two Men, whom moſt of the world will more aſſuredly believe to have had the true Spirit of God, and to have had alſo as cleere-ſighted eyes, as moſt men we know in all mankind, I will put the caſe in the two prime Doctours of the Latine Church, Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> read over the bookes of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and could not by the reading of them ſee them infallibly to be Gods Word. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> read theſe books, and held them infallibly to be Gods Word. How came theſe two moſt ſharp-ſighted men to ſee quite contrary to one another by the ſelf ſame moſt clear Light, as you muſt ſay. But we deny that either of them did ſee this Light, and that by it onely they did ſee which were true, which falſe Scriptures. But we ſay they both followed in this point the propoſition of the Church, which Church in Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> time had not clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the book of <hi>Machabees</hi> to be Gods word. But the third Council of <hi>Garthage</hi> (at which <hi>Auſtin</hi> was preſent)
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40740:155"/> declared theſe Books to be Gods Word, and ſo Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> held th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Books infallibly to be Gods Word, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this his belief upon the Declaration of the Council at <hi>Carthage,</hi> which Council ſaith (<hi>Canon</hi> 47.) that it did ſet down theſe books for Scripture, <hi>becauſe we have received from our Fathers that thoſe are to be read in the Church.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> had not ſeen this Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was uſed to ground his faith, by which he believed ſuch books to be, or not be Gods Word upon the Declaration of the Church, therefore until he did ſee that Declaration, he could not hold this as infallible, which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> afterwards held infallible becauſe he had ſeen afterwards that Declaration of the Church. This is an excellent proof of our Opinions, and diſproof of yours, which cannot give any kind of reaſon for their diſagreeing in a thing ſo clear as you ſay this point is.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Hence you will ſee that this Evidence upon which you ground your infallible aſſent to believe Scripture, to be Gods Word (and then all the reſt for Gods Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſo ungroundedly) is not improperly by you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that Evidence, by which the firſt Principles, ſhew themſelves to be evidently true, as this Principle doth, <hi>It is impoſsible that any thing ſhould be ſo, and yet not be ſo in all the ſelfſame circumſtances.</hi> For who ever did differ about ſuch a Principle as this is. All men ſee the Evidence of theſe Principles. But none but a few of your ſect, ſee the Evidence of what you ſay. Yea they evidently ſee there is no ſuch evidence to be ſeen. And if you ſay that we muſt have a ſpecial ſpirit (that is, new eyes) to ſee it, Then you, who have this ſpirit, are all Prophets diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by private Revelations made to your ſelves, that which all mankind beſides could not and cannot diſcover. But now, when I ſee all, and every one of your belief, laying claime to the Sprit, aſſiſting them even as farre as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the hardeſt of all points, I hope no prudent man will thinke that Gods Church may not lay claim
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40740:155"/> (with a thouſand times far greater reaſon) to the Spirit of the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſting her even to infallibility in points of as much conſequence, the Church having far more proof of his aſſiſtance, then every private Proteſtant. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe our Divines often call the Scripture, <hi>An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Principle, the firſt Principle;</hi> you think they hold this Principle like the firſt Principle in Sciences, which are therefore indemonſtrable, becauſe they are of themſelves as evident, as any reaſon you can bring to make them more evident. But the Scripture is onely ſaid to be an unqueſtionable Principle, becauſe it is already granted to be Gods Word by all parties. But why all grant it, all muſt give the reaſon, for the Scripture of it ſelf cannot ſhew it ſelf to be infallibly Gods Word as I have proved.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Eighthly and laſtly, if you intend for the ſolution of any of the former Arguments (though you cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape moſt of them by that ſhift) to fly to the private aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſpirit, helping you to ſee that, which this light of the Scriptures alone cannot help them unto, then you muſt come infallibly to know you have this help from the ſpirit of truth: for it you know this onely fallibly, that will not help you to an infallible aſſent. Now how can you know this infallibility but by a Revelation ſecure from all illuſion? Tell me how you came by this Revelation? Did <hi>you trie the Spirit whether it were of God or no?</hi> If no, how are you then ſecured? If you did, by what infallible means did you trie it? If you can by Scripture, we muſt needs laugh, becauſe we ſpeak of the firſt act of belief by which you, or any other firſt began to believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be infallibly Gods Word. Before you believed the Scripture to be Gods infallible Word you could not by it (as by a means infallible to your judgement) trie your ſpirit, and know it to be infallibly the Spirit of truth. Again, you could not know it to be the Spirit of ruth, until you had firſt an infallible aſſurance that the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40740:156"/> Scripture (by which you did try it) was infallibly Gods true word. And yet again you could not have an infallible aſſurance that ſuch books of Scripture were Gods infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible word, but by this infallible aſſurance you had, that this Spirit helping you to ſee this, was the Spirit of Truth: ſo that you could not be infallibly aſſured of your Spirit until you had infallible aſſurance that the Scripture was Gods Word; and you could not have infallible aſſurance that the Scripture was Gods Word untill you were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly aſſured of your Spirit; Is not this clearly to walk in a Circle with the wicked?</p>
            <p n="30">30. Having now ſhewed that you (who reject the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church) have left your ſelves no infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground, upon which you can believe that moſt Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article of belief, to wit, that ſuch and ſuch Books be infallibly Gods true Word; I am preſſed to ſhew what infallible belief we have of this point, and how we avoid all Circle. I Anſwer that we ground the beliefe of this point upon the authority of the Church, <hi>as being Infallible</hi> in propoſing the Verities ſhe hath received from God. This infallibility I do not ſuppoſe, but prove at large, Chapter 4. If you have not patience to ſtay, turn now to that place. You falſly ſay that <hi>Whatſoever authority the Church hath towards this perſwaſion you alſo make uſe of as a motive to this faith.</hi> She hath an infallible authority, which you count a fancy, and make no other uſe of it, but to ſcoff at it; and yet this infallibility alone muſt be that which groundeth, not this perſwaſion, but this infallible aſſent. Take the Church as a moſt grave aſſembly of pious learned men, without any infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, and their authority is but humane, and ſo all the help you can have from them will not ground an infallible aſſent, which we muſt have in our belief, to hold Scripture infallible to be Gods Word. The Scriptures (as I have ſhewed) have no where revealed which bookes be Scripture, which not; and ſo we have
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40740:156"/> no other infallible ground left us but the authority of this Church, as aſsiſted infalliblie by the Holy Ghoſt. Some thing even in this place, I ſhall adde of this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lability ſo to ſatisfy your preſent longing.</p>
            <p n="31">31. But for the preſent you are endeavoring to include me in a Circle as I did you in the laſt objection <hi>why</hi> (ſay you) <hi>do I believe the Scripture to be Gods word. Becauſe the Church ſaith it. Very Well. Why do I believe the Church? Becauſe the Scripture beareth witnes of it.</hi> No Sir. You never heard me give this reaſon unleſſe it were when I ſpoke to one, who independently of the Church, did profeſſe him ſelfe to believe the Scripture ſo be Gods Word, as you do, who profeſſe to believe this upon an infallible aſſurance received (as you ſay) from Gods Word by the very reading of it. Againſt thoſe who upon another account (different from the infallible authority of the Church, receive Gods Word!) I prove, that according to that word of God, the Church is to be heard and believed, as the piller and ground of truth. And for this point I produce as clear Texts as you do for moſt of thoſe points which you hold neceſſary for Salvation. But if you be a Scholler you know that all our Divines in their Treatiſes of faith, put this very queſtion which you here put <hi>Why do you believe the church?</hi> and not one of them anſwereth as you here make us anſwer; that ſo you might the better impugn us with the applauſe of the deceived multitude. Sir, when we deal with thoſe who have not admitted the Scriptures as infallible, we do not prove them to be ſo by the Authority of the Church, without firſt proving to them this Authority of the Church (and that independently of Scripture) to be infallible. Now if you aske me how I doe this? then indeed you ſpeak to the purpoſe, though not to your purpoſe which was to ſhut me up in a Circle into which you ſee, I never ſet foot.</p>
            <p n="32">
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:40740:157"/>32. Now, if you will ſtill be earneſt to know why I do believe this Church to be infallible; I anſwer, that to give full ſatisfaction againſt all that a caviller can ſay, requireth a Treatiſe longer then this whole Treatiſe. What I have ſaid is ſufficient to avoid all Circle, when withal I ſhall have told you that we proceed as ſecurely and grounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the reaſons for which we believe, the Church to have received from God, Commiſſion to teach us thoſe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Verities, which ſhe hath received from God, with infallible certainty, as many millions have proceeded in their imbracing the true Faith, whoſe proceedings no man can condemn. I pray, why did the Jewes believe their Prophets to have had Commiſſion from God to deliver his Word infallibly to them by word of mouth, and by writing? Surely as they moſt prudently believed what the Prophets taught them by word of mouth to be infallibly true, becauſe ſpoken by thoſe, whom God gave Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay what they ſaid; ſo they moſt prudently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what the ſame men did deliver to them by their writings as Gods Word, becauſe written by thoſe, whom God gave Commiſsion unto to write what they writ. The credit and belief given as well to their writings, as to their words unwritten, was at laſt found prudently accepted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Motives, upon which they accepted their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as given by God for their infallible inſtruction. All were moved prudently to accept of this their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe God did own it for his by ſeveral Miracles, or other moſt apparent proofs, teſtifying to the people the infallible Commiſsion which thoſe Prophets, and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture writers had, to teach them by words, or writing, or both. Their wits then were induced to accept of this their Commiſsion as truly given by God, moved thereunto by ſuch prudent Motives, that it had been a high act of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence (which in point of ſalvation is damnable) to have disbelieved them; for example, they did either ſee ſuch apparent Miracles, or ſuch notorious force of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40740:157"/> working viſibly ſo ſtrange changes of manners, and in ſo many before ſo vitious, to a life very Vertuous, and ſometimes vertuous in a ſtupidious degree. The writers of the New Teſtament had theſe divine attentions yet more abundantly (though the others cannot be denied ſufficient) whence as from their only words not yet writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many thouſands received their faith, becauſe they firſt prudently were induced by theſe Motives to acknowledge them to have had a true Commiſsion from God, to ſay to us in his Name all that they ſaid, and then becauſe they acknowledged this Commiſsion to be from God, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved infallibly all what they ſaid, becauſe they ſaid it with Commiſsion from God to ſay it. So by their words now written by them in the Scriptures, which they delivered unto them, many thouſands received their Faith, becauſe firſt prudently they were induced by theſe Motives to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge theſe writers to have had a true Commiſsion from God to write what they did write in his Name, and then becauſe they acknowledged this Commiſsion to have been from God they did believe infallibly all that they did write, becauſe they did write it with Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God. Thus you ſee upon what aſſurance, thoſe who firſt received the Scriptures did receive them for Gods VVord. The Apoſtles gave their writings to the prime Prelates and Paſtors of the Church, aſſuring them in Gods Name that theſe writings were Gods VVord. Theſe Paſtors and Prelates preached to the people that they ſhould admit of theſe writings as Gods true VVord. VVhat they preached was believed with an infallible aſſent upon the authoritie of the prime Paſtours of the Church. They were prudently induced to give an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſent to their authority by theſe ſtrong Motives by which they had demonſtrated themſelves to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion from God to teach his Doctrine, both by word and writing. Thus was the firſt Age aſſured of Gods Word by the Oral Tradition of the firſt Paſtors of the Church,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40740:158"/> aſſuring them alſo <hi>that the Spirit of truth would abide with the Church, teaching her all truth,</hi> and that <hi>they were to hear the Church under pain of being accounted Publicans and Heathens</hi> and that ſhe ſhould be unto them <hi>as the piller and ground of truth:</hi> for as they did write, ſo doubtleſs they did teach theſe things. Theſe firſt Chriſtians then received this doctrine with an aſſent as infallible as they received the Scriptures. And ſo all then believed and all taught their Succeſſors to believe the Church to have ſuch infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, that in all doubts ariſing about faith they were to ſubmit unto her, as to one having Commiſsion from God to declare all ſuch matters. The ſecond Age by ſo univerſal, ſo full, ſo manifeſt a tradition, was moſt prudently induced to acknowledge the church to have ſuch a Commiſſion from God, and ſo they believe the Church for this divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given her. Now there is nothing which can make any thing more prudently credible then univerſal traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; A miracle to confirm that there is ſuch a City as <hi>London,</hi> though in it ſelf it were a ſurer motive, would not work ſo undoubted a beliefe in the minds of thoſe who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſee <hi>London,</hi> as univerſal tradition worketh. And yet this tradition is but one of the motives which induceth us to acknowledge the Church to have received Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to declare with infallible authority the Verities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Apoſtles, and conſequently her declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be admitted with infallible aſſent for her authority. But I muſt needs note that this motive of tradition alone, did ſerve to make all for the firſt 2000 yeares and more, give an infallible aſſent to their Church ſee Ch. 4. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 11. yet here I intreat you to mark how they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their faith then. Why did they believe then that the Soul was immortal. Becauſe God ſaid ſo by his Church. having Commiſſion to teach us all we are to believe. Why believed they that this Church had Commiſſion to teach them as Authorized with due infallibilitie? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40740:158"/> the ſame Church told them ſo. Why did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this? Becauſe they would do ſo, And they would do ſo becauſe, it had been meere folly not to accept of this Churches Commiſſion to teach them infallibly all truths, which Commiſsion they knew by tradition to have been ever accepted as divine by all good people; ſo we &amp;c. I will adde one Motive more.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Miracles are called <hi>a Teſtimony greater then Iohn the Baptiſt.</hi> Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <hi>If you will not believe me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my Works?</hi> By this great teſtimony of Miracles God hath often owned the doctrine of the Romane Church, even as it is in this our dayes. For he knoweth but litle of the world, who doth not know the vaſt extent of thoſe Provinces and Kingdomes which in this laſt Age the Preachers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith have added to their Faith by this Teſtimony of God, <hi>by Signes and Wonders, and divers Miracles,</hi> Hebrewes 2.4. And here moſt Viſibly, <hi>Our Lord ever working withall, and confirming their words by Signes and Miracles.</hi> It appeareth alſo by the Hiſtory of <hi>Bede</hi> and the plain confeſſion of your learned <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> that the faith brought into our <hi>England</hi> by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> was the ſame faith which you aboliſhed by your Reformation, as you call it. And yet again it appeareth by <hi>Bede</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> his Epiſtles, that wonderful were the miracles which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrought in Confirmation of the faith preached, in ſo much that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to admoniſh him of conteining himſelf in humility, leſt the working of ſo many miracles ſhould puff him up. Theſe Preachers preached the Doctrine of our Church. God confirmed their Doctrine by miracles. Therefore the doctrine of our Church was confirmed by miracles. And it may for this motive be imbrac'd with as infallible an aſſent as the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſt. Yea, there have bin many miracles wrought to teſtifie many &amp; very many of thoſe points in particular in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. As you may ſee ſhew'd by <hi>Brierly</hi> only by looking in his <hi>Index.</hi> 5. <hi>miracles,</hi> but ſee him particularly, <hi>T.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 3 <hi>Tr. S.</hi> 7. <hi>Subdivis,</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:40740:159"/> And <hi>Tr.</hi> 1. <hi>S.</hi> 5. There you ſhall ſee how ſolidly grounded theſe Miracles are, againſt which you can object nothing which is not objected with equal probabilitie by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens againſt the Miracles of the Prophets, and by Jewes againſt thoſe of the Apoſtles. Tell me then if theſe two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives (though there be yet many others) be not as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inducements to move us to acknowledge that God hath given his Church infallible authoritie to teach us faithfully which ſhe received from him, as were thoſe motives for which the Jewes did prudently believe that the Scripture given them by <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>Salomon,</hi> by <hi>Nahum,</hi> by <hi>Amos</hi> and others, were written with infallible authoritie by them, having Commiſſion from God to write what they did write. We then believe the Church to have ſuch a Commiſſion with as good ſecurity as they acknowledged this Commiſſion in thoſe Scripture writers. Whereas the ground upon which you believe Scripture is thought to be fooliſh and Chimerical by ſome of your beſt Writers.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Yet to ſhew further how unſecurely the greater part of your Religion did ground their faith, I did add this argument that the true Original Scriptures were written in languages not knowne to one among ten thouſand, if we ſpeake of a perfect knowledge. Others muſt truſt the Tranſlations of private men, and believe them rather then the Tranſlations uſed by the Church in general Councils Is it not cleere that the Authority of ſuch Tranſlations is far greater, and far more to be judged to agree with the true Original, then any of your private Mens Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? You your ſelfe confeſſe that Tranſlations are only ſo far Gods word as they agree with the originals, whence I infer that no body in your opinion can believe any point upon the authority of any Tranſlations, until he be aſſured that ſuch a point agreeth with the true Hebrew or true Greek Original; How diſappointed then be moſt of your Religion, eſpecially your women, who ſo fiercely fly upon us for believing the Church, whileſt they themſelves
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40740:159"/> muſt either believe nothing (for they cannot believe any thing upon the credit of the Engliſh Tranſlation, until they know how exactly it agreeth with the true Greek, or true Hebrew Original, which is wholy impoſſible for them) or elſe they muſt merely take upon truſt the moſt fallible Tranſlations for the infallible Original, and truſt rather in this moſt important point the learning, and fair dealing of thoſe private Miniſters (deeply intereſſed in this cauſe) then truſt the grateſt authority upon earth, which is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council having ſo ſtrong promiſe of the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. I intreat you here to ſee Chapter 4. Numb. 9.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Again, I pray tell me how you learned Miniſters who have ſo full knowledge of theſe languages as to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, and upon your own knowledge to judge of true Tranſlations made by others, of you it is that I ask how you come to know (and know ſo ſufficiently as to ground an infallible aſſent in your ſelves and others) when your Tranſlations agree with the true Original? For you have now confeſſed <hi>that Tranſlations are only ſo far Gods word as they agree with the Originals.</hi> And you muſt mean the true Originals or elſe you ſay nothing, for agreeing with falſe or doubtful Originals will not make them Gods undoubted Word. Tell me, (I ſay it again, and again) how do you know which be the true, and undoubtedly true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals? and upon what ſecure ground do you know it? The true Originals be either Hebrew or Greek; As for the Hebrew, all muſt know that the ancient Hebrew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were all written without points, that is, in full ſubſtance without Vowels. Now they be the Vowels which make or marre the word and ſenſe; for a Vowell addeth the ſoul and the ſound to the conſonants, and maketh them ſignify moſt different things. For example, for <hi>a Ball</hi> write only <hi>b ll</hi> to which conſonants if you adde an <hi>(a)</hi> it is <hi>Ball,</hi> adde an <hi>(e)</hi> it is <hi>Bell,</hi> adde an <hi>(u)</hi> and it is a <hi>Bull,</hi> So that, great confuſion muſt needs follow if the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40740:160"/> true points, that is the true Vowells were not put to the ſame Conſonants. Well now again, all muſt know that a good while after the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Jewiſh Rabbies, under pretence of avoyding the miſtakes which might happen in the leſſe skilfull in the Hebrew tongue (which then was almoſt worn out) did take the old Hebrew Teſtament, and put the points, that is the Vowels unto it, ſo that the old Teſtament we now uſe came from theſe Jewiſh hands. Tell me then how know you infallibly whither theſe perfidious Jewes had skill, and honeſty enough to deliver to us their Copies with the true points and Vowells; and yet all depends on this. The conſonants alone will not aſſure us in theſe unskilful, and ſo remote ages. For the leaſt change in appoint mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt contrary things to be all one, for no Man can tell (eſpecially infallibly) whether theſe words <hi>an Angel had a b ll in his hand</hi> ſhould <hi>be</hi> read thus, <hi>an Angel had a Ball, in his hand or a Bell, or a Bill, or a Bull.</hi> Put a falſe Vowel and it is all one. <hi>To taſt cheeſe and to toſt cheeſe,</hi> all one; <hi>to be fatt and to be fitt, to increaſe in Grace</hi> and <hi>to increaſe in Grece,</hi> all one; to eat <hi>a bitter fig and to eat a better fig. A pot ful of butter,</hi> and <hi>a Pit ful of Batter,</hi> will be the ſame. Hence you ſee the ſmall infallibility you have of the poſſeſsing the true undoubted Originall Hebrew old Teſtament. As for the new teſtament. Saint <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſpel was Originally written in Hebrew, and that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is quite loſt. Now the other Greek Originalls which we have, have a ſtupendious Variety, He who found the word Infallible ſo unfortunate to him (which you obiect to me) telleth of his own knowledge a ſtory moſt unfortunate to you and yours (which I have alſo h eapd by an other way,) His words are theſe. <hi>In my hearing Biſhop</hi> Uſher, <hi>profeſſed, that whereas he had of many yeares before a deſire to publiſh the Teſtament in Greek with Various Lections and Annotations, and for that purpoſe had uſed great diligence and ſpent much money to furniſh himſelf
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40740:160"/> with Manuſcripts, yet in concluſion he was forced to deſiſt utterly leaſt, if he ſhould ingenuouſly have noted all the ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of readings which himſelf had collected, the incredible multitude of them almoſt in every verſe, ſhould rather have made Men Atheiſticall then ſatisfy them in the true reading of any particular paſſage. An evident ſigne that the Governours of the Church did not onely rely upon what was in writing.</hi> So Creſſy Exomol. C. 8. N. 3. Now if another in <hi>Spain,</hi> another at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or other in ſome remote part from theſe had beſtowed the like or greater expences, and induſtries in procuring Varieties of Manuſcripts, it is moſt probable they might have in theſe places found in every one of them, as great variety of lections, which multitude of Lections <hi>Uſher</hi> alone found to <hi>be incredible almoſt in every verſ.</hi> The Manuſcripts which were before all printing being ſo exceeding different, what aſſurance have thoſe who did firſt print ſuch, or ſuch a Manuſcript, rather then a hundred Manuſcripts (different from that which they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that the Manuſcript, which was the true undoubted Copy of the true undoubted Originall was printed by them, and publiſhed to the world, which now contents it ſelf with printed Copies onely, and not one among twenty thouſand hath recourſe to any old written Manuſcripts; or if they have recourſe to any ſuch Manuſcript, or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, yet they are ſo wonderfull farre from having any full aſſurance, that ſuch Manuſcripts be the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Copies, of the true undoubted Original; that they approach not one inch nearer the Aſſurance of the Truth, by having Recourſe to ſuch Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts. And here it is that I may farre fitter uſe theſe your owne words (uſed in another place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me;) <hi>Alas Sir, At what a loſſe are you and yours in this grand and capital and comprehenſive contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, which affords me liberty to think, that which is intricated with ſo many unſpeakable difficulties and moſt manifeſt uncertainties, is not that manifeſt ground of certainty,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40740:161"/> and infallible certainty, by which fools cannot erre; for what elſe can a Collier have infallibly to guide him through all theſe Labyrinths,</hi> whoſe windings are made more unextricable by lying ſo far from the leaſt glimpſe of any Light: For as you ſay <hi>Tranſlations are only ſo farre Gods Word as they agree with the Originals,</hi> that is with ſuch Originals as are the true and undoubted Copies of the true and undoubted Original. But (ſay I) it is impoſſible for any man living (who accounteth the judgment of the Church to be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to know infallibly, which Tranſlation agree with the true undoubted Originals, and which not, becauſe it is impoſſible for him to know which be the true undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Originals, and which not. Therefore it is impoſſible for any man living (who accounteth the judgement of the Church to be fallible) to know which Tranſlations be the word of God and which not. You then have neither infallible aſſurance of tranſlation, nor of Original, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently you have no aſſurance of any part of Scripture to be God aſſured Word. And yet all the aſſurance of your faith is built upon this, of which you have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at all. For you have no aſſurance of either <hi>Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Original</hi> or <hi>Interpretation</hi> of any one book or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or which books make up the whole Canon.</p>
            <p n="36">36. As for our aſſurance of the Word of God it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not upon theſe inextricable uncertainties. If thoſe who received the firſt true Original Coppy did upon good ground receive it, relying upon the authority of thoſe who did give it unto them, as an authority infallible; we up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no leſſe good ground receive (as authentical and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from error, both in faith and manners) our Vulgar Tranſlation, which we receive upon the infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, An infalliblity as well grounded as theirs who received firſt the true Original Scriptures, as I proved Numbers 32.33. But of this infallibility I am to treat at large Chapter 4. If <hi>Iſidor Clarins</hi> in any one title importing faith or manners, differs from what
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40740:161"/> we receive, upon this infallible authority, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with him; what you object againſt us for the different editions of <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> hath bin anſwered by many, and very fully by that famous book called <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie Maintained,</hi> written againſt <hi>Potter,</hi> ſee it Part. 2. Cap. 6. Numb. 3. Where, by authentical Teſtimonies of perſons beyond all exceptions, is ſhewed that the decree of <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> about his edition, was never promulgated, and that he himſelfe, had declared diverſe things to have crept in which needed a ſecond review, and that the whole work ſhould be re-examined though he could never do it, being prevented by death. The very ſelf ſame is told you diſtinctly in the Preface to our Vulgar Edition: but I cited the former book, becauſe of his ſeverall proofs, and becauſe <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (who with ſo much applauſe of many) anſwered this book, doth not return one word to diſprove his Adverſaries moſt ſatisfactory anſwer. All your other arguments end in the biting of a flea.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Next you object two places of S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> But Sir you have given me leave to have no more to do with the Fathers Authority. Councils you alſo labour to diſcredit in the higheſt degree, for you make them like falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, in matters concerning the ſalvation of infinite people, to betray their own falſity, in affirming things directly contradictory. You muſt not ſay, but prove by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and other good Authors, that two lawful Councils, lawfully approved, have taught contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in matter of Faith, otherwiſe you only deceive the people, which knoweth not which Councils were lawful, which not. Would you make us believe S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> a lawful Council? Do you your ſelf hold it ſo? Did not he know it was not ſo? as wel as you. After all then you cannot ſhew which is your prime Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. That, take away the infallibility of the Church, you can find infallible means by Scripture only to decide all Controverſies; for by Scripture only it is a plain impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40740:162"/> to decide which Scriptures be the true word of God, which not, As alſo which be corrupted which be not, and which be the true original Copies of the true Books, which be not, This is a true convincing argument.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Another argument is, that there be many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies (and may be yet many more) the deciſion of which is neceſſary to Salvation, and yet they cannot be decided by Scripture only, and conſequently ſome other infallible Judge (to wit the Church) is neceſſary for the infallible deciſion of theſe points. Your ſecond anſwer ſtill is, that the deciſions of all ſuch Controverſies are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in Scripture, which I have at large ſhewed in the beginning of this Chapter, to be falſe, and now I go to ſhew it further by ſpecifying divers of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in particular.</p>
            <p n="39">
               <note place="margin">Of my 8th. Number.</note>39. The firſt of theſe Controverſies is about the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of not working upon the Sunday. You dare not ſay that he ſhall be ſaved who doth weekly work, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth to work upon the Sunday, without any neceſſity. You muſt then affirm, that to abſtain from working upon that day, is a point neceſſary to Salvation. Now I ask where this neceſſary point is plainly ſet down in Scripture? And I preſſe you to give me, as clear Texts to prove this, as I cited at large to prove that we muſt not now work on Saturdayes. You are to ſhew Texts in which this point is plainly ſet down, for theſe Texts I called. In place of theſe Texts you bring your own diſcourſes. Now according to your own opinion that Councils, though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in their diſcourſes out of Scripture, may be forſaken by him who judgeth ſuch diſcourſes nothing ſo well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Text, as the diſcourſes for the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are grounded in other Texts. Hence you muſt needs give the Sabbatharians, leave to reject theſe your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with far greater reaſon then you reject the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Councils. Whence then ſhall we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible deciſion of this Controverſie. Your own Doctor

               <hi>Tayler</hi> in his defence of Epiſcopacy. Pag. 100. writeth thus, <hi>For that</hi> (keeping of the Sunday) <hi>in the New Teſtament we have no precept and nothing but the example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Diſciples. At</hi> Geneva <hi>they were once upon changing Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes Feaſt into Thurſday, to have ſhown their Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> If this were plainly ſet down in Scripture would not theſe your illuminated Brethren ſee it as well as you. And you ſo often called upon for a plain Text, inſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infallible Texts, bring nothing but a diſcourſe of your own, very fallible, and proving nothing but a poſſibility of ſuch a change, To the far ſtronger Text, for ſtill kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Sabboth, you ſay not a word. My argument then as yet hath nothing like a ſatisfactory anſwer returned unto it.</p>
            <p n="40">40.<note place="margin">Of my 9th. Number.</note> The ſecond Controverſie which I ſaid could not clearly be decided by Scripture is about our lawful eating or not eating of that which is ſtrangled, clearly forbidden <hi>Act.</hi> 15. But becauſe there may be ſome reaſons alledged why this precept now obligeth no longer (though I might inſiſt that we ſeek for Texts and not for reaſons) I preſſe this argument no further, having ſo great plenty of far more preſſing arguments.</p>
            <p n="41">41.<note place="margin">Of my 10th. Number.</note> A third Controverſie not clearly decided for you by Scripture, I briefly touched concerning the holding the King, Head of the Church, whom you according to plain Scripture. determine to be ſtill the Head of the Church, though others hold it very far from being plain Scripture. This Controverſie muſt needs highly import, that all the Members may have an aſſured knowledge of the Head, by whom they are to be governed. This point was before evident Scripture, now it is no longer evident Scripture. Your anſwer is firſt. <hi>What is infallibly decided by Scripture, will ever be ſo, although we do not always find it.</hi> Sir, if you mean what is infallibly decided by evident Scripture, is not alwayes to be found, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly falſe. This being againſt the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40740:163"/> of that which is evident when it is ſuppoſed to ſtand laid wide open before our eyes in the ſame words which made it before evident Scripture. You add, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>That you doe not ſay every point is Infallibly deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Scripture, becauſe it is not at all decided?</hi> Sir, Is not this a neceſſary point, and be not theſe your own words? <hi>All things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> and again, <hi>What is not plainly ſet down in Scripture is hereby underſtood not to be neceſſary.</hi> Grant theſe Principles falſe and the cauſe is mine. If they be true, this point being neceſſary, muſt alſo be plainly decided by clear Scripture. And when you aske me <hi>whether it be determined in Scripture that the Pope is head of the Church?</hi> You forget that we do not teach (as you do) that all points neceſſary are plainly ſet down in Scripture, but we teach the quite contrary. You that hold that on the one ſide the King is head of the Church, and on the other ſide that all points neceſſary to Salvation be plainly ſet down in Scripture, you (I ſay) muſt ſhew me plain Scripture for what you ſay in a point ſo neceſſary, as it is for ſo many millions to know ſo capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal a point as their head is. If for ſuch a point as this (to which ſo many were obliged to ſwear) you have no plain Text of Scripture, I pray tell us no more hereafter, that all neceſſary points are plainly ſet down in Scripture. I adde that either you muſt be far from having any evident Text for this point in Scripture, or your moſt illuminated <hi>Calvin</hi> could not ſee that which was evident, for he writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the 7th of <hi>Amos,</hi> ſaith of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church. <hi>They were blaſphemous when they called him</hi> (Henry the Eighth) <hi>chief Head of the Church under Chriſt.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Of my 11th. and 12th. Numb.</note>42. A fourth Controverſie not decidable by any clear Text of Scripture is, <hi>which be the true Books of Scripture, which not,</hi> about which we ſtill differ mainly. And it is evident no Text can decide this Controverſie: Of this in general I have ſpoken fully. That for which I repeated it over again is to preſſe particularly the impoſſibility that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40740:163"/> there is to prove by Scripture (againſt the <hi>Manicheans</hi>) that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> his Goſpel is the true uncorrupted Word of God. That it is impoſſible to know it to be Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes</hi> Goſpel you your ſelf confeſs, holding it in plain termes a point of no neceſſitie to believe this; yet ſure I am that your learned Brethren in their conference at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone,</hi> dared not to deny that it was an Article of faith to believe Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel to have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n written by Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> And I believe your own Brethren will be ſcandalized at this your Opinion. But before you can goe forward, to ſhew it impoſſible to prove by Scripture that Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel is the ſame uncorrupted Word of God, I am neceſſitated to Anſwer what ye Object by the way.</p>
            <p n="43">43. You ſay then firſt, <hi>That if the Church were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge of all Canonical Books, yet would it not follow from hence, that it ſhould be infallible Iudge in all points of Faith, unleſs cauſally, for we might ſuppoſe more aſſurance to the Church in this particular then in other caſes.</hi> Is it ſo good Sir? Can you ſuppoſe a point, upon which all depends, to be held by all as infallibly true, without ſhewing ſuch a point to be clearly contained in Scripture? Why this ſpoils all. Your onely ſhift, to avoid the neceſsitie of an infallible Church, is ſtill to ſay, that all neceſſary points are plainly ſet down in Scripture, and that if any point be not plainly ſet down in Scripture, it hereby appeareth not to be neceſſary. And will you now ſuppoſe this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of all points, which is not clearly ſet down in Scripture, to be admitted with infallible aſſent upon the only authority of the Church? That we are univerſally to hear the Church hath many pregnant places in Scripture, as I ſhall ſhew at large, C 4. But that we are to learn this one point, and none but this onely, from the infallible authority of the Church, hath no colour nor ſhadow of Scripture, or any thing like Scripture. You muſt therefore ground this your anſwer not upon Scripture, but upon
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40740:164"/> Reaſon. Now the Reaſon upon which you reject the Church from being an infallible Judge of Controverſies, is becauſe there is no neceſsity of ſuch a Judge, ſince the whole Canon of the Scripture was finiſhed. And for this onely Reaſon (without any Text) you put the Churches infallibility to expire and give up the Ghoſt at the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Canon of the Scripture. Now if the reaſon for which you diſcard the Churches infallibility, in other points, be this, that other points are cleared ſufficiently by Scripture: Then there can be no other prudent reaſon for which you in this one point may more aſſuredly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Church to be infallible, but that this one point cannot be ſufficiently cleared by Scripture; and that therefore only there is a greater neceſſity to have recourſe to the infallible authority of a Church, undoubtedly infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in this prime point, which point cauſally brings forth all others. This diſcourſe being evidently deduced out of your own prime principles, I pray mark two things which I am going to ſay. The firſt is, that this your anſwer over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth utterly that main ground of yours, <hi>That all points neceſſary are plainly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> For no point is more neceſſary then this without which there is no coming to the beliefe of any thing in Scripture, and yet this point is neither plainly nor obſcurely ſet down in Scripture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it be where we are Univerſally ſent to the Church for learning other points as well as this.</p>
            <p n="44">44. The Second thing I would have marked is, that you utterly overthrow that principle which is the ground-work of your faith. For if there be a greater neceſſity to acknowledge the infallibility of a Church, for as much as concerns this one point in particular, becauſe this one point in particular is leſſe clear in Scripture then any other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point; that grand principle of yours evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth falſe (though you ſpeak it for your ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſo cloſe after the other) <hi>That the Canonical Books bear witneſſe of themſelves, they carry their own light, which
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40740:164"/> we may ſee them by this as we ſee the Sunne by his own Light.</hi> How is it poſſible that there ſhould be a greater neceſſity on the one ſide to have recourſe to the Churches Authority as infallible in this particular point, becauſe it can leſſe be cleared by Scripture then other points, and yet on the other ſide, this point of all other points, hath this particular priviledge to be ſo manifeſt, <hi>That it bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſſe of its own ſelfe, that it carrieth its own Light with it,</hi> and ſuch a conſpicuous Light, <hi>that we may ſee this Verity by it, as we ſee the Sun by its own Light.</hi> But how vain this Ground is, upon which all muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, I have ſhewed largely from the 26. Number unto the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. As for your <hi>Dilemma,</hi> I have broken the <hi>Horns</hi> of it, Numb. 31.32, 33. And what you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay about Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> is anſwered, Numb. 27. And as for <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> if you had cited him in the very ſelf ſame Treatiſe in that place where he ſpeaketh of the <hi>Machabees</hi> in particular, (to wit, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>fine</hi>) He would have anſwered your Argument juſt as I anſwer it in that place. And note I pray by the way what you find, to wit, That the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the <hi>Machabees</hi> for true Scripture. Now if theſe Fathers were of your Religion, then you muſt make them agree with you in your prime Principles upon which you receive all Scriptures as Gods infallible Word, becauſe by their own light every Book is ſeen to be Canonical, as we ſee the Sun by its own light; Therefore according to you, theſe Fathers, did, by this light ſe theſe books of the <hi>Macha.</hi> to be canonical, by a light ſufficient to an infallibility. This muſt therfore be infallibly true, &amp; yet your <hi>Church</hi> denies it; nay you muſt ſay you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſe this light you ſay is ſo clear.</p>
            <p n="45">45. And I pray now aske me (as you doe) <hi>How I ſee Light?</hi> I Anſwer, with ſuch eyes as other men have, Who can ſee it as well as I. It hath little ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſneſſe in it, (pardon your owne words) to ſay that a thing is as viſible as Light, and as apparent as the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40740:165"/> firſt principles, and yet even at the very ſelf ſame time to ſay the moſt irradiated underſtandings of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> of <hi>the whole Council of Carthage,</hi> of Saint <hi>Hierom, of Luther, of their own ſelves;</hi> ſee by this Light, and by this prime Principle quite oppoſite Verities. But of this ſee yet more in my 27. Number. As for the infallibility of the Church, I do not prove it firſt by Scripture, but as I have told you Numb. 30.31, 32, 33. About believing Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel to have been written by him; I have ſaid enough, Numb. 42.</p>
            <p n="46">46. At laſt I have forced a paſſage to my intended ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument about Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, which I boldly ſay cannot poſſibly, by your principles, ever come to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, with an infallible aſſent to be Gods true uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Word. The <hi>Marcioniſts,</hi> the <hi>Cerdoniſts,</hi> the <hi>Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> do deny (and others may come to deny) the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> to be Gods true Word. This Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie (as all others) according to you muſt be ended by Scripture onely. But that is impoſſible, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth not ſo much as touch in one word this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. Therefore it is falſe that the Scripture doth plainly ſet down all neceſſary points, without you will ſay it is not neceſſary to believe Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel. Here you cannot fly to a Light as clear as the Sun ſhewing this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for your own doctrine is that <hi>Tranſlations are onely ſo far Gods Word as they agree with the Originals,</hi> as we have ſeen, Numb. 34.35. But we have onely Tranſlations of Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, and no Original copy at all; Therefore it is impoſſible for us (in your Principles) to know how far Saint <hi>Mattthews</hi> Goſpel is Gods Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſsible to know how far it agreeth with the Originals. Perhaps whole Chapters are left out, perhaps divers things here and there put in, or altered, for it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain who the Tranſlator was, and of what skill, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. The Church you confeſs (in your firſt anſwer) doth not certifie us; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this Anſwer is no Anſwer.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40740:165"/> For yet, you doe not ſhew, how we are certified of this truth, That this is the true uncorrupted Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> Secondly, you would tax us for ſaying that no one of the Antients conceived this Goſpel to be written in Greek. You might eaſily underſtand our meaning to be that no one of them can be produced as a witneſſe, ſo much as weakly moving us to believe this. For their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony (who did not write at all, or whoſe writings have periſhed) is no kind of Teſtimony, no more then if there never had been ſuch men. You adde that it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true that there is not a copy of the Hebrew Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel extant in all the world. Good Sir, in what year of our Lord, was it that I did ſay, <hi>that this was certainly true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Did not I ſay ſo this very laſt year, which was above twelve hundred years ſince Saint <hi>Jeroms</hi> time. If there were one Hebrew copy then, what is that to our purpoſe now? Can we go and confer our Tranſlations of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and ſee how far they agree with that Original copy which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his dayes did ſee in one only place of the world? Shew me ſo much as one Hebrew copy now extant in the whole world of ſufficient credit to ground an infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. If after more then a thouſand years loſs of all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal copies, <hi>Munſter,</hi> or any other private man, obtrude us an Hebrew Original, which hath lain all this while, God knowes where; by what Evidence will that appear Gods infallible and uncorrupted Word: All your ſhifts will not here help you.</p>
            <p n="48">48. You would ſhift firſt by asking how the Latine Interpretation came to be Authentique. I Anſwer, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was accepted for authentique, and thus declared to be ſo by the Church, which Church when ſhe admitted it, was fully ſatisfied that it agreed with the Original. And this ſhe knew by Tradition from the Church of former Ages. This Tradition doth not certifie you becauſe you hold it fallible. And therefore moſt certainly I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie you that you will never believe Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40740:166"/> with an infallible aſſent until you believe the Church infallible in her traditions. Your ſecond ſhift is, this <hi>Goſpel might poſſibly at the firſt be written in Greek.</hi> Good Sir, tell me whether onely poſſibilities grounded upon conjectures be ſufficient to ground an infallible aſſent. And here give me leave by the way to ſhew you once more the evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence which is in that light by which you ſee Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel (for example) to be Gods true word, and ſo of all other Scriptures. The Greek Copy of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> you ſee as evidently as the Sun to be Gods true Word by reading of it, and yet this great Evidence is ſo little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that Evident inevidence, (which you call a Poſſibilitie) that Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Greek Copy is Gods true and uncorrupted Word, that you cannot ſee (with your ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiated underſtanding) whether this inevidence be not to the full as good as that Evidence, and that it may not as well ground an infallible aſſent as that. Again, how come you to hold it a meer <hi>Poſsibility</hi> that Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel was written in Greek; for if the Greek Text of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> be as truly Original as that of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> your irradiated underſtanding muſt needs by its Light, ſee it to be Gods Word, as well as you ſee the Sun by its Light; why then do you venture no further then to eſteem it <hi>a poſsibilitie.</hi> Is it a mere poſſibilitie that St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel is Gods uncorrupted word? Now let us ſee how ſlender your Conjecture is (though I confeſs it to be better in my judgement, then the light manifeſting to you infallibly the truth of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel:) Let us ſee, I ſay how ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Conjecture is to prove <hi>that poſsibly Saint Matthews Goſpel might be written firſt in Greek, becauſe the Greek Copy interpreteth the Hebrew word, Emmanuel;</hi> which if it were written in Hebrew, needed not any interpretation. A pittiful weak Conjecture. And this Dart is no ſooner raiſed above your head with weak hand, but it falls with a ſtrong hand, upon your head again. The Greek Copy tranſlateth Hebrew words, therefore
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40740:166"/> (ſay you) it is no Tranſlation, but it is an Original. Sir, it is manifeſt that Tranſlations of Scripture uſually tell us the Hebrew words firſt, and then the Tranſlation of it. So <hi>Geneſis</hi> 31.48. <hi>Galaad, id eſt, tumulus teſtis. Galaad,</hi> that is, the witneſſe heap. And <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.18. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noni, id eſt, filius doloris mei. Benjamin, id filius dextrae.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>Phaſe, id eſt, tranſitus.</hi> And <hi>Exodus</hi> 26. <hi>Manhu, quod ſignificat quid eſt hoe.</hi> By theſe and divers ſuch places you ſee how familiarly Tranſlatours tell you the Hebrew word, and then the Interpretation of it. No prophane mean authoritie would upon ſo ſlight a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture as this is, be rejected and contradicted. Much leſſe if he made himſelf an eye-witneſſe of what he ſaid. Yet you reject Saint <hi>Jerom,</hi> though he ſaith he did ſee a copy of the Hebrew Original with his own eyes, and you reject him though <hi>all the Fathers writings extant</hi> ſtand on his ſide, and this upon a moſt ſlender conjecture of your own, which would have made another man more wiſely conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture the quite contrary, and ſay, <hi>this copy Tranſlateth,</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>it is a Tranſlation.</hi> Whence it evidently appears how little you care either for the ſingle, or for the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of Eminent Fathers. But this being a point onely to bee tried by the Teſtimony of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, your Cauſe is loſt without ſome good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours can be found for you. Your third ſhift is in place of giving a Solution to make an Objection, asking, <hi>Why our Latine Tranſlation was made Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, if the Church had made the Greeke Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that I know of no body who told you, That the Greeke Tranſlation was made Authentique by the Church. Neither Greeke nor Latine can be Authentique but by the Church, becauſe the Hebrew Original being loſt, we cannot know how farre either Greek or Latine Tranſlation agreeth with the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but by the infallible Tradition of the Church, you, who
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40740:167"/> reject this, cannot know poſſibly how far tranſlations be Gods uncorrupted word, for (as you ſay) they are only ſo far Gods uncorrupted Word as they agree with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; But you know not how far they agree with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. <hi>Ergo</hi> you know not how far they be Gods word. Your fourth ſhift is to pretend to this knowledge by the Harmony with the other Goſpels. Sir If any man intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a ſuppoſititious Goſpel; do you not think he would take care, not to contradict the others. But what harmony can there be found in theſe many things related by Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and not related at all by any others? Yea, one of the greateſt difficulties againſt Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel is to ſhew that it exactly agreeth with other Scriptures from the beginning to the ending. And to be the briefer I will onely inſtance in ſome places of the beginning and ending omitting all the reſt. In the very firſt Chapter Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us that <hi>Ioram did beget Ozias;</hi> And yet out of the fourth Book of <hi>Kings</hi> (which your Bible is pleaſed to call the Second Book) it is manifeſt that <hi>Ioram begat Ochozias</hi> C. 8. And <hi>that Ochozias did beget Ioas,</hi> C. 11. And that <hi>Ioas begat Amaſias,</hi> C. 12. and this <hi>Amaſias begat Azarias</hi> C. 14. who is called here in Saint <hi>Matthew, Ozias.</hi> I ask then how cometh Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> to ſay <hi>Ioas begat Ozias,</hi> who was born three Generations after him. And being that theſe three Generations hapned between the time of <hi>David,</hi> and the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they beeing added to the other 14 Generations doe make them to be ſeaventeen. How then is it true which Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith verſe 17. <hi>that all Generations from David until the carrying away into Babilon are fourteen.</hi> For all theſe Generations were Seventeen. Again he ſaith, <hi>there were fourteen Generations from Abraham to David,</hi> and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fourteen now mentioned) that there were <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more Generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Chriſt.</hi> Count now thrice fourteen Generations, and they in all will make fourty two. But I pray now take
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40740:167"/> your fingers, and count all the Generations ſpecified in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and you ſhall find them to be only fourty one. A wonderful exceeding great difficulty. And this for the beginning. Now towards the end of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſee the Twenty ſeven Chapter v. 9. <hi>Then was fulfilled that which</hi> was <hi>ſaid by the Prophet Jeremy;</hi> Read all the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> and he hath no ſuch matter in him. What Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny appeareth here? Indeed in the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> (C. 11.) there is in ſubſtance what Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaid in his former Chapter about the denial of Chriſt by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> how much do Interpreters ſweat to reconcile what Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith with that which other Evangiliſts ſay, which ſeem to differ in very many circumſtances. No leſs, yea far greater difficulty is it, to make all that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith in his laſt Chapter concerning ſome Circumſtances of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, as the attentive Reader may eaſily ſee. Now I pray tell me if it be not a plain Paradox to ſay that the agreeing of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> with other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is ſo apparent, that even from hence a man may know his Goſpel to be infallibly Gods word, whereas the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diſagreeing bringeth moſt vaſt difficulties, as I have ſhewed. Your fifth and laſt ſhift is, <hi>That all the people do fixe their faith upon that which is interpreted and not upon the Interpretation.</hi> If you do ſo, then for any thing you know, you may fixe your faith upon a Lye: for how know you whether the thing delivered you by the Interpreter be Gods Word, or the Interpreters own word? Eſpecially when we know not who this Interpreter was, how skilful, how faithful, how true a Copy he uſed? How know you that this tranſlator doth not convey his own phanſies in place of Gods Word? Do you know it becauſe your fancy alſo tells you that this is Gods Word, then thus we may have a double phantaſticall aſſurance, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. This you are forced to hold ſufficient, yet how doth this agree with your owne words, <hi>Tranſlations are only ſo far Gods Words as they agree with the Originals,</hi> you
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40740:168"/> cannot reſolve your faith into the Original never propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto you, into the Tranſlation you ſay you do not reſolve it, yet you reſolve it into the written word. What written word is that, which is neither Tranſlation nor Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal? This I ask and this you are bound to tell me, being your very main Poſition is that all you believe is reſolv'd in to the written words. If the Illumination of the Spirit can tell you Gods word without any certain aſſured conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means, you muſt needs be a prophet, you muſt needs have far more then you will allow to the Church. You muſt needs know which of thoſe ſo many Greek Copies, is the only true one. And by the like illumination of the Spirit any clown neither underſtanding Latine, Greek or Hebrew, will be able infallibly to know which <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation is Gods true Word. And if you ſay he cannot becauſe he cannot confer it with the Original, he will tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you that he can confer it with the Original, as much as you can confer any Tranſlation of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> with the Original, which not being Extant in the whole World can no more be looked upon by you who know Hebrew, then by him. To other Tranſlations you give but humane credit, ſuch as he giveth to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>Now after you have given to every one of your own any Illumination of Spirit ſufficient to know infallibly Gods Word without having any better conveyance, then a humane Tranſlation, you (very judiciouſly) deny any ſuch Illumination to the Church, becauſe ſhe erred in Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Ipſa</hi> for <hi>ipſum.</hi> It is clear ſome Hebrew copies may moſt exactly be Tranſlated <hi>Ipſum,</hi> how know you the Church followed the falſe Hebrew Copy? How many moſt grave and moſt ancient Fathers have alſo read <hi>Ipſa.</hi> And it was a loud lye of <hi>Kemnitius</hi> to ſay the contrary. See the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40740:168"/> is Authentique, and not deficient in any point concerning faith or manners; when the Church ſhall declare as much of the Greek, that may then be believed Authentique; if both be Authentique upon the Churches Declaration, yet you, who believe her Declarations to be fallible, will ſtill have a onely fallible ground for that aſſent which you give to Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel. So that all your ſhifts fail you in this important point of Faith towards a whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. All that you prove concerning other points debated between us out of Holy Fathers, ſince they find ſo little credit with you) after their Authoritie is demonſtrated to ſtand for ſuch or ſuch a point) are not to be inſiſted upon until you eſteem them more.</p>
            <p n="49">49. I come then to what you ſay to my 13. Number,<note place="margin">Of my 13th. Number.</note> where I Object <hi>Luthers</hi> not ſeeing the Apocalyps and the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>James</hi> to be Canonical by their own light. Your firſt anſwer is, <hi>That a Negative Argument from one is not cogent, for it followeth not he did not ſee, therefore he could not ſee it?</hi> Sir, in our caſe a Negative Argument is a ſtrong proof, and as ſtrong an one as this. <hi>I doe not ſee (endeavouring to ſee, and having good eyes wide open) a light as viſible by its light, as the Sun by his light:</hi> Ergo, <hi>there is no ſuch light ſtanding before me.</hi> You will grant <hi>Luthers</hi> Eyes as good as your own, his Underſtanding as Irradiated as your own; the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> ſtood before his eyes as clearly as yours, what ſhould hinder him from ſeeing it, and make you ſee it? The light is the ſame, the Propoſition of it the ſame, your eyes or underſtanding no better, nor more aſſiſted. Secondly, you anſwer that <hi>hence we ſee you do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in all things blindly.</hi> Sir, the Queſtion is here, who is blind, and truly blind. For you ſay that a light, no leſſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by it ſelf then the Sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is, ſtands before both your eyes in the reading of the <hi>Apocal.</hi> and yet the one believeth as truly as he believeth any thing that he ſeeth this light, the other will venture his ſalvation that he ſeeth it not, for, in the ſame book of <hi>Apocalyps</hi> laſt Chap. verſe 1. it is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40740:169"/> ſaid. <hi>If any man ſhall take away from the words of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life. Luther</hi> took all the book away; you hold it all Scripture, and yet him a Saint. You goe on, and adde <hi>that the Apocalyps and other Books alſo have been doubted of.</hi> But do you not mark the more doubt there hath been of them, the more evident it is that they moſt ungroundedly be affirmed by you <hi>to carry their own light by which they may be ſeen, as we ſee the Sun by his own light.</hi> Again, being you neither agree with us in the Canon of the Scripture, nor with your own Brethren, what reaſon have you to obtrude a Canon of your own coyning to us for Judge of all Controverſies, you not agreeing nor knowing how many books make up the true Canon, and all agreeing that divers books of the true Canon be quite loſt? Where ſhall we find this our Judge? Among us (after the Church Delaration was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified concerning the receiving of any book for Canonical) you will never find it doubted of by any true Catholiques. You are miſtaken, if you think Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> held the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees</hi> not to be Canonical after the definition of the Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi> It was before that Council that he writ what he writ.

               </note>50. In my 14. Num. for a further proof that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alone cannot decide all controverſies, I did and do ſtill inſiſt upon this argument, that almoſt all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies do ariſe about the true ſenſe of ſuch or ſuch a Text in Scripture. The ſenſe is the kernel, the life, the Soul of the text; miſſe in this, miſſe in all. And yet about this ſenſe greateſt wits vaſtly differ in many points neceſſary to Salvation, and conſequently many miſſe the true ſenſe to their eternall damnation. This book of the Scripture, by it ſelf alone could never yet end theſe differences; Therefore if God had left us no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40740:169"/> means to end our differences, but this Book, about the true underſtanding of which all our differences ariſe, he ſhould have no better provided for our unity (even in points neceſſary to Salvation) then that Law-maker, who ſhould leave his Common-wealth a Book of Laws to end all their Controverſies in Law, about the meaning of which Book, he knew all the cheifeſt Controverſies would ſtill ariſe. This is indeed a repetition of what I ſaid, but it is a repetition of what you have not yet anſwered. For againſt your firſt anſwer it is apparent that there is not only a neceſſity of a judge different from Scripture, to declare unto us, which books be the true and uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word of God; but there is alſo a main neceſſity of ſuch a judge to know the undoubted meaning of Gods undou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bted Word, about which there be far more controverſies in points neceſſary to Salvation. And though, in your ſecond anſwer, you tell us, that all points neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are plainly ſet down in Scripture, yet I have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved the contrary Chap. 3 Num. 200. And my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (Contrary to your 3. Anſwer) is affectual, for in points neceſſary to Salvation, to be believed with divine faith, we muſt have an infallible authority to rely on, for that faith, which relieth upon a fallible authority, cannot be an infallible aſſent. And again if we have not full ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of this infallible authority, we cannot aſſent unto it with an aſſent infallible, to which we being obliged by God, God alſo muſt have furniſhed us of full ſecurity to know this authority to be infallible, as I have ſhewed him to do. And yet again, that this infallible authority, ſo well ſecured is inveſted in the Church appeareth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by this, that the Scriptures not aſſiſting us in the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible knowledge of their own true ſenſe, in points neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed with infallible faith, we muſt be aſſiſted to this infallible knowledge by ſom other infallible means (for fallible will not do the deed.) No other infallible means can, with any ſhadow of probability, be ſaid given
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40740:170"/> unto us, but the infallible authority of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore her authority muſt be infallible, as ſhall at large be proved in the next Chapter, and then (in the next after that) I will ſhew that this infallible Church is the Roman, and none but the Roman.</p>
            <p n="51">51. Again, I ſaid, that if Chriſt had intended the Book of Scriptures for the judge of all Controverſies, the knowledge of this point being ſo primely neceſſary, muſt needs be according to your principles evidently ſet down in Scripture, in w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all points neceſſary to ſalvation are (as you ſay) evidently ſet down. You pretend here this point to be clear in Scripture, but I have largely ſhewed the contrary and anſwered your objection. And I retort it thus, that if God would have us in all controverſies guided by the Scripture only he would clearly have ſaid ſo in theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yea he would have told us the true undoubted Canon of Scripture. This is now unknown to you: And we are ſure diverſe parts of this Canon are loſt, what Scripture tels us <hi>we muſt be judged by only part of Scripture?</hi> I pray anſwer this.</p>
            <p n="52">
               <note place="margin">Of my 14th. Number.</note>52. Moreover I added <hi>that if God would have given us a Book for our Judge, he would never have given us for our Judge ſuch a Book as the Scripture is, which very often ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth obſcurely, ſometime ſo prophetically, that moſt would think it ſpoke of the preſent time, when it ſpeaketh of the time to come, that it ſpeaks of one perſon, for example of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, when it ſpeaketh of another, for example of Chriſt;</hi> and much more I added to this effect, that I might be rightly underſtood when I ſaid that <hi>God would never have given us ſuch a book for our Judge.</hi> My adverſarie to avoid this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſo mangleth the ſenſe, that he may make my words ſound of a blaſphemous diſreſpect by reporting them as if I ſhould have ſaid, <hi>If God had intended Scripture for our Judge, he would not have given us ſuch a Book as Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Which words taken without thoſe particles, <hi>for our Iudge,</hi> ſeem to ſound <hi>ſuch an imperfect book as Scripture,</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:40740:170"/> but taken with thoſe particles (which purpoſely were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to make the ſenſe of the writer appear) the ſenſe can offend no man capable of ſenſe. For what man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding would affectionately crie out <hi>of diſreſpect, if not of blaſphemy againſt Scripture,</hi> if he ſhould hear one ſay, <hi>if God had intended ſtill the Scripture for ſole Judge in all Law Controverſies, he would never have given us ſuch a Book as the Scripture is for our Iudge.</hi> Would any ſober man let fall ſuch a cenſure upon ſuch an occaſion? Is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the Scripture may be a Book as perfect as can be for the intent for which God made it, and yet not be fit to decide all Controverſies by it ſelf alone, it never being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for that end. It is ſufficient that this Book pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides an infallible means to judge them, by ſending us to the Church for our Judge. They truly diſgrace the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, who will firſt make men believe that all neceſſary Controverſies are plainly decided by Scripture alone, and that God intended the Scripture for the plain deciſion of them, and then, when it comes to the trial, are not able to ſhew any Text of Scripture, deciding many and moſt important Controverſies: for, this is in effect to ſay, God performed very unſufficiently what he intended to do, by Scripture. If what I ſaid gave you any advantage, ſhew it by diſproving what I ſaid.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Firſt, you ask how theſe words are put together, <hi>ſo Prophetically, that moſt would think that the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the time preſent, when it ſpeaketh of the time to come?</hi> I anſwer, that it was fit the old Teſtament ſhould be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, and I intended nothing leſſe then to blame Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And yet I ſay, that when the Scripture uſeth ſuch words as ſignifie to us a veritie preſent, as well as a veritie future, we (who have nothing but theſe words to direct us) cannot tell infallibly whether God intended by them to ſpeak onely of what was preſent, or of what was to come. And ſo Gods meaning in all theſe places is obſcure unto us. And if you can help us to any aſſured means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40740:171"/> infallibly the hidden ſenſe of God, utter'd in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, you ſhall do more then any of your Doctors ever did. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whereas you think it little to the purpoſe of him, who is to ſhew in how doubtful terms the Scriptures ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſe themſelves, when they ſpoke ſo, that you cannot tell whether <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf or of Chriſt, your judgement is very different from <hi>Candaris,</hi> that wiſe judicious man, <hi>who had charge of all the Treaſure of the Queen of Aethiopia,</hi> (Acts 8.27.) He read <hi>Iſaias,</hi> the cleareſt of all the Prophets concerning Chriſt, and he read a place as clearly ſpeaking of Chriſt, as moſt places you can turn unto with all your skill, and yet when <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Underſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> He, who was ſo prudent, and ſo ſincere a ſearcher of the Truth anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>How can I except ſome man ſhould guide me?</hi> And then he asked of his guide, that, of which he moſt doubted; <hi>I pray thee of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet this? of himſelf or of ſome other man?</hi> Had you been there you would have told him he had blamed Scripture as you tell me for the like cauſe. Who doubteth but Prophets ſhould ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically. And yet again, who doubteth but that this their ſpeaking ſo, makes them to need a Guide &amp; an Interpreter.</p>
            <p n="54">54. I do not think that among your own Clergie or Laitie, you are as much eſteemed as he who ſpoke as fully of this point as I did: I mean Doctor <hi>Ieremy Taylor in his Diſcourſe of the Liberty of Prophecying,</hi> Sect. 3. where he proveth the uncertaintie of Arguments from Scripture, <hi>By the many ſenſes of Scripture, when the Grammatical ſenſe is found out: for there is in very many Scriptures a double ſenſe, a Literal and a Spiritual, and both theſe Senſes are ſubdivided. For the Literal ſenſe is either Natural or Figurative, and the Spiritual ſometimes Allegorical, ſometimes Anagogical, ſometimes there are divers literal Senſes in the ſame place;</hi> ſo he. Now it depends upon the ſecret intention of the Holy Ghoſt to have uſed theſe words in ſome one onely, or two, or more of theſe ſenſes. Is there no difficultie
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40740:171"/> think you in finding out ſo great a ſecret, and that infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie as we muſt do in points neceſſary to ſalvation? And if you ſay the ſenſe is alwaies cleared out of ſome Text or other in ſuch points, you ſay more then you can prove. Take for an example theſe four words: <hi>This is my Body,</hi> you muſt ſay they are ſpoken in a Figurative ſenſe, and not in their Natural ſenſe: ſhew this in a Figurative ſenſe to be infallibly the true ſenſe by any other clear Text, or elſe you ſhew not what you ſay. Two hundred ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations have been given of theſe four words. Is this a ſign that true ſenſe is eaſily known, and known infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? Is not this about a point neceſſarie to ſalvation?</p>
            <p n="55">55. To ſhew further the difficulty there was to know the undoubted meaning of Scripture even in precepts, (which being precepts are damnably broken) I uſed this argument: the Scripture uſeth the Imperative Mood as well when it counſels as when it commands. What infallible means then have we to know what is recommended onely to us as a Counſel or Command, as a precept to be kept under pain of damnation; Inſtead of teaching me this means you ſay <hi>you cannot ſwallow this without chewing, becauſe I ſuppoſe that there are Counſels of perfection above things of Command;</hi> whileſt you chew this, do not you ſee that your teeth bite Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> who expreſly ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with me, that <hi>there be counſels of perfections above things of Command.</hi> For (1 Cor. 7.25.) he ſaith. <hi>Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virgins I have no Commandement of our Lord, yet I give Counſel.</hi> And Verſe 38. <hi>He that giveth his daughter in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage doth well, but he that giveth her not in marriage doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> How doth this agree with your ſtrange Divinity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we have done but our duty, and what we are obliged to do under a damnable ſin, when we have done as much as we could. Is this true? Might not this man have given his daughter in marriage who doth not give her? He might have done ſo, and done well accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> According to you he is bound to do
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40740:172"/> all that he could do. But he could have done better in not giving her to marriage, therefore according to you he was bound not to give her under pain of damnation. Here I muſt intreat you to mark the words of the Text you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge againſt me, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>So likewiſe when you have done all thoſe things which are commanded you;</hi> (he ſaith not which are onely commended by way of Council) <hi>ſay we are unprofitable ſervants, we have done what we ought to do,</hi> to wit, by an expreſſe Precept obliging under damnation. In one ſenſe this man who hath not married his daughter, may truly ſay, I have done what I ought to do, not out of ſtrict Obligation, binding under pain of Hell-fire; (for I might have done well in doing the contrarie,) but what I ought to do, out of more perfect charitie. To ſwallow this Apoſtolical Doctrine is far eaſier then to admit into ones mouth thoſe words of yours. <hi>The Commandements of God are given to us according to the tenour of our abilitie in Adam.</hi> What evident Text teacheth this? I am ſure Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandements. He that ſaith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> John 2. Therefore ſince <hi>Adams</hi> dayes God enabled us to keep his Commandements.</p>
            <p n="56">56. You go on as if I found fault with Scripture. I only find fault with thoſe who affirm Scripture to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God for an end, to which I ſhew it never was intended. Becauſe if it had been intended by God to teach us clearly all things neceſſarie to ſalvation (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by ſending us to the Church, and by bidding us keep our received Traditions) it would have ſet the things down clearly and diſtinctly, and not have left theſe points to be picked out, one out of one book, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other out of another, no man knoweth directly where; yea divers books contained not ſo much as one of theſe points, which you hold neceſſarie to ſalvation, eſpecially in plain and clear terms. And thoſe books which do contain
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40740:172"/> ſuch points do intermingle ſo many other leſſe neceſſarie points, or points of doubtful neceſſitie, with thoſe which are wholly neceſſarie (without ever telling us of this leſſe or greater neceſſitie) that all the whole Bible muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully, and very attentively read over (which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, becauſe divers whole Books of the Bible are loſt) before a man can come to the infallible knowledge of ſuch points as you will ſay are neceſſarie, which points you ſay are but few, and the Books of Scripture are many, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers more have been written and quite loſt; and how can we tell whether all theſe we have now, contain all points neceſſarie? For the moſt you pretend is, that in the whole Canon all points neceſſarie were delivered; we have not the whole Canon, but diverſe books of it have periſhed; Therefore we have no aſſurance that the Scripture we have containeth all things neceſſarie. The Scriptures we have, make a book ſo big, that the far greater part of the world (taken up with ſo many neceſſarie affairs) cannot in a very long ſpace of time read over this Book with any part of that exactneſſe, which according to your own Principles, muſt be required to find out, which points be neceſſarie to ſalvation. For to do this, they muſt firſt read over the whole Canon, and yet divers books of it are loſt, and not to be had, how ſhall they read them? Secondly, to have aſſurance that they have read over the whole Canon, they muſt read over ſuch books as we hold to be part of the true Canon, to ſee whether they be ſo or no, and uſe ſuch diligences as are neceſſarie for an infallible aſſurance. <hi>They muſt alſo</hi> note moſt accurately all places which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps clearly deliver a neceſſarie point, when they ſhall have been conferred with other places, which perhaps be at the other end of the Bible, or may occur to me when I leſſe obſerve any kind of connexion with what I read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Beſides this,</hi> for fear Tranſlations (which are only ſo farre Gods Word as they agree with the Original) ſhould be taken by me for Gods true Word; I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40740:173"/> with the Original, and with the true Original, of which I cannot get an undoubted copy infallibly ſecured from corruption, Is it likely that God, who hath promiſed us <hi>a Way ſo direct unto us that fools cannot erre by it,</hi> would intend to lead us by a way having ſo many paſſages open to errour. Theſe difficulties ſhew that God did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Book to be our onely guide. His wiſedome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects him to the beſt means to compaſſe his intention. Even our ordinarie wiſedom (if we had an intention to ſet forth a writing to end all neceſſarie Controverſies) would direct us to ſet down plainly and clearly in one place all thoſe (few as you ſay) points neceſſarie to be believed. When God determined to ſet down all the Jewiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, you ſee how fully, particularly, and clearly he ſetteth them down in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> Points of faith neceſſarie to ſalvation import incomparably more then points of meer Ceremonie. If then God had intended a Book, by which only he was reſolved to deliver unto us all points neceſſary to ſalvation, theſe points (as you ſay) being but few, he would in ſome one part of theſe books have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down theſe few points, a thouſand times more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting then the points of Ceremonies. Many hold that the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>John</hi> were written after his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and ſo (by order of time) that they were the very laſt part of the Canon. And yet in the very laſt part (of this my laſt part) of the Canon, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>I had many things to write, but I will not with inke and pen write them. But I truſt we ſhall ſee thee ſhortly, and we ſhall ſpeak face to to face.</hi> No man can ſay that <hi>theſe many things</hi> which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had to write, were things unneceſſarie; wherfore many neceſſary things may not be ſet down in the Canon. And yet the Canon is very compleat in order to its true end, and alſo in order to the ending of all Controverſies by ſending us to the Church for full inſtruction, as I have ſhewed. And it is apparently falſe which you ſay, that the Scripture doth give us everie particular point which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40740:173"/> to be believed, as I have ſhewed in this Chapter. And whereas you adde ſecondly, <hi>That the Scripture giveth alſo many points not neceſſary,</hi> you mark not that the vaſt number of thoſe points among which, here, and there (we are not aſſured where) the neceſſarie points are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled from the beginning of the Bible to the end, is a thing which would make any man far from being fully aſſured, that Gods intention was by this Book alone to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all Controverſies about points onely neceſſarie, which might far more eaſily for our capacitie, have been done in ſome one Chapter of ſome one of theſe Books.</p>
            <p n="57">57. After this you urge that our Church hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided all neceſſary Controverſies. Sir, Our Doctrine is that the Church can decide any point formerly revealed when any neceſſity ſhall require it or the declaration of this point concern our Salvation. Salvation hath very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely been had without the deciſion of thoſe points you ſpeak of. If circumſtances happen that Salvation cannot be had without their deciſion, they will then be decided. If you acknowledge a real neceſſity to be at all times of the infallible knowledge of thoſe points then by your own principles you are bound to ſay that they are plainly ſet down in Scripture. And I am ſure our Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that we are obliged to believe all Scripture with an undoubtful beliefe, either you muſt ſay theſe points are not neceſſary, and then all your arguments fall of themſelves, or elſe you muſt ſay theſe be plainly ſet down in Scripture, and then we are by our Church obliged to believe them with divine faith. I adde that our whole Church teacheth the definitions of Councils confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to be infallible. Submit to this Judge appointed by God, who did bid us hear the Church, and you ſhall find her definitions not to leave you ignorant of what is neceſſary for you to know. To cavil at her, you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that to be neceſſary which you will ſay the next moment is unneceſſary.</p>
            <p n="58">
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:40740:174"/>58. But to ſhew you further that the Scripture is not clear in all points neceſſary to Salvation, with ſuch cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie as is neceſſary to put an end effectually to all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, I take a point or two ſet down with full as great clarity as diverſ other points can be ſhew'd to be ſet down; which other points, you do affirme both to be neceſſary to Salvation, and alſo to be ſet down clear enough, to decide the Controverſie for you; though they be ſet down with no greater claritie then thoſe points which I will ſpecifie; and which you will ſay be not ſet down clear enough to decide the Controverſie for us: whence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence of your proceedings will be made evident, whileſt all ſhall ſee, that you will pretend ſuch a degree of clarity in the Texts which you uſe to alledge for ſuch points, to be ſufficient to decide them for you, and by and by they ſhall ſee again a higher degree of clarity reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by you as unſufficient to decide a point againſt you. To prove this the firſt point I ſpecifie is of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction. The text in your own Bible ſpeaketh thus, James 5.14. <hi>Is any ſick among you, let him call for the Elders</hi> (Prieſts) <hi>of the Church. And let them pray over him anointing him with oyle in the name of our Lord. And the prayer of the faithfull ſhall ſave the ſick; And the Lord ſhall raiſ him up. And if he hath committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> What imports a dying man more then to have that applied to him in due manner by which he may be ſecured (upon the word of a God) that, <hi>if he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſins they ſhall be forgiven him?</hi> And yet you cry <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuperſtition.</hi> If a Prieſt be called for to pray over a ſick man, and <hi>to anoint him with oile,</hi> which is that Viſible Act to which inviſible grace, juſtifiing from ſinne, is promiſed in thoſe words, <hi>And if he hath committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> How clear this place is, appeares by the very letter, in which we have all we deſire to make a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. A Viſible ſigne of inviſible grace. You will ſay, this clarity is not in a degree ſufficient to make a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40740:174"/> with divine faith, that this Unction of anointing is a Sacrament, or a Viſible ſigne of inviſible Grace. And (ſo ſoon as I ſhall ask) you will tell me that your grand fundamental and Capital point, <hi>All things neceſſarie to Salvation are clearly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> is a point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Scripture by Texts, having a ſufficient degree of clarity to make it an Article to be believed with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith; I call for thoſe Texts, and you do give them as well as you can, (as I ſuppoſe) I examine them all in this Chapter (from my eighth Number to my fifteenth) and I dare Venture my life that no wiſe conſcionable man will ſay that any one of thoſe texts, or all put together, doe with as great a degree of claritie affirm <hi>All things neceſſarie to Salvation to be plainly ſet down in Scripture alone,</hi> as this text I alledged affirmeth this Sacrament of Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But this, you ſay, is not affirmed with a degree of Clarity ſufficient to decide the Controverſie for us, and to ground an infallible belief of this point, Therefore that degree of Clarity is not ſufficient to decide in your behalf that capital Controverſie, and to ground an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible beliefe of it. And yet for many other points (which I ſpecified in the beginning of this Chapter) you have not ſo much Scripture as you have for this prime point, though I did chuſe this for my inſtance, becauſe I had examined all your texts. You give two anſwers to this Objection. The firſt is, that, <hi>if the Scripture hath decided this point for us, then the Scripture can judge and end Controverſies.</hi> But Sir, doth it hence follow that it can end all neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, becauſe it can end this one Controverſie? Again, is this Controverſie by this Text ended? Doe not you ſtill ſtand out in the contrarie opinion? This Text indeed might (as I ſaid) ſeem in the impartial judgement of a prudent man, to ſay evidently that this anointing is a Sacrament, and ſure I am that it ſaith it clearer then any Scripture you can bring for many points which you ſay are clearly decided by Scripture; yet we
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:40740:175"/> ſee by the experience which we have of you, and yours, that even this great degree of claritie in this Text will not ſerve to convince your judgments, whence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly inferred that a leſſe degree of claritie (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is the higheſt, which can be found in many Texts that be the cleareſt alledgeable for many points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation) will not effectually end the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about thoſe points. And therefore there muſt be ſome other means to end them. Your Second Anſwer is flatly againſt the Text, for you ſay <hi>theſe words do only relate to the guift of healing in thoſe daies:</hi> and the Scripture ſaith they have alſo a relation to the healing of the Soul. <hi>If he hath committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> I pray what Scripture have you to prove that the Elders in thoſe daies did commonly cure all ſick anointing them with oile? I am ſure you can alledge nothing but ſome uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conjecture. I asked you alſo if you had one place of Scripture half as clear againſt this Sacrament of anointing, as the Text I brought was clear for it? But you neither did nor could give me any.</p>
            <p n="59">59. The ſecond point which I did chuſe to prove that ſuch Texts of Scripture, as are clearer then thoſe Texts, which you can alledge for many neceſſarie points; for example clearer then any Text for the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or baptizing children, is (notwithſtanding this greater degree of claritie) rejected by you, as not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the controverſie againſt you. Therefore I ſay, you moſt inconſequently proceed when you affirm far leſſe clearer Texts ſufficient to decide all Controverſies. The Text brought by me, and rejected thus by you, was, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Words expreſſed by four ſeveral Writers of the Scripture without any intimation of their being ſpoken Figuratively. And if you confer this place with the ſixth of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> he hath theſe words, <hi>The bread that I will give is my fleſh,</hi> and then (as it were purpoſely to ſhew he ſpoke not Figuratively) he added, <hi>My Fleſh is meat indeed,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40740:175"/> and my Blood is drink indeed.</hi> Notwithſtanding theſe ſo <hi>clear</hi> Texts you hold that the Scripture decideth this point againſt us with a deciſion ſufficient to end the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, And yet for the contrarie all the Texts you can bring have not that degree of claritie which theſe Texts have againſt you. But you deny that theſe Texts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide againſt you. Therefore (to ſpeak with tolerable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) you ſhould acknowledge that leſſe clear Texts cannot decide againſt us; yet being, by your owne main principle, bound to ſhew that all points neceſſarie be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined according to truth in Scripture, you are put upon a neceſſitie to ſay that leſſe clear Texts ſuffice to determine this controverſie for you, though you ſtifly maintain that more clear Texts are not able to determine againſt you. By which it is apparent how falſe that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is which forceth you to utter theſe inconſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. By this alſo you may ſee that the Contradiction you would find in my words for ſaying on the one ſide <hi>theſe Texts are clear,</hi> and on the other ſide <hi>that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie the Scripture doth</hi> not <hi>decide,</hi> doth ariſe out of my ſpeaking according to your principles. For you on the one ſide ſay that other Texts (which are manifeſtly leſſe clear) are clear enough to end the controverſies; therefore theſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are clearer, muſt needs be clear enough for that end. And again you ſay on the other ſide, by theſe our Texts (clearer then yours) this Controverſie is not clearlie deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Therefore I muſt conſequentlie ſay, that according to you <hi>This Controverſie the Scripture doth not decide.</hi> It is according to your Principles that theſe Texts <hi>muſt be clear,</hi> becauſe they be clearer then thoſe which you are forced to affirme clear; and again you muſt ſay <hi>they be not clear,</hi> for fear you ſhould confeſs them to decide againſt you. Now if theſe two places be denied to be clear, with a clarity ſufficient to put an end to the Controverſie, then according to my principles ſcarce any Controverſie will ever be decided by any Text. And this is moſt for my turn
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40740:176"/> to ſhew the neceſſity of a living Judge: whereas afterwards you take occaſion to diſpute of this Sacrament, you do not do it as it ſhould here have been done to the preſent purpoſe, to wit, by alledging more clear Texts to prove that Chriſts true body is not really in the Sacrament, then I alledge to prove that it was really in it. For theſe Texts I do call, Theſe Texts I require. Without you give me theſe more clear Texts, you will never give me a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie anſwer. All other things I wave of until I have theſe clearer Texts. The difference of theſe two hundred interpretations about theſe four words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> though they be not owned by you, yet they make ſtrongly againſt you in this reſpect, that they ſhew the Text of Scripture not to have ended, but to have occaſioned theſe endleſſe differences. And conſequently they ſhew this point not to be clear out of Scripture. You in vain are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about other things which are not to the purpoſe, ſo to entertain your Reader that he may not mark your omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the main point, which was to ſhew this great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to be clearly decided on your ſide by Scripture onely.</p>
            <p n="60">
               <note place="margin">Of my 15th. Number.</note>60. I go on ſtill preſſing other points, the belief of which points your ſelf hold neceſſarie to ſalvation, and yet you cannot ſhew them evidently taught in Scripture. For you cannot produce an evident Text, teaching that <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not begotten, God the Son is not made, but begotten by his Father onely, that the Holy Ghoſt is neither made nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten but proceedeth, and that both from the Father and the Son.</hi> And <hi>that God the Son is Conſubſtantial to his Father.</hi> Your anſwer to this is moſt highly unſatisfactorie. You ſay that <hi>although the matter of theſe points be not found</hi> in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis <hi>in Scripture, yet the ſenſe of them, according to equivalence, may as well as Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> To be as clearly ſet down as Tranſubſtantiation in Scripture, is (according to your own principles) not to be clearly ſet down at all. In your anſwer you were to ſhew that theſe points were clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40740:176"/> ſet down in Scripture, and you anſwer that they are as clearly ſet down as a point which is not clearly ſet down. Is this any way ſatisfactorie? Neither is it more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie if you mean to argue out of our own principles, for according to us, all points neceſſarie (and this point in particular) are not clearly ſet down in Scripture. And to prove this I have laboured all this Chapter. So that you neither ſatisfie according to your own nor our Principles. Your ſecond anſwer is deſtroyed by your former, for whileſt in that you profeſſe to hold theſe Articles, and not hold them upon the authoritie of the Church, you leave your ſelf no other authoritie, upon which you can hold them but onely ſuch Texts of Scripture as are not clear, and no more ſufficient to ground faith, then other places are to ground a belief of Tranſubſtantiation. Be ſuch places ſufficient?</p>
            <p n="61">61. For another neceſſarie point not plainly ſet down in Scripture, I urge Baptiſme of children,<note place="margin">Of my 16th. Number.</note> which is by no evident Text of Scripture taught us. You anſwer that it is not neceſſary for the ſalvation of the children to be baptized. And to prove this pernicious doctrine, you bring a Text which clearly ſpeaketh onely of men old enough to believe and deſire Baptiſme. For your Text is, <hi>He that believeth</hi> (he is then old enough to believe) <hi>and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not</hi> (and conſequently would poſitively not be baptized) <hi>ſhall be damned.</hi> This Text you ſee, ſpeaketh nothing of children, and whileſt it damneth thoſe who would not ſo much as believe, it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf to ſpeak of thoſe who would not be baptiſed, and theſe it damneth. How doth it then intimate that thoſe who are children, and could have onely baptiſme, <hi>in re,</hi> and not <hi>in voto,</hi> ſhould be ſaved without Baptiſme, for which point you bring it, and yet of this point it ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not at all; much leſſe doth it ſpeak as clearly as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other text ſpeaketh the quite contrary, to wit, <hi>Except a man be born of water and the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40740:177"/> of Heaven,</hi> Jo. 3. v. 5. Hear your own Doctor <hi>Tayler in his defence of Epiſcopacy,</hi> Sect. 19. P. 100. <hi>Baptiſme of Infants is of ordinary neceſsitie to all that ever cried, and yet the Church hath founded this Rite Rule upon the Tradition of the Apoſtles: And wiſe men</hi> (of whom I hope you are one) <hi>do eaſily obſerve that the Anabaptiſts can by the ſame probability of Scripture inforce a neceſsitie of communicating Infants upon us, as we doe of baptizing Infants upon them; Therefore a great Maſter of Geneva in a Book he writ againſt the Anabaptiſts was forced to flie to Apoſtolical traditional Ordination. They that deny this</hi> (Ordinarie neceſſitie of baptizing Infants) <hi>are by the juſt Anathema of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, confidently condemned for Heretickes:</hi> ſo he. This <hi>ordinary neceſsitie of Baptiſme to all that ever cried,</hi> You denie; <hi>Therefore by the juſt Anathema of the Catholick Church,</hi> you are condemned for an Heretick: yea you go further then the Pelagian Hereſie, for they were counted Hereticks (See Saint <hi>Auſt.

Hooker</hi> ſaith no leſſe in his 5. book of <hi>Eccleſiaſt. Policy</hi> 62. A number of other learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are againſt your Opinion. But I ſay leſſe of this point, for your own Opinion giveth me advantage enough to prove what I intend, that is, a point to be neceſſarie, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40740:177"/> yet not plainly ſet down in Scripture; if you grant <hi>that there is a Precept neceſſary to be fulfilled by Parents that they procure their Children to be baptized.</hi> But why God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this, the Children being as well ſaved without it (according to you) as with it, ſtill remains to be proved. I ſtand upon your grant of this Precept as neceſſarily to be fulfilled by the Parents. This Precept is neceſſary to be fulfilled. This Precept is not plainly ſet down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Therefore all neceſſarie points are not plainly ſet down in Scripture. Your anſwer will not here help you out, you ſay, <hi>Whatſoever is neceſſarily infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Scripture is binding in the Vertue of the Principle.</hi> But you cannot ſhew that this precept, given to the Parents, is neceſſarily inferred out of Scripture. Not out of the Inſtitution of our Saviour, for he alſo inſtituted the Euchariſt not neceſſarie for Infants not out of the ſubſtitution to Circumciſion, for ſo it ſhould not be nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſarie to women, no nor to any but thoſe of the Iewiſh Nation to whom onely Circumciſion was given as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie. Is this a neceſſarie Conſequence? <hi>Circumciſion was neceſſarie for the male children, Ergo Baptiſme is neceſſarie for male and female.</hi> You ſee it is not halfe true. Neither is that a neceſſarie Conſequence which is drawne from <hi>the baptiſing of whole families:</hi> for firſt, as we read whole families were baptized, ſo we read that whole families believed. So Iohn. 4. verſe 53. <hi>Himſelfe believed and his whole family.</hi> Will you hence evidently infer <hi>that the little Children under yeares of diſcretion alſo believed,</hi> as you infer that they are to be baptized by a neceſſarie precept. Again this illation is far from being evident, for it is not evident that there be litle ones in every family alive, and thoſe alſo under the age of diſcretion. In many families all the little ones that be alive are above ſeaven yeares old. There be many families of people newly married who have not yet any Children; There be many families of people who never had Children as thoſe who are barren,

            <p n="62">62. Now Sir, to conclude this long Chapter, I will ſhew that I conclude this point (and ſo I doe all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) juſt as you ſay I muſt conclude. For you ſay to me <hi>you muſt prove that thoſe points were and ought to be determined by the Church upon neceſſitie of Salvation.</hi> This I prove by this argument. This point and all the former are neceſſarie to be believed with an infallible aſſent. But we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any point with an infallible aſſent, unleſſe it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by an infallible authoritie; therefore we muſt find out an infallible authoritie which hath determined theſe points. The authoritie of the Scripture (as <hi>I</hi> have proved) hath not determined theſe points. We muſt therefore find out ſome other infallible authoritie upon whoſe determination we may be able to do, that which to be ſaved we muſt do, to wit, upon which we may be able to believe theſe points with an infallible aſſent: No ſuch infallible Authoritie can be found on Earth, if we deny the Authoritie of the Church to be infallible. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then that her Authoritie muſt needs be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <hi>The Fourth CHAPTER.</hi> The Church is this Judge. Her Authoritie Infallible.</head>
            <p>NO better beginning can I give to this Chapter,<note place="margin">Of my 17th. Number.</note> then the very laſt Number of the laſt Chapter, which I muſt intreat my reader to note moſt carefully, ſo to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the forcible deduction by which I prove the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a judge, different from Scripture, who muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible for the reaſon there aſſigned, and who can be no other then the Church. This proofe alone might ſerve the turn, yet I adde.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Firſt thoſe words <hi>Matthew</hi> 12.19 ſpoken to Saint <hi>Peter; vpon this Rock I will build my Church and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> theſe words allow the Church a ſecuritie from ever admitting any doctrin ſo pernitious that <hi>the gates of Hell may prevail againſt her.</hi> And this promiſe made to the Church is that which mainly makes to my purpoſe; Whether the church be built upon Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſors, or upon the faith of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> is not the thing I cheifly here aim at. <hi>My</hi> aim is to find <hi>a Church built on a Rock</hi> ſo ſtrong that no error ſhall ever overthrow it. And ſo I have nothing to do with your long diſputation about Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> I am now ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Church ſhall never be a <hi>Neſt of Errors, Idolatrous, ſuperſtitious, wickedly aſſuming the authoritie of an infallible tribunall without ſufficient warrant.</hi> All or any of theſe things would bring her to the gates of Hell, they being all damnable impieties. That, what is ſaid of this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church, only concerns the Roman Church, I will ſhew in the next Chapter. Have patience until then or read that firſt; You being to ſay nothing againſt me
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40740:179"/> untill you begin <hi>to ſay ſixthly, That you have enough againſt</hi> me for <hi>ſaying the Church is ſecured from all damnable errors</hi> by this promiſe. For this maketh you think my meaning to be, that Chriſt doth not intend here to exempt the Church from all error but only damnable. But Sir my meaning in ſpecifying her exemption <hi>from damnable errour</hi> was only that time to take for granted, that, which moſt of yours uſe to grant, and even thence to preſſe, your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you grant the Church free from damnable errour, whence I have at leaſt thus much <hi>that no body ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for following the guidance of the Church.</hi> And I have alſo that the whole Church, being thus by divine aſſiſtance ſecured from erring damnably, is ſecured from ever being deſtroyed by any damnable error, ſhe is therefore alwayes to have ſuch a viſible exiſtence as is neceſſarie to afford a guidance ſecured from erring damnable by it. Now by what Logick do you inferre that <hi>becauſe the Church is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from all damnable errour, therefore according to my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhee is not ſecured from other errours?</hi> All you build, upon this conſequence, falls to the ground. Going on I find you by the way quarelling with one of the Cardinall vertues, even Prudence her ſelf, which you intimate then only to have place, when Religion is choſen by intereſt. I pray do you thinke in earneſt that men cannot proceed prudently in the choiſe of their Religion? Then you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>that all the force my former argument hath it hath from Scripture.</hi> Is not my argument the better for this againſt you, who profeſſe to believe Scripture to be Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word, independently of the authority of the Church, becauſe it is clearly manifeſted to you, to be ſo by its light, as the Sun by his light. Is it not a convincing argument which is ſtrengthened with an authoritie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſo firme? Againſt a Heathen (untill I had proved Scripture to him) I would not uſe this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Preſently I find you again ſtumbling at the ſenſe in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40740:179"/> which I took the word <hi>damnable,</hi> as if I ſhould allow the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the Church in other errours. No Sir, you cannot follow her in other errors, becauſe ſhe cannot go before you in any errour; not in any damnable errour, as your own ſelves teach, no nor in any other errour as in this very next argument is proved, if you mark the force of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The force then of my next Argument is this, God commandeth us to obey the Church and hear her; in obeying her and hearing her, we follow Gods Command. But no kind of errour, little, or great, can be incurred, by following Gods Command, therefore we can be lead into no kind of errour by following the Church. Again you your ſelves ſay <hi>it is impoſsible to be obliged to aſſent to an errour, though it be not a damnable errour.</hi> Wherefore if I can prove that we are obliged to follow the Church, I ſhall prove alſo that ſhee cannot guide us into any kind of errour. This I prove by that text <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. verſe 18. <hi>If he will not hear the Church let him be unto thee as a publican or a Heathen,</hi> Therefore meerly, and purely, for not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, a man is to be held and truely, according to Gods judgment, deſerving to be held, a publican or Heathen: but all we are obliged not to deſerve to be held by Gods judgement, Publicans or heathens, Therefore all are obliged to hear the Church, being that meerly and purely for not hearing her, they are to be held, and deſervingly held, according to Gods judgment, Publicans and Heathens, as is alſo further inſinuated in the next verſe, where it is ſaid, this ſentence ſhall be ratified in Heaven. Now if any man reply that we are to heare the Church ſo long as ſhe ſwerveth not from Gods word; my anſwer is, that, to ſwerve from Gods word is to erre; but this text proveth ſhe cannot erre. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it proveth that ſhe cannot ſwerve from Gods word, and indeed, if ſhe could, the meerly not hearing her, could not deſerve, that a man ſhould deſerve to be accounted, according to Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Publican or Heathen. But you tell me <hi>this text is
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40740:180"/> to be underſtood, not of matters of faith or unbelief, but of matters of treſpaſſe between brother and brother, and refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs in the perſon. And that it reſpects excommunication by cenſure, in which alſo it may erre. Neither is a man bound to believe the cenſure is juſt, unleſs it appears to be ſo.</hi> This laſt aſſertion of yours is very extravagant doctrine, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous opinion of learned men is, <hi>That a man is bound to hold his ſuperiours cenſure or command to be juſt, unleſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears evident.</hi> See your own Doctors, <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> P. 308, N. 108. <hi>Hooker,</hi> P. 310, 311. N. 110. <hi>Laud,</hi> P. 226. And indeed you bring all to this, that, when all comes to all, you are the laſt judge, to whoſe ſentence finally all comes to be referred, and not to the ſentence of the Church, for you reſerve to your ſelfe the laſt judgement of her ſentence, <hi>to ſee whether it be juſt or no in your own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion.</hi> Sir, if the contrary be not evident, the Church (who is Superior) is to be followed, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If the contrary be evident it is impoſſible ſuch a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior as the Church is, aſſembled in a general Council ſhould not mark that evidence, without we will call that evident, or not evident, which is for our preſent turn to call evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or not evident. That which is truly evident will of it ſelfe appear to be ſo at leaſt to the moſt judicious, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and beſt inſtructed Prelates of the Church. And this is to be ſaid according to human Reaſon, although they had no infallible promiſe of a more then humane aſſiſtance, from the Holy Ghoſt. Moreover Sir, let us if you pleaſe, not paſſe ſo farre as the Cenſure, but let us make a ſtay in the mere conſideration only of the cauſe, for which the cenſure is given: that the cauſe is not hearing the Church; for this, and meerly for this only cauſe, according to the text, this man is (according to Gods judgement) deſervedly to be held as a Publican or Heathen; and therefore, if for this act of not hearing the Church, the cenſure cometh to be after wards pronounced againſt him, that cenſure will be made good in Heaven, as the next
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40740:180"/> verſe clearly ſaith; Wherefore it is impoſſible that this Cenſure ſhould be unjuſt, if he truly be guilty of not hearing the Church. It is true that a man may by falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or ſome ſuch way be judged to be guilty of not hearing the Church, when really he is not guilty, and ſo there may be an errour in the miſtake of the fact, and thus <hi>Clave errante</hi> in mater of fact, the ſentence will not be ratified in Heaven. But this is nothing to the purpoſe, for ſtill he, who is truly guilty of not hearing the Church, is for that only fact, and meerly for that cauſe, to be held deſervedly, according to Gods judgment, as a publican or Heathen. And ſo the Church cannot errour in denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Excommunication againſt ſuch a perſon. And hence you ſee how truely miſerable ſuch a perſon is, and how it muſt needs be damnable unto him not to heare the Church, which not to hear, maketh a man to be held as a Publican or Heathen moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, and according to Gods owne judgement. To hold himſelf not to deſerve this puniſhment, is to hold againſt Scripture. You highly wrong Saint <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> to ſay he heard not the Church, See my 9. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Theſe my Premiſſes being made good, it followeth clearly, that no man is ſecure in conſcience who will not obey the Church. And hence again it followeth that this Church cannot erre, at leaſt damnably, for elſe a Man might in Conſcience be bound to follow a damnable errour. No, ſhe cannot erre in an errour not damnable, becauſe alſo it very true which you lately ſaid, that ſo men ſhould be bound to aſſent unto an errour which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hence that common doctrine of Antiquity <hi>That it is not poſsible to have a juſt cauſe to ſeparate from the Church.</hi> And it cannot be ſaid that any man ſeparates himſelfe not from the Church, but her errours; being ſhe is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all errour; as appeareth manifeſtly by our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hear her; you tell me that <hi>this text,</hi> obliging to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40740:181"/> hear the Church, <hi>is meant onely of treſpaſſes betwixt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Brother, which treſpaſſes are alſo to be told to every particular Church and to Severall Prelates, and therefore this place, ſay you, maketh nothing for the authoritty of the Vniverſall Church.</hi> Sir, I grant particular treſpaſſes are to be referr'd ro particular Prelats, and that the Church is not to be called to a general Counſel, for every private mans treſpaſſes; ſingular private men are to be condemned by the particular Prelates of their particular Churches, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding according to the known Decrees and Orders of the Univerſal Church. If he clearly diſobeyeth them thus proceeding, he diſobeyeth the Univerſall Church. And for this act merely deſerveth, according to Gods own judgement, to be accounted as a Publican and Heathen. So he who diſobeyeth the particular Judge, judging according to the known Lawes of the Common-wealth, diſobeyes the Common-wealth. And it is this not obeying the Church, and the not hearing her, which exaggerates the crime, whence you ſee the not hearing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prelates, in ſo well ordered a Communitie as the Church is, may come to be commonly the ſelf ſame crime with the not hearing of the Church. And becauſe all ſuch Prelates (when the contrary is not apparently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt) are ſuppoſed to do their duty in giving ſentence according to the known Decrees, Orders and Canons of the Univerſal Church, as we uſually ſay, thoſe who diſobey the Judges diſobey the Commonwealth: ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, thoſe who diſobey the Prelates of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, diſobey the Univerſal Church, commanding them to proceed according to her Decrees, Definitions, and Canons. So that at laſt this diſobedience is againſt Chriſt, and God himſelf, according to that which God ſaid to <hi>Samuel,</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 8. <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me.</hi> And Chriſt to his Diſciples (the firſt Prelates of the Church.) <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And therefore Chriſt commanded the lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40740:181"/> of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be followed in what they delivered by publick authority, although they were wicked in their private lives, and many of them publickly did teach Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours though not by publick authoritie, or authorized by any Definition of that Seat, which private Errours Chriſt called <hi>the Leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> bidding his Apoſtles <hi>take heed of it;</hi> But concerning what that Seat did by publick Definition, Chriſt was ſo far from bidding people to take heed of it, that he in as general terms, as men ſpeak when they would ſpeak without any exception, <hi>Said to the whole promiſcuous multitude, and alſo to his diſciples; upon the Chair of</hi> Moſes <hi>have ſetten the Scribes &amp; Pharieſes. All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and doe;</hi> Mark theſe moſt ample words. <hi>All therefore whatſoever.</hi> O! will you ſay, what if they bid us do againſt the Scriptures; Why, this very ſaying of Chriſt ſheweth they were ſecured from ever doing againſt the Scripture when they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by way of defining with Publick authority. If you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that they condemned our Saviour by publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, you have your Anſwer Number 9. Say I we muſt hear the Church, and becauſe we muſt Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally hear her (for ſhe doubtleſs hath to the full as much reaſon to be heard as the old Iewiſh Church then had) ſhe muſt be confeſſed to have full aſſurance never to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay the Scripture. And as the Synagogues Authortity was not limited ſo as to be obeyed and heard onely in point of treſpaſſe betwixt Brother and Brother, but was to be extended to <hi>All whatſoever</hi> they ſhould order: So you can not (with out depreſſing the Authority of Chriſts Church <hi>who had a better Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes</hi> Hebrews 8.6.) hinder her power from being extended to <hi>All whatſoever</hi> ſhe ſhall Order. It muſt not therefore be confined only to treſpaſſe betwixt Brother and Brother; But we muſt of neceſſity, for the reaſon now expreſſed, argue thus, That being ſhe is to be heard, even in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies concerning treſpaſſes betwixt Brother and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40740:182"/> much more is ſhe to be heard in ſuch treſpaſſes as are committed by one Brother againſt all his Brothers and their deareſt Mother the Church. Then or never he is to be complained of, And if this obſtinacy in perſevering in treſpaſſes betwixt Brother and Brother deſerveth that a Man ſhould be held as a Publican and a Heathen, he incomparably more deſerveth to be held ſo, who being commanded by the Church to deſiſt from ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious opinions as ruine the Soules of his Brothers, and tear aſunder the bowells of his Mother, ſtill perſiſts in his impious doctrine, and in that moſt infectious, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murthring crime of hereſie the moſt heinous treſpaſs againſt all our Brothers. Either ſuch a crime or no crime is to be told the Church. Yea Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> calleth Schiſme (of which Hereſie is alwaies guilty) the higheſt ſin againſt the whole Comunity of our brother hood. Now this crime is to be told firſt to the particular Prelats as ſoon as it is perceivd to be begining to creep like a canker, as the Scripture ſaith Hereſie doth. If by this judgement of particular Prelats this crime be clearely found to be indeed Hereſie, or a doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine oppoſit to the known former definitions of the Church Univerſall, they are to excommunicate him who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious in this ſoul-murthering Crime, and this ſentence is ſure to be ratified in Heaven; becauſe he who hath oppoſed in Doctrine the known Definitions of the Church, hath not heard nor obeyed her, for which onely fact (according to the clear ſentence of Scripture) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly is to be accounted as a Publican or Heathen. Now if the Crime be not clearly againſt the known do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Univerſal Church, or not ſo evident againſt it, but many hold the contrary, the particular Prelates are bound to acquaint the head of the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. This ſupreme Prelate of the Church is bound to uſe the fulneſs of his authoritie to ſupreſſe the ariſing Hereſie. He may forbid (if he feareth danger in the doctrine) that no ſuch doctrine be publiſhed untill the Church ſhall
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40740:182"/> think it fit. And then all muſt doe as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. v. 27. <hi>Obey their Prelates.</hi> Thus far the power of the ſupreme Prelates is extended by the conſent of the whole Church. He therefore that in this caſe obeyeth not, is guilty of not bearing the Church, which ſingle crime maketh a man deſervedly accounted as a Publican or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> Now though the Supreme head of the Church be as infallible as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was, yet if he ſeeth this newly vented doctrine fit to be declared Hereſie, if it be ſo; or to be imbraced, if it be fitting, and propoſed to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then is the true time of calling a general Council, and not to let the people contend by allegations of Scripture. So though the Apoſtles were all infallible in their Doctrine yet they would not determine that grave queſtion <hi>Acts</hi> 15. without calling a Council <hi>To conſider of this word,</hi> in which there was made a great <hi>diſputation;</hi> for this is neceſſarie for the fuller conviction of Hereticks, fuller ſatisfaction of the weaker ſort, and further comfort of the whole Church, to ſee truth to triumph, upheld by the ſhoulders of all Chriſtendom; what proceeding could be more ſweet or more orderly; what expoſition more agreable to this Text, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> which denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation is to proceed by degrees from lower to higher Judges, as is there expreſſed. And Conſequently when the ſentence of the Higheſt tribunal of all is rejected, then or never, a man is deſervedly to be accounted a Publican or a Heathen for not hearing the Church univerſall. She therefore under ſo great a penalty being alwayes to be heard, is ſecured from all kind of errour what ſoever, in matters of faith belonging to her tribunall, and ſo we muſt grant her to be infallible. I have then already found out ſuch a judge, as I ſought for, a judge in matters of faith, a living judge, and infallible (as you would have him) <hi>wih an infallibility excluding all errour in what ſoever he propoſeth or decreeth, or all poſsibility of errour.</hi> For if it were poſſible for this judge to impoſe an errour, Chriſt
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40740:183"/> could not poſſibly have declared it to be ſo heinous a crime not, to hear the Church being that it might have been no crime at all. He obliged all to obey and hear her, ſhe therefore cannot lead us into an error. For as you truly ſay <hi>To be bound to aſſent to an errour is impoſsible.</hi> Our infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of knowledge concerning this point is as great as it is of thoſe points, which are delivered by Scripture. And therefore you may ſtand up to my Creed, and that far more ſecurely then ſtand out againſt ſuch a Church; the not hearing of which is ſo great a crime. This Church is infallible and by manifeſt conſequence only the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as I ſhall demonſtrate the next Chapter, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 2.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Here by the way you tell me, That <hi>If I would go the right way in this Diſpute, I ſhould uſe another method, for whereas I would argue the Church to be this Judge, which we cannot ſafely diſobey, I ſhould rather ſhew</hi> a priori, <hi>That the Church is infallible in whatſoever it doth define, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be obeyed in all things whatſoever.</hi> But Sir, when I come to uſe this very method, I do foreſee that it will ſo gald you, that you will cry out to have this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome, heavy argument caſt upon the other ſhoulder, from which you now would have it ſhifted, to avoid the preſent trouble it cauſeth you, you ſhall ſee if it fall not out as I ſaid, And that in this Chapter <hi>Numb.</hi> 52.</p>

            <p n="9">9. You fly upon me for flying to that Text of <hi>Malachy</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Prieſts Lips ſhall keep Knowledge, and they ſhall require the Law from his Mouth, becauſe he is the Angel of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Concerning the tranſlation of which Text, I truly charge your Bible of corruption for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, <hi>The Prieſts Lips ſhould keep the Law, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth,</hi> Whereas all Originals ſpeak clearly in the future tenſe, as the Hebrew doth,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40740:183"/> and alſo the Greek and Latin, which two Languages want not a ſubjunctive Mood; you ask, <hi>Is this Text meant of the Prieſts of Rome?</hi> I told you it was not. And I did ſay expreſly that I added this Text to take away from you all wondering at us, for allowing that to be practiſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Prieſts of the new Law (whoſe authority doubtleſſe excells thoſe of the old Law) which was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed towards the Prieſts of the old Law, in which thoſe who ſearched for the true knowledge of the Law, were not directed to ſeek that knowledge by their own reading the Scriptures, but they were to ſearch it by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Prieſts, who never (univerſally) ſhould fail at any time (mark that I ſpeak <hi>by univerſal conſent</hi>) to deliver falſe doctrine. As for private Prieſts they be like Private tranſlations of the word of God; If what they deliver agree with the doctrine of the Church, their doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is infallible; not for their private delivery of it, but for the authority of their Church, as Tranſlators are not to be believed for their authority but for their agreeing with the word of God. But there is a vaſt difference in this that the agreeing of the Tranſlation with the Original is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful hard to know, eſpecially when the Original it ſelfe cannot be known (by thoſe who admit of an infallible Church) by any infallible knowledge. The argument of the Prieſts with the Publick Doctrine of the Church, is eaſily known, becauſe her doctrine is ſo carefully publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt all underſtanding men. And as it is eaſy to know that <hi>Homo</hi> doth truly ſignifie <hi>a man,</hi> for though one ignorant or malitious Fellow ſhould ſay it ſignified a beaſt, yet the conſent of all others would manifeſt that mans perverſity. If a queſtion were propoſed in a matter of doubt in which their opinions varied, then men are to proceed as I juſt now declared Num. 9. And then when the cauſe ſhould be decided by the High Prieſts he who would not not hear him was deſervedly put to death <hi>Deutronomy.</hi> 17. I know you told me in another place that the Jewiſh
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40740:184"/> Church erred. I did deny it, why? Did not they erre in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning our Saviour. Yes, but then the Jewiſh Church erred not. The true high Prieſt (without whom there is no true Repreſentative Church) erred not <hi>Caiphas,</hi> was not the true High Prieſt for another was lawfully declared to be ſo. This other true High Prieſt was Chriſt, who before his condemnation had ſufficiently for a legall declaration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed himſelf to be the true Meſſias, the true Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our Lord. This true high Prieſt erred not: The true head of the Church not erring the Church cannot be ſaid to erre. The true head of the Church defined not with the Council of <hi>Ariminumt</hi> Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was bound to follow the Church defining, which defined not in that Council, for the Head of the Church not defining with the body, the whole body, or Church, defined not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay again you erre when you ſay, <hi>He ſhould have been bound in Conſcience by the cenſure of the Church to have been an Arrian. The</hi> Church, is the High Prieſt defining with a lawful general Council. The High Prieſt defining in a general Council erred not. I wonder you goe about alſo to juſtify the Tranſlators proceedings, becauſe who think the <hi>ſcope of the ſacred writer doth bear</hi> it. Is not this to give Tranſlators leave, together with their Tranſlation to obtrude their gloſſe, and what they imagin the <hi>ſcope ſhould</hi> be? Is this a ſound Tranſlation? Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> one of the beſt skilled in Hebrew and Greek of your Church, did according to his great skill, give a truer cenſure of your Tranſlation <hi>in his advertiſement of corruption to your Biſhops</hi> ſaying, <hi>That their publick Tranſlation of Scriptures into Engliſh is ſuch as it perverteth the Text of the old Teſtament in Eight hundred fourty eight places. And that it cauſeth Millions of Millions to reject the new Teſtament and to run to eternall flames.</hi> In what caſe then are they who take all that this Bible ſaith, for the undoubted word of God. When <hi>Tindal</hi> in the beginning of your Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tranſlated Gods Word into Engliſh, he did reform it ſo like one

Num. 3.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But to go on with my former diſcourſe I did ſay,<note place="margin">Of my 19th. Number.</note> 
               <hi>let any man aske the Prieſts of our Church what is the known doctrine of the Church and let him reſt ſecurely when he knows</hi> that. This you ſay is unreaſonable, becauſe the Prieſts are not infallible. But Sir, do you not marke that I ground their faith not upon the Prieſt but upon the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. Juſt as you ſay, you <hi>ground your faith not upon your Tranſlations</hi> which only conveigh (as the Prieſts doe) the word of God to the ſearcher of it; yet we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable more aſſurance of the agreement of what the Prieſts ſay to be the known doctrin of the Church, with the true doctrine of the Church; then you have of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your moſt corrupted (as we now ſhewed) Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, with the true Word of God, which I explicated more largely in the beginning of the laſt Number: whence you will ſee, that when by fallible men we know that this word <hi>Homo a man</hi> ſignifieth a man and not a beaſt, that when I find in Scripture tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God became <hi>Homo</hi> a man, I am infallibly aſſured he became a true man and not a beaſt Or a ſea-man; ſo when by fallible men we know aſſuredly enough to make it evidently credible that this is the doctrine of the Church, we are aſſured by the Church that is true. For the Church is infallible as I am here proving, and ſecured from all errour which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (to thoſe who rejects the Church) are not neither in their Tranſlations as I have here ſhewed, nor in their Original, as I ſhewed in the laſt chap Numb. 35. And again although you were ſecured of the true Scripture: yet you are not ſecured of the true ſenſe of it, as I ſhewed there Num. 50. And yet again a great many neceſſary Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies are not contained in Scripture, as I ſhewed in the<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40740:185"/> beginning and ending of that Chapter, which whoſoever ſhall read will wonder with what confidence you ask, <hi>well, and are not all things neceſſary taught in the Scripture?</hi> I have alſo ſhewed you it is falſe, that what Authority the Church hath it hath from the Scripture. ſee Chap. 3. N. 30. 31. 32. yea immediatly before thoſe places, I did (by eight arguments) ſhew that you have no infallible aſſurance of true Scripture if you deny the Churches infallibility. And whoſoever ſhall but conſider what I ſayd in the laſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will have a ready anſwer to your queſtion here <hi>Why</hi> doth <hi>your Church take away from the people the vſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Sir why doth your Engliſh Church in place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give them ſuch damnably corrupted Scriptures? Theſe Corruptions take indeed from them the uſe of Scripture, it being impoſſible for them to know what is uncorrupted, in ſuch a Chaos of corruptions. <hi>How miſerably do you provide for the poor people?</hi> In our manner of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that law from the Prieſts (which your own Tranſlation ſaith the people <hi>ſhould</hi> do) there is no more danger then in your taking the ſignification of a word in Scripture from the Publick conſent of all men. Again, we permit the uſe of Scripture in ſuch languages as a general council can judge of, becauſe they be ſufficiently underſtood by the Church Univerſal. Vulgar tranſlations are incomparably more eaſily corrupted and their Corruptions unknown unto her. The Latine language is known to moſt well bred men in learning, To ſuch others as are ſober, ſtayed, and peaceable ſpirits the Church denyeth not the uſe of ſuch Tranſlations as their lawful local Prelates hold ſecure. Farther uſe of Scripture is an abuſe and we both ſee and fell the ſad effects of it. You, who ſo carpt at going to the Prieſts of the Church <hi>for Knowledge of the law.</hi> You I ſay, if you mark it, ſend all your people to your own Prieſts, as you call them, neither rightly ordained, nor Canonically licenſed to preach. For to bid them go to the <hi>Engliſh Bible,</hi> is to bid them go to tranſlations moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40740:185"/> and authoriz'd only by your Miniſters. To confer theſe Tranſlations with the Originals they cannot do, no nor you neither. For you know not infallibly the true Originals. It is your own doctrine, <hi>Tranſlations are only known to be Gods word as far as they are known to agree with the Originals:</hi> how far this is, you (not knowing the true Original) cannot tell. Of this you and all yours (who deny the Church infallible) are ignorant. And upon your word, who (how learned ſo ever) are ignorant of this, which only concerns them, they all in this higheſt matter muſt rely. I put this ſo fully with great reflection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Noble party (whoſe Champion you are) gave occaſion to all our combating by carping at our blind obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Prieſt, and believing them, whereas all thoſe of your Religion could go to the fountain. But alas! when that fountain, which they conceive themſelves to drink to their eternal health is ſo poiſened (as I ſhewed in the laſt Number) <hi>that millions of millions</hi> (as your own <hi>Broughto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> ſaith) <hi>runne to Hell flames by occaſion of this corruption;</hi> And I may moſt truly ſay far more periſh by miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (whileſt they follow their Miniſters, and their own private judgement of diſcretion) that which is truly Tranſlated, then Periſh by the corruption of that which is falſly Tranſlated. Thus they periſh for not hearing that Church, which their own Scripture bids them heare, whereas in doing that, which God biddeth, there can be no danger of errour, great or little. And you ſlander us when you ſay we bid the people require from the Prieſts mouth not the law of God but the doctrine of the Church. Sir, the doctrine of the Church is Gods law. And private Prieſts are far more likely to teach them Gods law by teaching them what the Univerſal Church holds to be Gods Law, then by teaching them what they themſelves conceive to be Gods Law as you would have them do.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now to prove further the Church to be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judge guiding us no leſſe ſecurely then thoſe many
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40740:186"/> millions were guided who had an infallible faith, and the <hi>ſame Spirit of faith with us</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, though their faith were grounded on the authority of no Scripture, but wholy and intirely on the tradition of their infallible Church: I urged that in thoſe two thouſand years and more, before <hi>Moſes</hi> did write the very firſt book of Scripture, the true faith of all the true believers of thoſe Ages depended in its infallibility, upon their Churches being infallible in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the traditions ſhe had received; ſhall we allow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to that Church, and deny it to Chriſts Church? ſhall we be worſe provided for in ſo main a point in the law of grace, then they were in the law of Nature? what text of Scripture is there for this? Then it was not written. Hear the Church, then it was not written that the <hi>gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt</hi> her. Nor that <hi>ſhe was the Pillar and ground of truth,</hi> that the <hi>ſpirit of truth abided with her then, teaching her then all truth.</hi> All this and far more then this (as I ſhall ſhew in this chapter) is written now of Chriſts Church. And yet you will ſay we are not ſufficiently certified of her infalliblity. I pray tell me how then were they certified (and infallibly certified of the infallibility of their Church?) How did Men then infallibly know that they were bound under pain of damnation to believe the tradition of that Church? ſhew me then what you deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me laſtly to ſhew, that is <hi>ſhew the ground they had then to hold their Church infallible,</hi> and <hi>the infallibility of the knowledge of it, and infallibly what was the ſubject of this infallibility.</hi> If you cannot ſhew that they could not then do it better then we now, then refuſe not to ſtand up to our Creed. Your anſwer to ſo convincing an argument is moſt unſatisfactory, and it would make a man think your intent were to plead againſt your ſelf. You ſay this was <hi>anſwered before it was written,</hi> what was that anſwer? It was <hi>that the word in ſubſtance of it was before the Church, which was begotten by it;</hi> to this you add <hi>that when there is now as much need, and as great certainty of tradition as formerly, then I may urge this argument?</hi> ſo when you ſpeak of the word of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40740:186"/> God, which you ſay was before <hi>all writing,</hi> and <hi>which begot the Church,</hi> you muſt ſpeak of the unwritten word. This unwritten word is that very thing which we call tradition, and indeed when you ſpeak of ſuch a word as muſt be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for an exterior, and an infallible direction for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions, as were by it onely to be directed in the way of Salvation before any Scripture was written, you muſt of neceſſity put this word outwardly expreſſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and expreſſed in ſuch a manner as may be able to produce this effect of guiding whole millions in the way of Salvation by an infallible beliefe of what God hath ſaid by that word. Now I pray find me out any word of God any where exiſtent before Scripture, but in the Orall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church of thoſe times. You ſay, <hi>Gods word revealed is the ground of all faith.</hi> They then had faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they then had Gods word revealed, and revealed in a ſufficient manner to ground divine faith, But they only had Gods word revealed by Tradition, Therefore Gods word revealed by tradition is a ſufficient ground to ground divine faith. By this unwritten word, that is by this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, ſhe from a ſmall Church (conſiſting of thoſe very few, to whom God by his own mouth did firſt of all ſpeak, or by his Angels) grew to be a multitude of true believers. And ſo the Church was begotten by Tradition, upon which only this multitude (that is the Church) did judge moſt prudently that to be the true word of God which was by ſo powerfull a motive perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſo. That hence you may ſee, that, this very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive alone, is a very ſufficient inducement to receive the Verities recommended by it, and to receive them with an infallible aſſent. For this was the only inducement which we know the true believers to have had for thoſe 2000. years and more, which were before <hi>Moſes</hi> did write the firſt book of Scripture. And thoſe Scriptures which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the time of Chriſt, were only kept among the Iewes, and this time laſted two thouſand yeares more, during which long time many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40740:187"/> the Gentiles, as apeareth by <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, had true divine faith with out any knowledg of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wholy unknown unto them, this faith of theirs could have no other ground but Gods unwritten Word, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by Tradition; Therefore Gods unwritten Word, delivered by Tradition only, is a ſufficient ground for infallible faith.</p>
            <p n="12">12 And whereas you add, That <hi>when there is as much need and as great certainty of Traditions as formerly, then I may urge this argument,</hi> I anſwer, that the need or neceſſity of Traditions, which you conceive to have been greater then now, doth not make the Traditions more credible. Thoſe who have read very much in very many credible books of <hi>France;</hi> have no need at all of any unwritten and orall tradition to make them believe there is ſuch a countrey as <hi>France,</hi> yet theſe men (whom we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to live at <hi>Dover</hi>) doe as certainly know by unwritten or Orall Tradition of men daily coming from <hi>France,</hi> bringing <hi>French</hi> paſſengers, <hi>French</hi> commodities, and as to thoſe who never read one word concerning <hi>France,</hi> not being able to read at all. And thoſe who are not able to read at all, are not leſſe aſſured by unwritten tradition, that there is ſuch a Kingdome as <hi>France,</hi> becauſe there be many books written of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> warrs with the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> So though we have now the Scriptures written concerning moſt points of faith; we are not leſſe helped by tradition becauſe there be ſuch books extant. And good Sir, conſider how great our neceſſities are of both theſe helps; for even now when we have Scriptures and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we have ever had with them a perpetuall ſucceſſion of horrible diviſions opening ſtill wider and wider; All commonly cauſed by the miſinterpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to which inconvenience they were not ſubject before all Scripture was written. And therefore, in this reſpect there is now after the writing of the Scripture, a greater neceſſity then ever of Tradition, both to aſſure us which
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40740:187"/> books be the word of God, which not, which be the true which the falſe Copies of theſe books? Where they be ſecure, where corrupted? And laſtly which is the true ſenſe of them and which not? For the ſenſe even in neceſſary matters, as I have ſhewed in the laſt Chapter, is far from being evident. Again Tradition doth of its own ſelfe naturally continue in its full force and vigour, after the ſame things are wrirten as well as it did before, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what I juſt now ſaid of the unwritten traditions by which many men only know <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> yea rather, the increaſing of it (by being divulged in writing by moſt credible and manifold Authors) doth very much ſtrengthen this former tradition, ſo far is it from taking any thing from it: wherefore God muſt purpoſely by a miracle have infringed the courſe of Nature (which no man can ſay he did) if the former Traditions of the Church (which before the writing of any Scripture did fully ſuffice alone to ground an infallible faith of ſuch and ſuch points, ſhould grow then to loſe their ſufficiency in order to the ſame effect, when they were ſtrengthned by ſo great an authority as that of the Sacred Writers was. Hence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the opinion of Proteſtants, teaching the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Traditions to have expired when the whole Canon of the Scripture was finiſhed, though not before: For which they have no Scripture at all. And if they go by reaſon, they are to ſay Tradition was rather more ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea if they will not ſay this, yet conſequently they ſhould ſay that Tradition revived againe (at leaſt in part) when ſome part of the Canon was loſt, yet you ought not to ſay that Tradition expired at the finiſhing of the Canon, without it can be ſhewed that God did expreſſe this unto the Church ſo to undeceive thoſe many thouſands who had then reaſon to think that they might ſecurely build their beliefe upon that, upon which for about foure thouſand yeares, ſo many had untill that day built their faith. When Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other Canonical writer
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40740:188"/> preached firſt that doctrine, which afterward he did write, did the beliefe of thoſe thouſands which was at firſt ſufficiently grounded upon his preaching, come to loſe its certainty, or rather to gain a new degree of certainty, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> came afterward to write <hi>that they muſt hold the Traditions he had delivered to them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 1 Gal. 2.</note> and <hi>that though an Angel ſhould come and teach them contrary to what they had received (by his Orall Tradition) they ſhould account him Anathema.</hi> And again, <hi>Have thou a form of ſound words which thou haſt heard of me</hi> 1. Tim. chap. 1. And again chap. 2. <hi>the things which thou haſt heard</hi> (he ſaith not, read) of me by many <hi>witneſſes, theſe commend to faithfull men which ſhall be fit to teach others alſo.</hi> Would the writing of ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make them think any force taken from Traditions, or rather make them conceive that Traditions are to be ſtood upon now more then ever before. Again, what wiſe man would put out one light, coſting him nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be ſhining of its own nature (unleſſe you will needs have it hidden) becauſe he hath now another light, but ſo that even with both theſe lights, many of his houſe-hold will ſtill remain in darkneſs. But if you ſay <hi>that if Scripture had not been given us we ſhould have had a more certain Tradition given unto us,</hi> I would know of you upon what account the Tradition of ſo Noble a Church as Chriſts Church is, ſhould be of leſſe credit or certainty, then the Tradition of that farre leſſe Noble Church which was in the Law of Nature. What meanes had they then given by God to ſecure their Tradition for the ſpace of 4000. years, which we want for the having ſecured our Traditions for theſe laſt 1654. yeares? This meanes you can by no means aſſigne, and therefore, by all means, you muſt grant the Traditions of this Nobler Church to have been as ſecurely preſerved from Corruption for theſe fewer yeares, as thoſe Traditions of a farre leſſe Noble Church, were preſerved without corruption for above 4000 yeares. Again the Tradition of Chriſts primitive
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40740:188"/> Church before the Scriptures were written, and ſufficiently promulged (which Tradition did by an infallible authority recommend all things) was to be believed upon her ſole authority, and ſo was the Tradition of the firſt Church before there was any Scripture, and therefore by good conſequence ſhe in the firſt place reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended herauthority to be believed as divine and infallible, and all the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers believed it to be ſo, which they could not have done without God had ſaid ſo; for all divine beliefe reſteth upon the ſaying of God. God therefore ſaid (by that his Church) that her Traditions were infallible for her authority. Now if God ſaid this, ſhall we upon your fallible diſcourſe come to ſay the Church's Traditions are now no longer infallible though God ſaid they were ſo, and never yet expreſſed the ceaſing of their infallibility. By this you will ſee whether my Anſwer hath helped you, or your reply helped me concerning what will follow out of St. <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. For this ſerves for making good what I ſaid out of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſo farre as he is a witneſs (which a profane author might have been) of what hapned ſo near his times. For as for his authority, as he is a moſt grave Father of the Church and a moſt believing that to be true which he commended to writing as moſt true, I doe not preſſe it againſt you. Yet becauſe here you thank St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> for his teſtimony, and make a ſhew as if it were for you (though you cannot invent the means by which Tradition ſhould have ben conveighed more certainly ſuppoſing there had been no Scripture), I could not but obſerve how ſo ſoon as you have hugged him, you caſt him off again with ſmall reſpect, when you ſay <hi>Neither can we believe that thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations did rely only upon Tradition, They might be commended to the doctrine of the Goſpel by Tradition and then not believe it for the ſake of Tradition.</hi> How flatly be theſe your words againſt St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who clearly declareth all himſelfe to tell us upon what ground <hi>we muſt have been
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40740:189"/> obliged to believe, though the Apoſtles had never written any Scriptures at all: What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the Apoſtles had not left us the Scriptures, muſt we not have followed that order of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which they delivered to thoſe, to whoſe Charges they left the Church to be governed? To this order of tradition by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word many barbarous Nations do aſſent, who have believed in Chriſt without any writings, keeping diligently the ancient Traditions.</hi> What bringeth he this example of theſe Barbarous Nations for, but to ſhew that we might with divine faith believe upon the ſole account of that very tradition which the Apoſtles <hi>de facto</hi> left to thoſe to whom they left the Churches goverment, <hi>although the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had never written at all at any time?</hi> He therefore was none of thoſe who would ſay with you <hi>neither can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thoſe barbarous Nations did rely only upon traditions;</hi> For if they had relied upon any things elſe in their beliefe, their example had bin nothing to his purpoſe to ſhew what we ſhould have done when we had only Tradition to rely upon.</p>
            <p n="14">14. As for arguing about Tradition I went no Further then to ſhew, that the Tradition of the Church teſtifying her own infallibility (in propoſing for Gods word that which ſhe delivereth us (for Gods Word) as worthy of an infallible aſſent in this point. And the examples I bring, prove this. Now if this point be once aſſented unto with an infallible aſſent, it draweth by unevitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the like aſſent to all other points, which by the ſame authority are teſtified to be likewiſe delivered as Gods Word; Or elſe you muſt be forced to ſay that it is in our power to aſſent to this authority as divine in all things it delivers as Gods Word, and yet to deny it in ſome things which it delivers as Gods word, which is a plain contradiction. Well then if upon this preſuppoſed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as infallible, I believe the Church delivering ſuch and ſuch points by her doctors and teachers, which be points never written; then it is manifeſt I believe her in other
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40740:189"/> points then thoſe which were then written; &amp; ſo I may with as good reaſon believe her now upon her own authority, teſtifying other points then thoſe which are written. Whence you ſee all I ſay holdeth good <hi>even in Traditions of proper name which we ſay are beſides that which is written. I</hi> cannot conclude more oppoſite to you then with your own words here <hi>P.</hi> 73. <hi>Tradition in matters of faith unwritten is of equall authority to scripture.</hi> The Traditions we ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be matters of faith truly once revealed by our Saviour or his Apoſtles, though this revelation were not written by them; Therefore this is of equall authority to Scripture even according to your own words.</p>
            <p n="15">15 I going on to prove yet further that Chriſt intended to guide us not by the Scripture only, but cheifly by his Church, uſed this argument <hi>Neither the Apoſtles nor their Succeſſors took any care to have the Scripture communicated to all Nations in ſuch languages as all, or the greater part of them could underſtand. You</hi> anſwer; <hi>they did take care that the new Teſtament ſhould be written in Greek.</hi> Then you being ſtill to prove that Greek was underſtood by all, or the greater part of the world, your only proof of this is only out of <hi>Tully;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Graeca per totum Orbem leguntur,</hi> Greek is read though the whole World, and ſo is <hi>Virgil</hi> in latin. But neither the one nor the other is to be underſtood in a ſenſe making to our purpoſe; for both theſe ſayings are only true thus, that the more learned ſort of men every where read Greek, and <hi>Virgil.</hi> And theſe words of <hi>Tully</hi> being delivered in on Encomiaſticall Oration <hi>(pro Archia)</hi> may truely be ſaid to be ſpoken by way of a Notable amplification. And either this muſt be confeſſed, or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture denied. For it is evident out of Scripture. That the Vulgar language of diverſe Nations ſituated, even between that place we call <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Citty of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> in which a man would ſuppoſe the <hi>Greek language</hi> farre more common, then in the more Weſtern or any <hi>Northern,</hi> or Southern places, yet I ſay even between thoſe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40740:190"/> two Cities of <hi>Antioch</hi> (where the ſame <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, <hi>Archias</hi> was born and ſtudied) and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue was not the Vulgar language <hi>of Pontus, Cappadocia, Aſia</hi> minor, <hi>Phrygia, Pamphilia,</hi> all which Nations the Scripture (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.) teſtifieth to have had different languages. Within that compaſſe is alſo <hi>Galatia</hi> which <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> teſtifieth to have had a language ſomewhat like thoſe of <hi>Trevers.</hi> If nations ſo neere <hi>Greece</hi> had not the Vulgar uſe of that language, but that tongue had ſo ſmall a compaſſe even <hi>in Aſia,</hi> and ſome few <hi>Eaſtern parts of Europe,</hi> all other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and whole <hi>Africa</hi> uſing Vulgarly other Tongues, how ſhort do you fall of proving that Greek was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the greater part of the World? And if this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, then I ſaid truly that though the <hi>Apoſtles writ the new Teſtament in Greek, yet they did not take any care to have it communicated to all Nations in ſuch Languages, as they could all, or the greater part underſtand.</hi> For all, or the greater part could not underſtand Greek; call here to mind how lowd you uſe to cry out againſt us for uſing our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer in Lattin, though Lattin be ſo common among all well bred people. And yet our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer is a thing only offered to God by the Prieſts (who underſtand what they ſay) for the people. But the New Teſtament contains (as you ſay) the only neceſſary grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of faith, faith neceſſary to ſalvation. But the falſity of this your ſaying is convinced by the Apoſtles taking no care (neither read we of any care taken for many yeares after their times) to communicate the whole Canon of Scripture to the ſeverall converted Nations in their ſeveral tongues; I pray name me the time when the Scripture can be firſt ſhewed to have bin thus communicated to the people of ſo ſeverall languages? You will ſweat for ſome hundred yeares before you can find this either done or effectually deſired to be done. They know the tongue could ſufficiently deliver Gods Word to the people, and that Orall Tradition joyned to dayly profeſſion, practiſe would abundantly ſuffice for the infallible delivery of Gods Word.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:40740:190"/>16. You move the queſtion <hi>how the people ſhould clearly know the true tradition from the falſe?</hi> I anſwer <hi>firſt</hi> they could know this better then know true Scripture from falſe, for they could not do that, but by knowing firſt the true Tradition recommending the true Scriptures from the Tradition recommending falſe. <hi>Again,</hi> after Chriſt they could do this as well (and better) then their forefathers for many hundreds of years, yea for two thouſand, yea for twice two thouſand yeares together. Reflect a little upon the efficacy of Tradition, joyned with perpetual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and anſwerable practice dayly occurring. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The Apoſtles by onely unwriting Tradition did clearly, undeniably teach the <hi>baptizing of Children, prayer for the faithfull departed.</hi> This Tradition from hence came to be Profeſſed as true doctrine by all the firſt Chriſtians, and conformably hereunto, they in all places bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed their Children, in all places they prayed for the faithfull departed. Nothing more common then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born: every one that is born dieth: whence dayly was the practice of baptizing infants and yet more dayly the practice of praying for the dead, becauſe they baptize infants but once, but they pray often for the ſame man who is dead. Will we ſuppoſe theſe two traditions are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion concerning the truth of them. And let us ſuppoſe this to be done (as it was done) in the laſt age. Learned men looking in Records of their own and all other Countries, will find every where Chriſtnings, and every where prayers for the dead, all inſcriptions of graves, all wills and teſtaments, all foundations of pious places will teſtifie this cuſtome farre more ſtrongly then that of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, yea in no one countrey nor in any one age ſince Chriſt (untill this laſt following age) did ever any one man deny praying for the dead, except <hi>Aerius</hi> counted for this his opinion an <hi>Heretick</hi> by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and by St. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> as you know very well. Hence it is made evidently credible to any learned man that this Tradition of baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants, and much more the Tradition of praying for
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40740:191"/> the dead, came to us from the Apoſtles, it not being poſſible for all true believers, in ſo many ſeverall countries, and ſo many ſeverall ages, to agree in the profeſſion and daily practice of this truth, without they had received theſe two things joyntly with their firſt faith, elſe the novelty and the authors of ſuch a novelty, would in ſome time or ſome place, have been made known to poſterity, for no one mans worke was it, no, nor no one hundred mens worke, to bring all men, every where, to any ſuch novelty with ſo unanimous, and no where contradicted conſent. The Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people will have the truth of theſe Traditions alſo made evidently credible unto them by the publick, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous and univerſal conſent of all antient men and all Ancient Monuments and alſo the like unanimous affirmation of all learned men of any ſtanding, who will all and every where profeſs themſelves aſſured of it, by their Learning and certain knowledge of thoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions proved in the manner I now ſaid. This maketh the matter evidently credible to the ignorant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould do moſt imprudently not to believe that theſe points came from the Apoſtles, and then ſuppoſing that they came from them, they ſhould do a damnable ſin not to believe them. Can any rationall man deſire a more rational proceeding? How many true believers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Scripture, cannot give ſo prudent a reaſon for what they believed? How we proceeding thus eſcape clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Circle I told you the laſt Chapter. Numb. 31.32. Now as you muſt grant that our Church (ſubmitted unto as infallible) preſently by her authority decides all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies; ſo her Traditions once acknowledged as infallible, will decide the points queſtioned. The Scripture never ſo clear can never decide any one controverſie untill it be firſt acknowledged. Thus you ſee the two things which you here deſired to ſee.</p>
            <p n="17">17. After this I paſſed to another quality which the Church hath, and the Bible hath not, though it be a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40740:191"/> primely neceſſary to decide all controverſies, whence it appeareth that God intended not the Bible but the Church to be our judge. This quality is, that the Church is a living judge who can be informed of all Controverſies ariſing from time to time, and who can heare me and you, and be heard by me &amp; you ſo manifeſtly, that neither I nor you can doubt of the true meaning of this Church, or if we do doubt we can propoſe our doubts and ſhe will expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, her meaning. Such a living judge as this we muſt have to put effectually an End to all Controverſies that can ariſe. And as for the Bible I have ſhewed that it doth not decide all points neceſſary to Salvation, the Bible heareth not new Controverſies ariſing, as I prove by this clear example. An <hi>Arrian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eth up (as really he did) and ſaith that theſe words of the Scripture, <hi>Theſe three are one</hi> are words added by us to the true Scripture. This Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie and a thouſand ſuch like the Bible heareth not, the Bible judgeth not, for there is not a word of it in all the Bible. And though you ſay you can ſee true Scripture by its light, you ſhall never get any man to believe that you your ſelfe do really believe that you ſee every verſe in Scripture, by its light. No light appeareth ſo dimm as theſe words appear to man. <hi>Three are one.</hi> Yet beſides this light you (who reject Church Tradition as fallible) you I ſay, have left you no other infallible ground, nor any infallible meanes to convince the Arrian, untill you hold the Church infallible. All other uſe which you ſay you make of the (Church) ſufficeth not to ground an infallible aſſent, for when all comes to all, you make any private man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently every Arrian Cobler (as I ſhewed) the laſt Court of Judicature in giving the finall ſentence, on which all depends. For he muſt be the laſt judge, who after the Churches judgement, muſt give ſentence that ſhe hath, or hath not judged againſt Scripture. That you may ſee my argument is not peccant; I will frame both the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes and the Concluſion thus. Faith being an infallible
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40740:192"/> aſſent, Controverſies concerning faith cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſo as to end then effectually, but by an infallible living judge who can heare you and me, and be heard by you and me. But no other then the Church, can (with any ground) be held to be this living judge; Therefore She muſt be held to be this judge. I doe not without Reaſon put in my Premiſſes the terme of infallible, for faith being an infallible aſſent, muſt needs require an infallible authority to reſt upon. This Authority ſhe muſt find in all points to which ſhe is bound to give this aſſent. But ſhe is bound to give this aſſent to diverſe points not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed clearly in Scripture as I ſhewed the laſt Chapter. Therefore ſhe is bound to give this aſſent to diverſe of thoſe points onely, becauſe they are propoſed by the Church, to which ſhe could not poſſibly be bound to give an infallible aſſent, without due aſſurance of her infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</p>
            <p n="48">48 You object that the Church Traditions cannot hear you and me. I anſwer that it is the Church who propoſeth theſe Traditions, and not the Traditions which are our judge; you aſk me whither <hi>an Heretike be not condemned by himſelfe</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, and you interpret his ſaying, ſo that he muſt needs be condemned by himſelfe, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, but becauſe he had in him the principles of the word of God, which he gain-ſaid by his contrary error, and ſo he was condemned thereby, and therefore that can Judge. Sir he is not an <hi>Heretike</hi> but an infidel who is told by his own Conſcience, that he gain-ſaith the Scripture. All chriſtians are readier to die then to diſbelieve any one ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ thoſe words, the whole Canon of the Scripture was not written, and until the whole Canon was written your own Doctors grant the Church to have ben the infallible judge of Controverſies. And I wonder you ſhould ſay, <hi>the Church at the writing of this by St. Paul was not ſufficiently formed,</hi> which the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth to have been formed before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, accuſing himſelfe for having <hi>above meaſure perſecuted
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40740:192"/> the Church of God.</hi> And before his converſion, <hi>the Number of the diſciples was multiplied,</hi> Act. 6. yea Act. 8. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was turned <hi>Heretick</hi> before St. <hi>Paul</hi> was turned Chriſtian, or any word of the new Scripture was writen. The meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is that an <hi>Heretick</hi> might, if he would, clearly ſee his private doctrine to be oppoſite to the known publick Doctrine of the Church, which Church then ſhined with the glory of infinite Miracles, ſtupendious converſions, and moſt eminent Sanctity, and was then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med moſt completely with all things neceſſary to infallible direction to the true faith. Yea you will ſay ſhe was then more completely furniſhed to that end then ever ſhe was ſince that time.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Now becauſe your cheif exception againſt the Churches being our judge, is that you hold her not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beſides all the proofs I have already brought of her infallibility, I ſhall now add divers more. But in the firſt place I muſt a little more fully tell you what we underſtand by the name of the Church: He who is a ſeeker of his Religion muſt firſt believe the Univerſal Church diffuſed to be furniſhed by God with true infallible meanes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us ſecurely in all doubts of faith, wherefore he moſt prudently judgeth himſelfe bound to joyne himſelfe to her in faith, being convinced that ſhe directed moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in faith. Being thus alſo a ſeeker reſolved to ioyne to theſe true believers. When he proceedeth further to take a particular account in whom this infallible meanes (given to the Church Univerſal) of directing all ſecurely in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith doth conſiſt, he will readily find that it doth not conſiſt in all the members of the Univerſal Church, for Children and women be of the Church, and yet their Vote (in no mans opinion) is required to the deciding any controverſie in faith, the Laiety alſo hath no deciſive Voice in thoſe points, nor every inferiour Clergy man, but only ſuch as are Prelates, Overſeers and Governors over the reſt. So that in fine this infallible direction is Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40740:193"/> affirmed by us all, to be undoubtedly ſettled upon the authority of the prime Paſtors &amp; Prelats of the Church aſſembled together in a lawfull generall Councell, with their cheife Paſtor and Head the Biſhop of Rome: Againſt a thing ſo eaſily to be underſtood you cry out aloud of ſtrange intricateneſſe and inextricable proceedings. And yet I think moſt clowns of this Land did eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what was meant by a decree of the Kingdome, to the which the conſent of King and Kingdome aſſembled in Parliament (as the cuſtome was for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was required. Now what more difficulty is there to know what we meane by a decree, or Definition of the Church; The kingdome repreſentative was the king and the Parliament, The Church repreſentative is the cheife Biſhop with the full Aſſembly of the other Biſhops in a lawful Council; the Decrees, and definitions of which aſſembly be the decrees and definition of the Church. In a thing ſo cleare you labour your uttermoſt to raiſe a thick miſt.</p>
            <p n="50">50. Firſt you obiect <hi>who can be certain by a divine faith of the lawfulnes and Regularity of a Pope in his firſt creation.</hi> I anſwer that when I ſpeake of a Pope defining in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Councel (as I do now ſpeak) I ſpeak of ſuch a Pope to whom the Church ſubmitted in calling the Councel, and whom the Church admitteth as her lawful head to preſide in the Councel, Theſe very acts ſupply all defects in his election and do make it <hi>evidently credible</hi> that he is the true head who thus admitted defined with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel as their acknowledged head. <hi>Secondly</hi> you aſk <hi>when there was Pope againſt Pope, who of the people could diſtinguiſh the right Pope.</hi> I anſwer, that he ſhall ever be eſteemed the right Pope to whom the Prelates of the Church ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly obey, when he calleth them to meet in a general Councel, and in this Councel to preſide over them. To to have two ſuch Popes, as theſe are, at one time is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And this is the only time in which a Pope defineth with
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40740:193"/> a lawful Councel. What you ſay of Popes not defining in ſuch a Councel is not our Caſe put me a Pope defining with a lawful Councel and then prove him fallible if you can. Whether the Popes definitions out of a Councel be fallible or infallible maketh nothing to this purpoſe. Only this is evident if they be infallible out of a Councel, they be infallible in a Councel. <hi>Thirdly</hi> you think that no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies <hi>can (in</hi> our opinion) be <hi>decided when there is a doubt who is true Pope.</hi> And you aſk <hi>who is then to call a Councel.</hi> And when the Councel is called you think us to think that this Councel can define nothing without a Pope. I doubt not Sir but you have found a clear anſwer to all this in <hi>Bellarm lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Concilis Chap.</hi> 19. that although a Councel without a Pope cannot define any article of faith, yet in time of ſchiſme it can judge which is true Pope, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Church of a true Paſtor if ſhe had none, who thus provided by the Councels authority, may diſſolve the Councel if he pleaſeth or if he pleaſe to have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine aſſembled, they remaine ſo now by his authority, and can define as well as other Councels called by the Pope. In that meeting in which the Pope was to be choſen, or declared the undoubted Pope, the Prelats of the Church might and ought to meet upon their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and aſſemble themſelves. <hi>Fourthly you aſk how we can by divine faith come to be aſſured of the lawfulnes and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Councels, for Councels have been called by Emperours not by Popes;</hi> Sir your Church which never had, nor ſhall have generall Councel, is to ſeeke in all things belonging to them. Our Church almoſt in every age ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> hath been viſibly aſſembled in general Councels, and by perpetual practice hath been ſufficiently informed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver (by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt) all that ſhe hath received from her anceſtors to be eſſential to a true Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and to deliver this point infallibly. To your obiection in order I anſwer, <hi>firſt,</hi> That it is out of Scripture evident that there is no divine inſtitution by which either Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40740:194"/> be aſſured to be ſtill found in the world, or that, when they have that dignity, they be by divine inſtitution inveſted with a power to call Councels. We ſeek for this divine Inſtitution. This we will not admit until it can be ſhewed in Scripture or Tradition, the fact of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſheweth not divine Inſtitution. <hi>Secondly</hi> as for the Prelates of the Church we can ſhew divine Inſtitution, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Biſhops placed by the Holy Ghoſt over all the flock to feed or govern the Church of God.</hi> And 4. Epho. Not lay Magiſtrates but only Eccleſiaſtical are ſaid to <hi>be given us by Chriſt, for the work of the Miniſtery for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, that henceforth we may not be carried about with every wind of doctrine</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Emperour, is not by divine Inſtitution Lord of the Chriſtian world. No nor of any conſiderable part of it. Wherefore ſeeing that a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power is no motive power any further then it can, or ought to be able to motive, the Emperiall power, which cannot move further then it reigneth, nor ought not to move further, cannot conſequently command any further then his territory at the uttermoſt. The power of the cheife Paſtor of the Univerſal Church is coextended to the Univerſal Church. All Biſhops of the Univerſal being to be moved, muſt be moved by ſuch a power as this is. If Emperours called councils it was not by an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical calling, ſuch an one as the Pope called them by at the very ſelfe ſame time, but the Emperours calling was only political, proceeding from a temporal power, ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Eccleſiaſtical, and not able to force them by cenſure in caſe of refuſing to come, as the Eccleſiaſtical power could, which power implored the Emperiall aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to concurre with her, only for the more effectual excution. Perhaps ſomtimes Emperours might venture to call, dependently of the ratification of the ſupreme Paſtor which they preſumed would be aſſuredly obtained in ſo juſt neceſſities as there ſeemed to preſſe for a ſpeedy meeting. If Emperors were preſent in Councels it was only
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:40740:194"/> by their preſence and good countenance to honor, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and further the proceedings of the Councel, and to paſſe their Vote in points of beliefe. You add ſomething elſe now but it comes again preſently. <hi>Fifthly</hi> you object, <hi>How ſhall we know that every one of the Councel hath a free election to it, and a free deciſive Vote in it?</hi> I anſwer the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of every mans calling is made evidently credible by the publick ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons ſent through the whole Chriſtian world obeyed by the ſame without any pertinatious oppoſition, and the anſwerable publick apperance from all parts of the world every one exhibiting the publickely authenticated teſtimony of his election, and confirmation. If any man be excluded he may (without he will renounce his right) be heard in the Councel, which being a publick hearing, the matter cannot but be known. Many yet never were, nor can be thus injured without making their injury noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by publik proteſtations and ſuch lik remedies alwayes uſed againſt unjuſt excluſion, or hinderance of liberty in Voting. If the Councel be known notoriouſly to uſe ſuch procedings we are not to acknowledg it for a lawfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. Again as private mens proceedings are not to be judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bad unleſs they can be proved to be ſo, much leſſe ought the proceedings of the Church repreſentative to be judged bad without ſufficient proof of the contrary. And when ſuch evident and notorious ill proceedings are not apparent, nothing can be ſolidly objected againſt the lawfulneſs of the Councel. And therefore it being to be admitted as a lawfull Councel, it belongeth to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to provide that their difinitions be not prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the Church put under his protection, and direction. You only look what the inward nature of humane malice might act, but you ſhould alſo look to the extrinſical over-ruling providence promiſed by God againſt humane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and weakneſs. This is that which maketh all theſe factions, and bandings, and domineering ſelf intereſt never to be effectually deſtructive of that ſecure direction
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:40740:195"/> promiſed by God to his Church. Though hell gates ſhould be ſet wide open they ſhould not prevaile againſt her. <hi>Sixthly</hi> you ask <hi>how ſhall ignorant people be divinely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Councel is general?</hi> I anſwer, the publick Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Councel ſent through the Chriſtian world, The Publick appearance of Prelats made upon theſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from all parts of the world, Their publick ſitting, publick ſubſcribing, publick divulging their decrees and definitions, acknowledged truly to be theirs by all preſent, denied by no man to be theirs with the leaſt ſhew of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, no more then ſuch an Act is denied to be the Act of ſuch a Parliament. All theſe motives, I ſay, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it <hi>evidently credible</hi> to the ignorant and to the learned that this is the true definition of the Church. Now this being <hi>evidently credible</hi> to be her definition, and I believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by divine faith, all her definitions to be true. I alſo believe this definition amongſt the reſt to be true. It is a great ſigne you are ill furniſhed with ſtrong arguments, when you would perſwade us that in things ſo eaſy to be known there be ſuch inſuperable difficulties. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trents</hi> definitions concerning faith were never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>France,</hi> though ſome things ordained for practice ſeemed leſſe ſutable to the particular ſtate of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet this difficulty was at laſt removed. <hi>Seventhly</hi> you ask <hi>how many Biſhops in the Trent Councel were furniſhed with a title to over-power the reſt for the Popes ends.</hi> I pray Sir, tell me how many. But tell me by credible witneſſes (ſuch as are their own ſubſcriptions) who can aſſure me of this truth; And when you have told me this, give me leave to aske what one of them was as much as ſuſpected to be of a faith different from the reſt. If they differed not in faith from the reſt, how then can the Pope be ſuſpected to have acted againſt faith by making ſuch Biſhops. Again doth the making of ſuch Biſhops make the holy Ghoſt unable to order things ſo in the councel that nothing ſhall happen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the ſecure direction undertaken to be afforded
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40740:195"/> for ever by him. <hi>Saul</hi> ſhall ſooner turn a Prophet, and <hi>Caiphas</hi> ſhall prophecie not knowing what he doth, before the ſpirit of truth, ſent to teach the Church all truth, ſhall faile in his duty. <hi>Eightly</hi> you ask <hi>how the Church was provided for when for ſo many yeares there was no Pope defining with a Councel?</hi> This time you mean was the firſt three hundred years after Chriſt, when for perſecution no Council could be gathered. All this time the known doctrine of the Apoſtles remained ſo freſh, and ſo notorious by the Tradition of the Church diffuſed, and there remained alſo ſo Univerſal a reſpect and obedience to the cheife Biſhop of the Church notoriouſly known to be the upholder of true doctrine, that the Church wanted not meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide Controverſies as farre as the neceſſity of thoſe times required: whence the <hi>Quartodecimani</hi> although they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed nothing ſet down clearly in Scripture, were Iudged Heretikes for oppoſing the doctrine of the firſt Church made evidently known by freſh Tradition. Now as the Church could want Councils for ſo many years, ſo it could want Councils for the ſhort ſpace of ſchiſm. For the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of new declarations it not ſo frequent at leaſt in any high degree of neceſſity, calling for inſtant remedy, and a reme-of this nature only, Scripture alone, you ſay will remedy this neceſſity. We beſides ſcripture have alwayes at hand, the many definitions of former Councils, and the known Traditions of the Church, which alone ſerved Gods Church in thoſe two thouſand yeares before Scripture, and for two thouſand yeares more ſerved the faithful amongſt the Gentiles who had not the Scriptures, which remained almoſt ſolely and alone to the Iewes. <hi>Ninthly</hi> you ask <hi>if the Pope and Council do differ at any time about ſome queſtion, what ſhall be defined?</hi> I anſwer nothing ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined becauſe this eſſential hinderance manifeſteth no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of ſuch a particular queſtion, to it at that time neceſſary for the preſervation of the Church; for if this depended upon ſuch a preſent definition, the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40740:196"/> (whom you ſtill forget) would not forget to inſpire the parties requiſite to do their duties. Tenthly you ask <hi>how my opinion ſtands with theirs who affirm the government of the Church to be Monarchicall by Chriſts inſtitution.</hi> I anſwer our government in <hi>England</hi> was Monarchical this laſt five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and yet our Monarchs could not do all things without a Parliament. Again thoſe who make the Pope ſufficiently aſſiſted to define all alone, cannot poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what I ſay, to wit, that he is ſufficiently aſſiſted when he defineth with a Councel. <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> you ask, <hi>How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (general) <hi>Councells have been oppoſite to one another.</hi> I anſwer. Not ſo much as one. You ask again, <hi>in which or with which did he not erre.</hi> I anſwer, he neither erred in or with any. In the <hi>Nicene</hi> he erred not, as you will grant, nor in the three next General Councels, as your Church of England grants. He ſubſcribed not in the Councel of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> how then did he erre in it? yea becauſe he ſubſcribed not, that Councel is never accounted lawful by any but <hi>Arrians;</hi> or if your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church accounted that a lawful Councel, they muſt admit that, whileſt they admit the firſt foure Councels. So that I am amazed to ſee a learned man four or five times object the contrariety of the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> to the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> to prove from thence that two lawful general Councels can be oppoſite to one another, you knowing well that this Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> was no lawful Councel, the cheif Biſhop and head of the Church not ſubſcribing in it. Tell mee I pray, if by all your great reading, you can find one ſingle Holy Father who did ever cenſure any one general Councel of doctrine, in any one point either falſe, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to any former lawful general Councel. In what age then live we, which licenſeth every Mechanical fellow, freely to tax the Councels of all ages of errours againſt Scripture. This is the fruit of crying out <hi>in what Councel or with what Councel did not the Pope erre. Twelfthly,</hi> you ask me (I pray ſee my 12. Number above, fine) <hi>did ever
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40740:196"/> any of the ancient councels determine of their own infallibility.</hi> I anſwer the ancienteſt councel of all ſaid, <hi>Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis, It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and us.</hi> Could any thing fallible ſeem good to the Holy Ghoſt? Or to a council lawfully aſſembled in the holy Ghoſt, as all lawful councils were ever ſuppoſed by themſelves to be? and upon this ground they ever aſſumed an authority ſufficient not only to be ſecurely followed by the whole Church in their definitions, but denounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> to the rejectors of their definitions; which had been wickedly done if there might have been errours in faith. The moſt bloudy perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of tyrants could not have been halfe ſo pernitious to the Church, as it was thus to be taught, and compelled by the unanimous authority of Chriſtendome, to embrace that as Catholick doctrine, which is an errour in faith. And ſurely a practice ſo Univerſal, ſo frequent, and yet ſo pernitious, would have been cried out upon over and over again, by the moſt zealous and learned ancient Fathers, who notwithſtanding never opened their mouthes againſt this proceding of councils which could not be juſtifiable. For this proceeding of ſetling a court of ſo great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and an everlaſting Court to be called in matters of greateſt moment until the end of the world, ſo to teach the world in all ages the Catholick truth, in greateſt points, if in place of this truth, errors againſt faith could have been perpetually obtruded even to the whole world, and that with the greateſt authority in the world; and this under pain of being cut off from the body of Chriſt; imagin if you can a thing more pernitious then this. And yet this was the proceeding of all antiquity if the Church were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible as you ſay. <hi>Thirtenthly</hi> you aſk me <hi>what I think of Nazianzens opinion about councels in his Ep. to Procopius</hi> the 12 as you ſay, but I find it in the 42. Sir I think if what you have ſaid, againſt the proof of any point out of the General conſent of Fathers, be true; no ſingle proof, brought from ſome one of them, can have any force out of your mouth, what force ſoever it might have had out
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40740:197"/> of a Mouth uſed to ſpeak otherwiſe of them. But you are preſſing &amp; aſking, <hi>ſhall I tell you,</hi> yes Sir tell me. Yet let me tell you that what he ſaith will be nothing to the purpoſe unles he can be ſhewed to ſpeak of a lawful free General Councel called, and directed by the chiefe Paſtor of the Church preſiding in it: now Sir tell me, doth he ſpeak of ſuch a councel? His words are, <hi>I am thus affected as to ſhun all meetings of Biſhops,</hi> (if I muſt ſpeak the truth) <hi>for I never ſaw any good end of a Synod, nor that had an end of evils more then an addition.</hi> Sir you much wrong this grave Father if you think he ſpeaketh of ſuch councils as I now mentioned. Before his ſpeaking theſe words there had been but one ſuch council, to wit, that of <hi>Nice.</hi> Let us hear from himſelf his opinion of this one councel out of thoſe Treatiſes which goe juſt before his Epiſtles, which you might have read as well as them. In the firſt of theſe Treatiſes being aſked the moſt <hi>certain doctrine of faith;</hi> He anſwereth that it is <hi>that which was promulgated by the Holy Fathers</hi> at <hi>Nice, &amp; that he never did prefer nor was able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing before</hi> it, ſo He Tract. 50. And in his next Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe he explicates this faith at large. And in the end he ſaith <hi>he doth imbrace the treatiſe of this council to the uttermoſt power of his mind, knowing it oppoſed with invincible verity againſt all Hereticks,</hi> and in his Orations to Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>The Fathers of this council were gathered by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> then, who ſpeaketh thus, had the ſame ſpirit that the other Saint Gregory (the great) who ſaid, <hi>I doe profeſſe my ſelfe to reverence the firſt fower councils as I reverence the fower bookes of the Goſpel. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do I reverence the fift council. Whoſoever is of another mind let him be an Anathema, l.</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſtol. Ep. prope finem.</hi> He then who thus reverenced lawful general councils, did not doubtles ſpeak the former words concerning them. But did he perhaps ſpeak them of lawful particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils? No, how then? It was hard fortune to live in a time, in which the Arrians had ſo great power that they diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the lawful proceedings of ſeveral particular councils.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40740:197"/> Hence the councils of <hi>Seleucum, Tirus, Ariminu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Millan, Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> came to unfortunate concluſions, rather encreaſing then leſſening the former evils. Neither were the times ſo altered that there appeared any great likelyhood that in thoſe parts, any better concluſion could be expected of that council to which he was called, when he writ that Epiſtle. So alſo Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> (his boſom friend) writing at that time to Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Ep. 52. ſaid <hi>He thought it impoſsible for a General Council to be aſſembled in thoſe</hi> times. Clear then it is that Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpoke only of ſuch councils as had lately been held and could be held in thoſe daies, in which the Arrians would be ſure to croſſe all that might be good and to make thoſe <hi>particular meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> patronize their cauſe. What you further ſpeak of a private Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi> telling the Fathers of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trent to their face, <hi>of their falling with one conſent from Religion to ſuperſtition, from Faith unto infidelity, from Chriſt unto Antichriſt, from God to Epicurus,</hi> is a thing I never yet did read in any credible Hiſtorian; And I dare ſay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any credible Hiſtorian, from Chriſts time until that time, ever could find ſuch a ſaucy ſpeech to relate in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, uſed as yet by any modeſt, or immodeſt Catholicke to the face of a Councel. And can you put on a forehead to countenance ſuch a ſpeech, not having any one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from Chriſts time to this day as I ſaid? So it is. The Catholikes and onely the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholikes have been the men who were ſtill imployed in upholding the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of councils of Fathers, and you cannot (I ſay it again and again) find an example from Chriſts time unto this age, of any who were not known Hereticks, who were carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the authority of councils or Fathers. You ſpoke full enough before of the Fathers. I think you have not wanted much of doing your worſt againſt councels, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you ſaid in another place, <hi>In what do we oppoſe Councels?</hi> and you would ſeem to acknowledge them the higheſt Tribunal on earth, though ſo much be ſaid,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40740:198"/> for their vilification. And when you have cried down the authority of Fathers &amp; patronized the reprochful language of this private Man againſt a whole council, of what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do you think this one private mans ſaying could be?</p>
            <p n="21">21. Hence you ſee how little all this ſerveth for an anſwer of what yet is to be anſwered in the 21 Number of my former paper, ſpecially when I ſhall have added the other proofs which I have of the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt promiſed to his Church. Of this by and by. Now you invite me to re-examin the Determinations of the council of <hi>Trent.</hi> It appeareth by what I ſaid Chap. 2. Num. 4.5.6.7. <hi>That it is fine doctrine that determinations of councils ſhould be examined by ſuch as I and you are.</hi> Have we ſuch aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt as councils have? Have we halfe the authority, or any thing like one quarter of even the wit and learning which they have? Sir, Let us two ſet down and examine how true this is which I ſhall now ſay.

But now if the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeable againſt the councils be evidently cleare Texts, do you think to perſwade any pious and prudent Man, that ſo very many (and many of them ſo very eminent for piety and for prudence) as are known to have ſubſcribed to ſo many General Councils, not to have been able to ſee that which hath been evidently ſet down before all their Eyes in clear Scripture? God give us Humility. God give us charity. God have mercy upon us in the bitter day of his Iudgment, if we paſſe ſo bitter a Iudgment againſt the whole Church repreſentative. And yet if you paſſe not this bitter Iudgment, you will never paſſe this objection without being poſed.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:40740:198"/>22. Good Sir, what mean you here to bid me ſay no more of this point (concerning the Holy Ghoſt giving to his Church an aſſiſtance reaching to infallibility,) but you would have me now meaſure the infallibility of our councils or Churches by their determinations, and to ſee how they agree with Scripture. <hi>Let us not</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſee your opinions by infallibility but your infallibility by your deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſet forth by your Church.</hi> Remember Sir, what you find in the 7 Number of this chapter where you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to inſtruct me in the right way of diſputing, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which I ſhould not ſtand ſhewing the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations to be ſuch as ſhould be obeyed, but I ſhould ſhew <hi>à priori</hi> (as they ſay) that ſhe is infallible and that therefore her definitions are to be admitted. Now when I come to do what you would have me to do, you cry out, ſay no more of this point, but go now the other way, caſt the weight of this argument upon the other ſhoulder. It galleth me upon this. Sir, by your good leave I muſt dwell upon this argument yet a great while. The more it preſſeth the better it is.</p>
            <p n="23">23. This I will do by paſſing to my 22. Number,<note place="margin">Of my 22th. Number.</note> where firſt you ſtumble, and then tread upon <hi>Luther.</hi> Let him ly where you will. He is no better then his Fathers. I ſtep over him: and ſo prove this infallibility of the Church. I cite Saint <hi>Paul, Tim.</hi> 3.15. calling <hi>the Church of the living God the pillar and ground of Faith. May not all ſecurely in their faith, rely upon the pillar of Truth? May they not moſt groundedly ground themſelves upon the ground of Truth it ſelf?</hi> You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>There is a double pillar, and a double ground, one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, the Scripture, the other leſs principal and ſubordinate, the Church.</hi> But this double dealing in diſtinguiſhing help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you not. The Church muſt ſtill be a true pillar, and a true ground of Truth. The people <hi>believed God and Moſes,</hi> ſaith the Scripture. <hi>Moſes</hi> was infinitely under God, yet this hindred not his being truly ſuch a pillar of Truth as was to be relied upon ſecurely in matters of Faith. I
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40740:199"/> apply all to <hi>Moſes</hi> in reſpect of God, what you apply to the Scripture in reſpect of the Church. And yet after all this as they might rely upon <hi>Moſes</hi> as a pillar of Truth, ſo we upon the Church. All true believers for two thouſand years before the writing of Scripture had no other ground to ſtand upon but this Church, the ground of Truth. And therefore a ground ſure enough, and yet not ſure enough if fallible. Yea, the true believers to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did write theſe words. <hi>The Church is the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> had not the whole Canon of the Scripture, which collectively taken maketh your other ground of Chriſtian belief to ſtand upon; therefore Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Church as of ſuch a pillar of truth, and ſuch a ground of truth, as might then be ſecurely relied upon in all matters of faith; and confeſſedly as then the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers had not the Scriptures ſufficiently compleated to be their adaequate Rule of Faith. Now after the writings of theſe, Scripture recommending the Church <hi>as the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> this ground was ſo far from growing weaker, that the confirmation of Scripture added new force to it. I have now ſhewed you the Text, in which without any ſubordination to Scripture (as then not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) the Church was by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>the pillar and ground of Truth.</hi> Now ſhew me your Text in which there muſt be a ſubordination, and ſuch a ſubordination as may make the Church not to be truly ſuch a pillar and ſuch a ground of Truth, as all men may not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on it any longer as they did before all Scripture was written. I call for your Text, not for your reaſon, againſt which other Reaſons will ſoon be found. And as for that ſaying of Saint <hi>Irenaus, the Scripture is the pillar and ground of Truth;</hi> it hath not upon his ſaying greater authority, then the terming of the Church the pillar and ground of truth hath upon the authority of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> My proofe, as grounded on S. <hi>Paul,</hi> is ſtronger then yours as grounded on St. <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> yet I make not St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> contrary to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:40740:199"/> what he ſaith of the Scripture I yeild for true, yeild me what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that I may ground my faith upon the Church. This I cannot do unleſs God ſpeaketh by his Church. If God ſpeaketh by his Church I pray believe what he ſpeaketh. He telleth me by his Church, that I am to admitt of the Scriptures as his undoubted word, upon this his telling me ſo, I ground that faith by which I believe the Scriptures, ſo that I believe the Scriptures for the Church, which faith of mine is as ſurely grounded as was the faith of the true believers, who at that very time, in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did write theſe words, did ground their faith in all points upon the Church as you cannot deny. And thus in repect of us, the Church is firſt believed independently of Scripture, to which we are moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently moved by ſuch motives as I have ſpecified, and the Scripture in order to us, cometh to be acknowledged as Gods word upon the authority of the Church, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other aſſured ſtay (ſpeaking of the whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Canon) to know the true Scripture from falſe. The Scripture is not the firſt Principle, but upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that every one among chriſtians admit of it for Gods Word, and ſo we argue out of it againſt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But ſpeaking of him, who is to begin to be a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian (as where all once began) he cannot admit of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as men admit of the firſt Principles of Sciences, which of themſelves appear ſo clearly true, that all you can bring to prove their truth will appear leſſe true then thoſe Principles appear by themſelves. The Scripture is not the firſt Principle in this ſenſe appearing evidently by its own light to be Gods Word, as I have ſhewed at large. And this anſwereth all you ſay until you come to make good your new interpretation of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unheard of to all antiquity, and to all men until this age. Neceſſity now forced men to their ſhifts to put off Scripture when it made againſt them. Theſe words muſt now be neceſſarily referred to that which is ſaid in the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40740:200"/> verſe following concerning the myſtery of the Incarnation, and ſo (though St. <hi>Paul</hi>) did write this Epiſtle in Greek, he muſt needs be ſaid to have uſed here <hi>an Ebraiſme.</hi> And why muſt he needs be ſaid to have done ſo here in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place becauſe ſomtimes ſuch <hi>Ebraiſms</hi> be uſed in the new Teſtament. Whether this reaſon wil juſtifie ſo new an interpretation of words (even for a thouſand and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeares applied to the Church, never applied to the Miſtery of the Incarnation) ſhall be determined even by the Principles of one of your greateſt Divines now living I mean <hi>Dr. Jeremy Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Diſcourſe of the Liberty of prophecying</hi> Sect. 4. <hi>An other great pretence</hi> (for juſtifying new interpretations) <hi>is the conference of places (which you would uſe here by conferring</hi> this place to ſome few places in which ſuch <hi>Ebraiſmes</hi> be uſed in Greek) <hi>A thing of ſuch indefinite capacity that if there be ambiguity of words, variety of ſence, alteration of circumſtances or difference of ſtile amongſt Divine writers, there is nothing which may be more abuſed by wilful people, or may more eaſily deceive the unwary or that may amuſe the moſt intelligent obſervours.</hi> This he proveth by ſeveral examples, and then he truly ſaith, <hi>This is a fallacy a Poſſe ad eſſe.</hi> It is poſſible a thing ſometimes may be ſo, therefore undoubtedly here it is ſo. There be ſuch <hi>Ebraiſmes</hi> ſome where, therefore they muſt needs be here, where for a thouſand and five hundred yeares no man obſerved any ſuch thing, Moſt truly ſaith the ſame Doctor, <hi>This is the great way of anſwering</hi> all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which can be brought againſt any thing that any <hi>man hath a mind to defend.</hi> Sir you who make the Scripture judge of all Controverſies ſhould not (of all men) juſtifie ſuch liberty of new interpretation as this your proceeding would bring in. Or if you doe you will ſoon ſee (and may already ſee it) that your judge will be made to ſpeak what each party pleaſeth. And thus will be unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide any thing. But to proceed, The Church, truly being (before the Canon was written) <hi>the pillar and ground of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:40740:200"/> truth</hi> in it ſelf without any ſubordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that the believers looked no further then that God taught them ſuch and ſuch things by the Church, I have from the text all I deſire to prove, that Gods aſſiſtance promiſed to the Church ſhould reach as farre as infallibility. Whether this infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be equal to that of the Apoſtles or no maketh not to the purpoſe, ſo long as it is granted that our faith relying upon her authority doth rely as ſecurely as that which relies upon the Pillar and ground of truth. Here you come in with a parentheſis noting me for a <hi>French</hi> Catholique, for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infallibility to the Pope defining with a council. Sir, you are no Schollar if you know not that all Roman Catholiques allow infallibility to the Pope defining with a council.</p>
            <p n="24">24 But becauſe I ſay alſo that God ſpeaketh by his Church propoſing infallibly his truth by her mouth, you tell me that I hence may plainly ſee how the Roman tyranny drawes me neceſſarily into peril of blaſphemy. A deepe charge, needing a ſtrong proof. And yet all your proof <hi>is becauſe now there is no need of Scripture ſince God ſpeakes as infallibly by his Church as by his word</hi> Sir, I pray why is it more blaſphemy to ſay that God ſpeaketh by Chriſts Church, who ſpoke infallibly by the Church of the law of Nature for two thouſand yeares (ſee here Numb. 32.) And when he then began to ſpeak by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Scripture to the Jewes, he ſtill by his Church ſpoke to the faithful among the Gentiles) and the Jewes might have grounded their faith on that voice) for two thouſand yeares more. And when the writers of the former parts of the new Teſtament did write what they writ, and when St. <hi>Paul</hi> did write what he writ, God did infallibly teach all by the Church; and yet theſe writers thought Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neceſſary, but not neceſſary for all the ends for which you may think them neceſſary. Again, what a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proofe is this to ground a charge of blaſphemy upon ſo vaſt a multitude, as adhere to the Roman Church? There is no need of Scripture if God ſpeaketh by his Church to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40740:201"/> infallibility. Did not God ſpeak to infallibility by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures teaching that Jeſus was the Meſſias? Was it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meer blaſphemy to account St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent by God to teach the ſame with infallible aſſurance? Was it therefore neer blaſphemy to think that voice was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by which God the Father teſtified the ſame from Heaven? Was it therefore neer blaſphemy, to account the teſtimony of miracles (ordained to teſtifie the ſame thing) infallible, though Chriſt calleth it <hi>teſtimonium majus Joanne. Joan.</hi> 5? Or rather is it not neer blaſphemy to ſay all theſe teſtimonies beſides Scripture are needleſs? Do you not ſee that after all the teſtimonies of God by the Scripture, and by the Church, that ſtill millions do not believe? Why is then one of theſe teſtimonies ſuperfluous? The Church is not more Enthuſiaſtical now then ſhe was for 4. thouſand years before ſhe had all the promiſes which Chriſt made her of aſſiſtance, which ſhould be at leaſt as ſpeciall and full, as ſhe ever had before. Before ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered only what ſhe had received by Tradition. Now ſhe delivereth what ſhe received by Tradition and by Scripture, in interpreting of which (according to that ſenſe truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt) the ſame Holy Ghoſt doth aſſiſt her; ſo that here is no new Revelation claimed to be made to her, but an infallible aſſiſtance to propoſe faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what was formerly revealed. If others claimful aſſurance by the Spirit in any point, let them ſhew as good promiſes made to them in particular, as are made to the Church, and we ſhalt never account theſe falſe Enthuſiaſts. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance being promiſed to the Church by God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be voted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her by the multitude of miſ-believers who oppoſe her, tho you ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all looſ to vote againſt her.</p>
            <p n="25">25 After all, you will have St. <hi>Paul</hi> call the Church the Pillar and ground of truth with an intention only to ſet forth the office, and not with an intention to ſet forth the authority of the Church. Sir, how can you know St. <hi>Paul</hi> intention but by his words? And ſure I am that no word
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:40740:201"/> could in breif more fully ſet forth her infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then by declaring her to be the pillar it ſelfe, and the ground of truth. When he uſeth ſuch words as declare this as ſufficiently as need to be, how know you that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to declare this ſufficiently? I ask alſo in any mans apprehenſion, what office of the Church is ſignified by calling her <hi>the ground of truths?</hi> In which words an aſſuredly grounded authority will preſently appear to be ſignified. O but you know his intention was to ſignifie the office only of the Church, and not her Authority, <hi>becauſe he meant here to inſtruct Timothy how to carry himſelfe in the Church of God, and to this purpoſe it had been impertinent to ſpeak of her Authority,</hi> as you think. I think it was very pertinent to ſpeak of it even to this purpoſe. For is it not fit that in a Church, which is to be held for the publick Oracle of the world, the cheif Paſtors of this Church (eſpecially thoſe who were to be firſt of all made cheife Paſtors) ſhould behave themſelves ſo, as not to make men believe it improbable that God ſhould aſſiſt infallibly ſuch a Church? How much do, not your multitude only, but your greateſt Doctors think themſelves to ſay againſt the infallibility promiſed to ſuch a Church as ours is, in which they ſee ſometimes ſcandalous Popes, ſcandalous Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, ſcandalous Biſhops, &amp;c. Which though it be a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful argument, becauſe ſcandalous men, and <hi>Solomon</hi> the Idolater have been aſſiſted with an infallibility to be Writers of Scripture it ſelfe, yet it is an argument which troubleth weak ſoules. And therefore to take away ſuch ſcandals, it is very convenient that Biſhops, eſpecially thoſe who were firſt of all preferred to that office, ſhould be <hi>blameleſs, continent, vigilant, ſober, of good behaviour;</hi> and <hi>that they ſhould have a good report even from the enemies of the Church.</hi> Alſo, that the <hi>Deacons ſhould be grave, not double tongued, not given to much Wine or covetous.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like precepts as theſe were much to the purpoſe, and as ſo were here given by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to maintain the credit
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40740:202"/> of ſuch a Church as might ſeem to all fit to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Oracle of the World. <hi>The Pillar and ground of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="59">59 Let us heare how you argue here. <hi>If the infallibility of the Church were here affirmed, then Timothy needed not ſuch inſtructions to take care how he behaved himſelf in the Church, ſince infallible aſsiſtance is immediate, and that which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate includes no time for the inſpiration, nor means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> ſo you. A ſtrange Conſequence. The Church is infallible in defining points in a general Councel, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man needeth inſtructions for his private good behaviour. Was it ſo for the firſt two thouſand yeares before the Scripture was written? Or do we perhaps teach this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance to be communicated to every one immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly? And how is it true that the aſſiſtance which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate to the Church aſſembled in a full Council, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no time for the inſpiration, nor no means for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</hi> Do you think that as ſoon as all are aſſembled they are preſently all, or the greater part, to define all things as faſt as they are propoſed; was it ſo when the Apoſtles and the Elders of the Church were aſſembled together in the firſt Councel? though this iſſued forth their decree with this preface. <hi>It ſeemed Good to the Holy Ghoſt and us.</hi> Was there no time required for this ſhort Decree. No means uſed before it was made? Read thoſe words. <hi>The Apoſtles and the Elders coming together to conſider of the matter And when there had been much diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Peter roſe up and ſaid.</hi> There followeth his ſpeech. Then St. <hi>James</hi> made an other ſpeech, To what purpoſe all theſe ſpeeches, and theſe made after former <hi>much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,</hi> if your doctrine be true, that <hi>neither time nor uſe of any be to proceed the immediate aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt</hi> which they had undoubtedly. And here as if you had proved ſome thing you have a fling at the Council of Trent for ſitting ſo long; a thing as little derogatory to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils infallibility, as that <hi>much diſputing,</hi> and making ſeveral
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40740:202"/> ſpeeches was derogatory to the infallibility of the council of the Apoſtles, in which onely one ſhort Decree was made. Look on the many Canons, and Decrees for Reformation, in matters ſubject to great Diſputes, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſecular power (which croſſed not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles firſt Council) Look on the multitude of Hereſies condemned, after a full hearing of all that could be ſaid by all parties, and it muſt needs be rather a point of ſatisfaction to all, then a ſcandal unto any, to ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration uſed. But both a ſlow and a haſtie, and a mean delivery of any ones condemnation, will be diſtaſteful to the condemned perſon.</p>
            <p n="27">27. As for the Authoritie of St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> calling the definition of the council of <hi>Nice,</hi> by which the Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of God the Son with his Father, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> it ſheweth clearly, that this prime Doctor held that God delivered his Word unto us by the council. Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is that the councils Definition did not bind with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Authority of the Council, but by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture Miniſterially propoſed by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Sir, I have already ſhewed, Chap. 2.

O! This Declaration of Gods Word by the council, he boldly ſaid, <hi>The Word of God, by the Council of Nice remained for ever.</hi> After this, you come in again with the council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> contending that council as well to be believed for it ſelf as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice.</hi> And you think if more exceptions could have been made againſt the authority of the council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> againſt his <hi>Arrian</hi> adverſary might eaſily, have Prevailed, by inſiſting onely upon the authority of the council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which he waveth, and goeth to arguments out of Scripture.

This controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie then being one of the moſt neceſſary muſt clearly according to your doctrine be decided for you againſt me by plain Scripture. If then I can but ſhew that it is not thus clearly decided againſt me, I clearly ſhew that I hold no errour in this point.

               </gap>t, that the Church is Infallible) cannot be demonſtrated by plain Scripture to be ſo. Therefore what I hold is no error. Now I muſt prove that what I hold of the infallibility of the Church cannot by clear Scripture be demonſtrated to be an error. This I prove thus. The Scripture is not ſo clear againſt this as it is for this. Therefore this cannot by clear Scripture be demonſtrated to be an error. My firſt propoſition muſt be ſhewed by citing as clear texts for what I hold of this point, as you can bring againſt it. Well then, for this point I have alledged in the beginning of this chapter, the text, promiſing, <hi>That the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt this Church; and that text which tels us we muſt hear the Church under pain of being by Gods judgement accounted as Publicans and Heathens, and that the Church is the Pillar and ground of truth.</hi>

Your anſwer to this Text ſhall be rendred in your own words that you may not complain of foul play. Your words were, <hi>Although the promiſe be extendible to the end of the world, yet it is not neceſſary to underſtand it ſo, as that there ſhall alwayes be equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of aſsiſtance to the times of the Apoſtles, which is hard to affirme ſince we cannot ſee that there is any ſuch neceſsity for ſuch aſsiſtance.</hi> And by thoſe words <hi>ſuch aſsiſtance.</hi> Your laſt reply ſheweth that you meane <hi>aſsiſtance extended to Infallibility.</hi> Sir, ſtand to Scripture and ſhew out of the Text that he promiſeth to be with them, ſecuring them from all error in the firſt age, and he promiſeth not ſo much for the ſecond or third age. Againſt your reaſons we have our reaſons, bring againſt my illimited text another text, teaching clearly that my Text ought to be limited to a ſmaller aſſiſtance in other ages then was here promiſed for the firſt. As for the neceſſity of the people (which was the prime reaſon why Chriſt gave this infallibility) it was greater in ages remoter from Chriſt, you <hi>ask why then be our traditions now equally infallible to thoſe of theſe times.</hi> I anſwer that as it is harder to prove now that Chriſt did ſuch miracles, was crucified, did riſe again, then it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after theſe things happened, yet all theſe things be as infallibily true now, as they were then, and as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; ſo I ſay of Traditions, which for all this doe not loſe a ſufficient meaſure of infallible certainty. But to go on. What if there be no ſuch neceſſity of ſuch aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for other ages; what Text have you to prove that God muſt needs give no more then is neceſſary, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promiſe more, and give what he promiſeth? I know you will ſay this infallibility in ages after the Scripture was not neceſſary, becauſe the Scriptures alone would ſerve to decide all controverſies. Sir, did not the Church
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40740:204"/> alone ſerve to decide all Controverſies before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was written. Yes, Why then was Scripture thought neceſſary by you even for this end, for which the Church was well provided before? Again, the old Scripture, did it not teſtifie, as much as was neceſſary, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt was the true Meſsias?</hi> Yes. To what end then was Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent to teſtifie this? To what end a voyce ſent from Heaven to teſtifie this? To what end ſo many Miracles wrought to teſtifie this? To what end did Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſtill further teſtifie this? Mark here how falſe your judgement is in thinking God will promiſe juſt what is neceſſary, and no more. Sir, in Ages after the firſt when the Church ſhould grow from a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, to be a Tree of vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, in ſuch a vaſt compaſſe, and in progreſſe of many Ages a world of doubts would riſe, <hi>which Bookes were Scripture, which not? Which corrupted Scripture, which not? Which was the undoubted ſenſe of the uncorrupted Scripture, which not?</hi> Why might not Chriſt (for any thing you know by Scripture) think this a ſufficient Reaſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe an aſſiſtance extended to infallibility for other Ages of the Church as well as for the firſt age. Will an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo aſſiſted to teſtifie all this infallibly be leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then ſo many Authorities to Teſtifie that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was the true Meſſias, after it was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Teſtified by true Scripture? And all theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies were given to the Jewes, as ill as they were diſpoſed. How then can you ſay of the Church of Chriſt, that ſhe, for want of this Diſpoſition, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this Aſſiſtance in all Ages but the firſt? VVhat you adde of Traditions, hath been already Anſwered: See alſo Number Twelve. But what you adde of Scripture having ſtill the ſame cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie is apparently falſe, ſpeaking (as you ſpeake) in Order to aſſure us. For you your ſelfe confeſſe, that divers Bookes of Scripture (as the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:40740:205"/> &amp;c.) are now held certain, which were not held ſo before. Again, many, and a good many, bookes of Scripture are quite loſt. How know you by Scripture only, that no neceſſary point for practice or beliefe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe bookes only) did not periſh with the bookes themſelves. And as for the bookes we have, you ſee how uncertain we remain about the true ſenſe of them in higheſt points. Then they had the Apoſtles themſelves, or the known Diſciples of the Apoſtles, to tell them the meaning of theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is this ſo really, or figuratively only; Theſe words, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all Nations,</hi> do or do not, include Infants. To be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> was to have power to ſacrifice, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, or was it not? Now times make theſe held for uncertainties; whereas by and by you admit that by this promiſe of Chriſt, the Church is ſecure from damnable error, though not from all ſimple errors, for then no body ſhould be left for God to be withal; you admit that which will deſtroy quite what you ſaid before. For before you ſaid, <hi>Hereſie conſiſted in oppoſition to clear Scripture:</hi> whence all thoſe muſt needs be Hereticks who oppoſed clear Scripture. Therefore all thoſe who held theſe prime points in which you and we differ, with us againſt you, were Hereticks; for they held theſe points, which (as you ſay) are againſt clear Scripture; But by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion Chriſt had no viſible Church baptizing, teaching all Nations, &amp;c. but thoſe who held theſe prime points in which we and you differ; wherefore we muſt confeſſe that Chriſt was with theſe Oppoſers of evident Scripture, or elſe you cannot ſhew with what Members of the Church he was for all theſe laſt ages preceding the Reformation. Let us go on.</p>
            <p n="30">30. What kind of aſſiſtance Chriſt promiſed, may be gathered (behold a fifth Text) out of ſeveral words in the 14. chapter of Saint <hi>John,</hi> there (verſe 15.) he ſaith, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give another Comforter,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40740:205"/> that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive.</hi> And verſe 27. <hi>The Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is the Holy Ghoſt whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things and ſuggeſt unto you all things whatſoever I ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> And chap. 16. ver. 12. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you; How be it when the ſpirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth.</hi> I aske now according to theſe Texts, How long is this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth to abide with them in their ſucceſſours? <hi>For ever;</hi> ſaith the Text. Shall he alſo ſecure thoſe, with whom he for ever abideth, from all errour? <hi>He will guide you into all Truth,</hi> ſaith the Text. Give me then leave, leſſe to regard what you ſay to the contrary. Where there is <hi>all Truth,</hi> there is no errour. If you anſwer there is no Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental errour. I Reply, that <hi>all Truth</hi> excludes all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, either in points Fundamental, or not Fundamental. And being you cannot aſſuredly tell me which points be Fundamental, which not; which deſtructive of ſalvation, which not; which be curable, which are not; you muſt grant me that ſhe is to be believed in all points. And fear not to believe her, <hi>She will guide you into all Truth.</hi> Therfore you may ſecurely follow her in all herwaies. This promiſe of Chriſt made equally to the Apoſtles, and to their ſucceſſours, the viſible Teachers and Guides of the Church which were to guide people into all Truth <hi>for ever,</hi> muſt needs have been verified all this laſt thouſand years before your Reformation. All this time, all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Guides or Prelates of the Church were led, and did lead into opinions contrary to the Tenets of your Church. But all this time <hi>the ſpirit of Truth did abide with them, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into all Truth.</hi> Therefore the opinions contrary to your Tenets were true, and not errors. If he ſhould be with your Prelats beginning this laſt age to hold contrary to the Prelats of the laſt thouſand years) he ſhould be with thoſe who teach contradictions in points of belief, oppoſite to the former belief. Behold a clear reaſon why I appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40740:206"/> this promiſe to our Biſhops and Church, and not to yours, the Holy Ghoſt could not teach thoſe guides of the Church <hi>forever,</hi> who for a vaſt long time of many ages were not in the World. Shew me a ſucceſſion in all Ages of the guides or lawful Paſtors of any Church hould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Texts in points differing from ours, and then I muſt labour to find a reaſon why I ſay the Holy Ghoſt, ever ſince Chriſts time, guided the lawful Paſtors of our Church into all truth, rather then the lawful Paſtors of your Church, which Paſtors had no being in the Church or world and conſequently no capacity to be guided into all truth.</p>
            <p n="31">31 <hi>A Sixth Text</hi> to prove this aſſiſtance to be extended to infallibility is 4 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> whence appeareth that the end and intention of Chriſt <hi>in giving</hi> us (who were viſible in all ages) <hi>Doctors and Paſtors</hi> for all ages was ſuch an end, and ſuch an intention, as could not be compaſſed by ſuch Doctors and Paſtors as might <hi>lead us into circumvention of errour,</hi> even then when they where aſſembled together to deliver the truth from their higheſt tribunal in a General Council How pittifully would <hi>the Saints be conſummated</hi> by ſuch Doctors? How pittifully would <hi>the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> be performed, how pittifully would <hi>the Body of Chriſt be edified by ſuch</hi> Doctors and Paſtors. Laſtly how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would it be for us by the having of ſuch doctors, and Paſtors <hi>that wee now</hi> (provided of ſuch guides) <hi>be not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren wavering and carried about with the wind of doctrine in the wickedneſs of men, in craftineſs, in circumvention of error.</hi> You ſee St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms the Doctors and Paſtors which are given unto us, to be given for this end (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſufficiently aſſiſted to the ſame) that we may ſecurely reſt in their doctrine, which we may not do in any erroneous doctrine, be the errour little or great. For it were a ridiculous thing to ſay, <hi>we were to reſt circumvented in error, leaſt we ſhould fall into circumvention of error.</hi> The aſſiſtance therefore is ſuch as preſerves from all error, and ſuch an aſſiſtance was proportionable to Gods intention of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40740:206"/> Securing us from having reaſon to <hi>waver</hi> or to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and changing, ſo to cure ſome curable errors, with which we feared to be circumvented, whereas by the unanimous doctrine of theſe Doctors and Paſtors, God intended to preſerve us ſufficiently from ever falling <hi>into circumvention of errour.</hi>

            <p n="33">33 Hence (for an <hi>Eight Text</hi>) I may well alledge what this Prophet infers from hence in the Next Chapter, where he triumpheth in the Church thus teaching all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and there he addeth, <hi>For the nation and Kingdom that ſhall not ſerve thee ſhall periſh,</hi> verſe 12.

            <p n="34">34 For a <hi>ninth Text</hi> (letting all theſe laſt Texts of <hi>Eſay</hi> paſſe as for one) I alledged that of <hi>Daniel</hi> 2.44. <hi>In the daies of thoſe Kingdoms the God of Heaven ſhall raiſe up a Kingdome, which ſhall not be diſperſed, and his Kingdome ſhall not be delivered to another people.</hi> And that we might know that he ſpeaketh here of the kingdome of Chriſt, which ſhould be viſible to us all, there is added a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which muſt needs make it moſt viſible, to wit. <hi>And it ſhall break in peices and conſume all thoſe</hi> (Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous) <hi>Kingdomes and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Now if this true Church of Chriſt, which ſo viſibly hath broken in pieces and quite aboliſhed all Idolatrous Kingdomes, be ſo viſibly <hi>to ſtand for ever,</hi> then this viſible Church cannot be ſaid, for this laſt 2000. year <hi>to have been faln;</hi> As it muſt needs be ſaid of all viſible Churches, which have bin theſe laſt thouſand years for beſides the <hi>Roman</hi> Church you will not find one viſible Church which hath not faln this time into confeſſed hereſie; therefore to verifie theſe words, you muſt ſay that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>did not fall,</hi> that ſo you may find Chriſt a viſible Church which <hi>did ſtand for ever.</hi> And thus alſo we ſhall literally expound what the Angel Gabriel ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>And he ſhall reign in the houſe of Iacob for ever</hi> Luke 1.33. This <hi>Roman</hi> Church then is the Church which hath <hi>ſtood ever</hi> ſince Chriſts time. Whence it is manifeſt that it did not fal either into idolatry (as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate hereafter when you reply to this place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40740:208"/> when it proclaim'd it ſelf to have an infallible tribunal, by which all Controverſies are to be truly decided, for erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which tribunal you Page 22. ſay <hi>ſhee is in peril of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt God the judge, in ſetting up another judge in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men.</hi> And againe Pa. 106. <hi>That for pretending to infallibility ſhe is highly preſumptious and in this more then an uſurper committing an inſolent uſurpation of the prerogative which belongeth only to God and Scripture.</hi> And P. 23. you hold this <hi>Infallibility as deſtructive to ſoules as uncertainty of true Religion, Nay (ſay you) uncertainty may be helped but infallibility hath no remedy.</hi> Surely if the Church ſhould have univerſally faln into uncertainty of true belief, it ſhould no longer have been the <hi>ſtanding Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> which ſhall <hi>ſtand for ever.</hi> But it had been a multitude faln into the want of that faith, the want of which had put it in a ſtate in which it had been impoſſible to pleaſe God.

            <p n="35">35 This being done I muſt again put you in mind that according to your doctrine, <hi>Scripture alone is able by clear Texts to decide all Controverſies according to truth,</hi> This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of the fallibility, or infallibility of the Church erected by Chriſt, is one of the moſt important Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that can be raiſed in the Church. Now you (who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Controverſy to be decided for you againſt me by clear Texts of Scripture) are obliged by clearer Texts, then all theſe are put together, to prove that Chriſts viſible Church is fallible, I ſay Chriſts viſible Church, for all my Texts ſpeak of that, and not of the Synagogue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Texts you bring muſt be concerning Chriſts Church. And you muſt bring Texts and not diſcourſes, or elſe you decide not the Controverſy by the ſentence of the judge to which only you appeal. Obſerve theſe few things and give me theſe Texts, and I here give you free leave to proclaim me quite vanquiſhed, and driven out of the field. And by this you will ſee that we adhere not therefore to the defence of the Churches Tribunal, becauſe we fear to be tried by Scripture, but becauſe upon trial made by Scripture, her Tribunal is proved infallible and in all things to be obeyed by us.</p>
            <p n="36">36. What occurreth next is, to juſtifie my ſelfe from the falſe ſlander with which you charge me <hi>of corrupting the Text in St. Auſtin Lib. de Utilitate credendi Cap.</hi> 19. Sir if I ſhould doe as you did, that is, if I ſhould only regard that Edition of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> which I have, I ſhould not only juſtifie my ſelfe but condemne you of corrupting this place. Now I onely charge the Edition which you uſed, of corruption, yea of ſuch corruption that a man could not but ſuſpect it who would read the context with his perfect ſences about him. For St. <hi>Auſtin
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40740:209"/> in his</hi> 14. <hi>Chapter,</hi> having ſaid that he firſt believed, moved by the authority of the Catholick Church, which there he ſheweth to have been done by him upon good reaſon; he cometh in the 51 <hi>Chapter</hi> to preſſe his adverſaries to the eaſieſt way of freeing themſelves from errour by yeilding to the authority of the ſame Church. And then in his <hi>Sixteenth Chapter he urgeth</hi> the wholeſomneſſe of following this authority. Here come in thoſe words which I cited, to wit, <hi>for if the divine providence of God doth not preſide in humane affairs, in vain would Sollicitude be about Religion. But if both the very beauty of all things and our inward conſcience doth both publickely and privately exhort us to ſeek out and ſerve God, we are not to diſpair that there is ſome authority appointed by the ſame God, on which authority we relying as on an aſſured ſtep may be lifted up to God.</hi> My adverſary wil needs read theſe laſt words thus. <hi>On which authority we relying as on an aſſured ſtep may be lifted up to God. Velut gradu incerto innitentes attol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luram ad Deum.</hi> As if an unaſſured or an uncertain ſtep could help to lift us up to God, and were a thing to be relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this end, and given us as a help by God to this end, that we may rely upon it, and we being ſo well provided of uncertainty in the authority appointed by God for us, ought nor to deſpair of coming by this authority to the certain truth. Is not this perfect and compleat non-ſenſe. And can you think in earneſt that here you have reaſon to tell me that the ſcope of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> diſcourſe may diſcover my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting his Text? Doth it not evidently diſcover the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of your <hi>Frobenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> Edition, <hi>An.</hi> 1569. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would needs read, <hi>Gradu incerto innitentes attellamur ad Deum,</hi> whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Editions read <hi>gradu certo innitentes</hi> even the Edition of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> whoſe judgement yours uſe to eſteem moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Yea, he in the beginning of his Edition profeſſeth to put down ſuch a Note as this is [] when he varieth from the <hi>Frobenian</hi> Edition, and yet here he putteth no ſuch note in his <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, <hi>Anno</hi> 1555. which Edition of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> is ancienter then yours. So that your <hi>Frobenian</hi> Edition cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40740:209"/> differeth in this place from that ancienter <hi>Frobenian</hi> Edition, of which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> made mention a dozen years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yours was printed. Neither can you make any thing like ſenſe of S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> words by reading them as you cited them; <hi>that by the authority appointed by God we ſhould as by an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtep be lifted up to God.</hi> So that here you may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how little reaſon you had to carp at infallibility. And again, you had as litle reaſon to put me in mind that one part of that authority of which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here ſpeaketh is drawn from the miracles which Chriſt did. Sir, do theſe miracles make this authority <hi>to be relied upon, as upon an unaſſured ſtep, or as upon an aſſured ſtep to lift us up to God.</hi> Now Sir, how ſhal you ever be able to ſecure me that you can know, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly know, corrupted Scripture from uncorrupted, when I ſee this your talent in knowing corruptions ſo deficient, as I have here ſhewed it to be, even when you are ſo confident of it that you charge your adverſary of corruption, which had you not done, he had now made no uſe of this place ſo clear to his purpoſe. But he muſt needs now expect a better anſwer from you to this place.</p>
            <p n="37">37. In my 24. <hi>I intreat you not to explicate the places which I had above alledged for the Churches infallibility,<note place="margin">Of my 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Number.</note> as if they were to be underſtood ſo as onely to be true when the Church judgeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to Scripture; for even in that ſence the devil himſelfe (father of Lyes) is infallible, ſo long as he teacheth conformable to Scripture, and the gates of hell cannot by errour prevail againſt the devil of Hell. Yea, as long as he doth this, he will be the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> that is ſubordinately as you ſpeak of the Church, to wit, <hi>ſo far as either of them rely on the written word.</hi> You anſwer firſt, <hi>that we are not commanded but forbidden to conſult with the Devil, but we are enjoyned to conſult with the Church of God.</hi> I anſwer, that this hinders not his being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as long as he ſpeaketh conformably to Scripture. And I am glad to ſee you acknowledge a command to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the Church, for ſure I am that this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of conſulting with a viſible Church and viſible in all
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40740:210"/> Ages. For people were in all ages to obey this command of conſulting with her. But it is impoſſible in any age to conſult with an inviſible Church. Therefore there was in all ages a true viſible Church. <hi>Secondly, you ſay we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes cauſe to ſuſpect the Divel.</hi> I anſwer this hinders not his being truly infallible ſo long as he teacheth conformably to Scripture. In your third anſwer you ſeem to make the divel and the Church agree, for you neither believe the divel in point of truth upon his authority, nor the Church to ſpeak truth upon her authority, wherefore for all you have ſaid as yet, the divel may as well be <hi>the pillar and ground of truth</hi> as the Church, though I confeſſe freely, <hi>it is not his office to be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again though you be not moved to think that the divel ſaith to be true, yet this hinders not his ſpeaking as true as the Church doth, as long as he ſpeaketh conformable to Scripture. And though I grant that you may in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect make more account of what the Church ſaith for her authority, then of what the devil ſaith upon his authority; yet ſtanding ſtill in our caſe, which ſuppoſeth the divel <hi>de facto</hi> to deliver what is conformable to Scripture, you (who refuſe to give an infallible aſſent to what the Church ſaith at all times but when you ſee that which ſhe ſaith to be conformable to Scripture) you I ſay, muſt never build this aſſent as infallible more upon the Church then upon the divel, to whoſe ſaying you would give an infallible aſſent when you ſee that which he ſaith to be conformable to Scripture. But whilſt you are ſo buſie in giving ſo many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to what I ſaid about the divel, you ſmother up that which clearly overthroweth the reply of you and yours, who ſay we muſt follow the Church only ſo far as we ſee her follow Scripture. For I ſhewed that thoſe who could not ſee at all how far the Church followed Scripture, were bound to follow that Church for the firſt two thouſand yeares of the world, which were before all Scripture, or before what was known to be the Scripture in ſubſtance, or before it
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40740:210"/> were known whether there ſhould be any Scripture or no. So how could thoſe many barbarous Nations, who never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the Scripture did truly believe, (as S. <hi>Ireneus</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) what was taught them by the Church, though they could not poſſibly ſee how far that which was taught them, and that which they believed, did agree with the Scripture which they had never ſeen.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Your two next paragraphs contend to take from me two of my former texts cited for the infallibility of the Church, by expounding thoſe texts not to ſpeak of the viſible Church. But I have ſhewed the contrary concerning them both. Concerning that out of <hi>Daniel</hi> I did ſhew this even now Num. 34. Concerning that out of <hi>Eſay</hi> I ſhewed it Num. 32. And 33.

            <head>
               <hi>The fifth Chapter.</hi> The Church which is our Judge, and Infallible, is the Roman Church.</head>
            <p>ALL that I am to prove here is,<note place="margin">Of my 27th. Numb.</note> that upon Suppoſition that it is now made good that the Church is our judge in all Controverſies and alſo that it is made good that ſhe is infallible, that all this can be verified of no other Church then the Roman. Whence it followeth, that whoſoever will ſay any thing againſt that which I did undertake to prove in this part of my diſcourſe, muſt argue againſt me not by denying ſome Church to be judge of Controverſies and infallible, but admitting that for truth, he muſt prove that I
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40740:211"/> without reaſon claim this right of judicature, and this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and onely for the <hi>Roman,</hi> ſtill underſtanding by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, all Churches which ſubmit themſelves to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as to their ſupreme Paſtor.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That then which remaineth here to be proved I did prove and ſtill do prove thus, the Proteſtant Church and all other Churches different from the <hi>Roman,</hi> do judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, acknowledge themſelves, declare and profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be fallible, and that according to infallible Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If then any of theſe Churches be infallible (in what they judge, and declare for truth grounded in Scripture) they are infallible in this their judging and delaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be fallible. Therefore infallibly they are fallible. Therefore, upon ſuppoſition that it hath been formerly proved that ſome Church is judge of Controverſies, and Infallible, and it being by the former argument demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively proved that neither the Proteſtant Church, nor any Church different from the <hi>Roman</hi> can be judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and infallible, it evidently followes that only the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church is this judge and is infallible as ſhe teacheth her ſelfe to be. Here you exclaim <hi>at my abuſing others by ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> which notwithſtanding, I confidently ſay you could not, nor cannot ſolve. Therefore prehaps you are pleaſed to wonder and then gibe at my argument, as if I only argued thus. <hi>The Roman Church claimeth infallibility, therefore by claiming of it ſhe hath right to it.</hi> This argument you may freely ſcoff at, it is nothing like mine. And yet in undoing this fond argument you only buſie your ſelfe and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I preſſed and ſtill preſſe, that the Church which is apointed by God for infallible judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, cannot poſſible be any of thoſe Churches which teach themſelves not to be this infallible judge. It had bin very eaſie to have underſtood this right and not to make me ſay, that only laying claim to infallibility is a ſufficient proof of infallibility. It is a very different thing to ſay, <hi>He that muſt
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40740:211"/> be a Miniſter muſt be a Man and not a Woman,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>ſuch an one muſt needs be a Miniſter becauſe he is a man and not a Woman.</hi> So it is one thing to ſay, <hi>the Church which is the infallible judge muſt be a Church, judging and teaching her ſelfe to be infallible and cannot be a Church which judgeth and teaches her ſelfe fallible;</hi> And another thing to ſay, <hi>that that Church is infallibly judge which teacheth her ſelfe to be ſo.</hi> This I ſaid not, but I ſaid, <hi>that Church that muſt be infallible muſt not want this condition,</hi> and therefore no Church teaching her ſelfe (even according to Scripture) to be fallible, can truly be this infallible judge. Againſt my argument truly related, you have not one word, without you think you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me by ſaying, <hi>that no Church of Chriſt is infallible,</hi> and therefore <hi>not the Roman. But</hi> Sir did not you alwayes hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtill importunely call upon me to prove that <hi>even upon ſuppoſition,</hi> that the Church was our judge and Infallible, that theſe great prerogatives belonged to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> You bid me ſtill prove this even <hi>ſtanding upon the ſuppoſition,</hi> that ſome Church was judge and infallible. Is it then any thing like a Scholar like anſwer to return no other anſwer to my argument but by now ſaying the ſuppoſition is not true, the truth of which, <hi>though allowed,</hi> you contended to be nothing to my purpoſe. If you will grant me that, if any Church be judge of Controverſies and infallible, this is our Church I have done. Neither intend I any thing elſe in this chapter.</p>
            <p n="3">3 You bring an argument to prove our Church fallible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe either it erred in admitting, or in rejecting the <hi>Millenary opinion</hi> before admitted. Sir I call upon you to prove that ever our infallible Judge (that is the ſupreme Paſtor of the Church defining with the Church aſſembled in a Council) did admit of the <hi>Millinary opinion.</hi> If this be not done you prove not our Iudge to be fallible and this I am ſure can never be proved. Yea it cannot be proved that the Church diffuſed or Univerſal, did at any one age unanimouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this doctrine for a point of faith. For when this
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40740:212"/> opinion began to get much ground, divers of the Fathers did oppoſe it. Even S. <hi>Juſtin (Dialogo cum Triphone circa medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um)</hi> whom yours uſe ſo commonly to alledge for this opinion, in plain words telleth you, <hi>Multos, qui purae piaeque ſunt Chriſtianorum ſententia hoc non agnoſcere. That many (note</hi> the word <hi>many) who are of a pure and pious Chriſtian opinion do not acknowledge this.</hi> And your own learned Doctor <hi>Ha</hi> in <hi>bis view of &amp;c. Page</hi> 87. 88, 89. doth prove the weaknes of that place in St. <hi>Iuſtin</hi> not to conclude any thing againſt Catholike Tradition. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> will tell you L. 3. C. 21. that <hi>Papias</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> was the firſt author of this opinion. The traditions of the Church have no firſt authors but the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of my 28th. Number.</note>Wherefore by all you have hitherto ſaid, my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remaineth unanſwered and is really unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſuppoſition being admitted upon which it is ſpoken. For tell me whether any Church, which teacheth her ſelf to be fallible can be truely infallible. If any ſuch Church can be infallible, and all Churches be ſuch but the Roman, then Chriſt can have no Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth to be our infallible Judge but the Roman. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no tollerable Anſwer being yet given to this argument, I will be as good as my word when I ſaid in this Number, <hi>That this being a demonſtration I ſhould hold my ſelf bound to ſay no more until this argument were anſwered.</hi> Here then I end: yet when you ſhall have ſolved this argument, I ſhal be ready to make good my promiſe concerning what I ſaid I could and would ſhew of the Roman Church to ſoon as I ſhould ſee this argument anſwered.</p>

            <p>Par. 2. <hi>To ſhew the neceſſity of treating the matter I had undertaken I ſaid, that ſuch a manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scripture as is permitted by you to all ſorts of people with ſo unlimited a licenſe to interpret them according to their own private judgement of diſcretion is a thing moſt apt to cauſe a numberleſſe number of ſects and hereſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. Conſider with your ſelf whether you deale honeſtly with us in reporting our opinion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Do I, or any of us, give ſuch unlimited licenſe to interpret them according to their own private judgment or diſcretion?</p>
            <p>But this was neceſſary for your turn, that ſo you might make your argument better: and therefore, when you ſaw by my anſwer that your reading of the Scripture freely permitted to the people is not of it ſelf guilty of thoſe effects, you now add that which is falſe, that <hi>we give ſuch unlimited licenſe to all ſorts of people to interpret the Scripture according<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to their private judgement of diſcretion.</hi> Now chuſe you which you will ſtand to; that in your Treatiſe, or this in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and then put it into form of diſcourſe; and we
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:40740:215"/> anſwer you. If you ſay, as in the Treatiſe, <hi>that if there were a free permitting of the uſe of the Bible to all ſorts of people in their mother tongue, it would not fail, but multitudes of new ſects and hereſies would grow up; and as for the peoples manners, they would daily grow worſe and worſe:</hi> then we deny your propoſition, as before, underſtanding it in way of cauſe, or if you will hold it of us in this anſwer, that we do freely permit to all ſorts of people <hi>to interpret the Scripture accor-to their private judgement of diſcretion,</hi> we deny your aſſumption, for though we allow the judgement of private diſcretion negatively, that nothing ſhould be obtruded upon us for point of faith which we ſee not in our judgment of diſcretion to be agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: yet do we not give any licenſe to any poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to interpret according to the judgement of private diſcretion, but according to the analogy of faith, and alſo we commend to them the peruſal of the judgment of others, Fathers and Doctors, in points of difficulty, private judgment herein makes not the interpretation; but is to make conſent to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. we can diſtinguiſh of your predicate here <hi>[is a thing moſt apt to cauſe a numberleſſe number of ſects and hereſies]</hi> There is a double aptitude either in the nature of the thing, or by accident of our corruption.

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:40740:215"/> might ſay much: firſt, there is ſomewhat in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which we do not in their propriety affirme, as namely, that they are to take the Scripture for the <hi>ſole and onely Judge in all neceſſary controverſies:</hi> we ſay properly and formally, Scripture is not the judge, but as the Law and rule by which judgement is to be given in controverſies neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not allow him to make a <hi>review of what is decreed in a Generall Councell</hi> as in order to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but onely for himſelf. He hath no autoritative judgement reſpecting others; but a rationall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſpecting himſelf. So you ſay that of us which we do not ſay. And then again, you will not ſay of us that which we do ſay, which ſhould ſpoyle the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: for though we ſay he may not (for he cannot) ſubmit his judgement to a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, unleſſe he ſees what is determined thereby to be true, yet may he ſubmit his perſon unto cenſure, and ſo not oppoſe the Church Repreſentative. Again 3. In this your Argument you do not conclude home; for you conclude, this is but to <hi>leave men in a mighty hazard of miſunderſtanding the word of God and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into hereſie.</hi> So then, upon the whole matter, this argumentation of yours is not good; becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it, nay, much is denied; and ſomewhat not by you allowed, as it ſhould be: and then it concludes but accidentally; if probably, not neceſſarily; if neceſſarily, not demonſtratively; if demonſtratively, not <hi>a priori;</hi> for it doth not, by way of a certain effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe, induce the concluſion of hereſie; nor is hereſie the finall cauſe of our intending this liberty to the people. Therfore be not ſo forward in high termes of your ratiocination. Yea, if this allowance to the people did certainly, and by way of Emanation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hereſie, it would not of it ſelf produce any more than materiall hereſie in points of neceſſary faith
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:40740:216"/> which need not be brought into queſtion) not hereſie formal, which imports oppoſition to the Church. And this reſpect of hereſie you do ſurely bend the bow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Indeed every oppoſition doth import diſcent: but every diſcent (which is more generall) doth not actually import an oppoſition.</p>
            <p>So your long ſillogiſme <hi>a priori</hi> is but lanke, nor doth your reaſoning <hi>a poſteriori</hi> thrive: thus, <hi>In thoſe places where the ſacred Scriptures are thus proſtituted, not only to the bare reading, but alſo to the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every profane and ignorant fellow (I ſtill meane when he ſhall have heard or ſeen what can be alleadged on all ſides) theſe and only theſe ſects have multiplied, and do multiply, beyond meaſure.</hi> Anſ. If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be allowed to every ones uſe for the knowledge of things neceſſary to ſalvation, it is no proſtitution of it. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as before in his 1. <hi>b. c.</hi> 1. <hi>de Verbo Dei,</hi> affirms it to be our rule, then a rule to all; then it is neceſſary by neceſſity of precept, and by neceſſity of mean too, upon the account of a rule: if you ſpeak of a proſtitution of it to every ones interpretation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own fanſy. This is not intended by us. But what power hath the Church to hinder them of their right? If they abuſe their liberty, it is upon their own perill. They wreſt the Scripture to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid of ſome, that they wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome things in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles which are hard to be underſtood. And as <hi>Dominion</hi> Civill is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in grace ſpeciall: ſo neither is the religious right of Scripture grounded in ſpeciall knowledge. And if they be more ignorant, they have more need of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The parentheſis you adde to ſtrengthen your argument or to qualifie the ſtate of your queſtion, makes nothing for you. For if you underſtand the words <hi>[I ſtill meane when he ſhall have heard or ſeen what can be alleadged on all ſides]</hi> as to ſtrengthen your
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:40740:216"/> Argument, it ſurely weakens it. For if they heare or ſee what is alleadged on all ſides, they are not like to follow their own conceit, but what appears to be more reaſonable. For your argument ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that after they have heard or ſeen all that can be ſaid on all ſides, yet they have liberty from us to interpret according to their own pleaſure; which is more unlikely they would do, though they had our allowance after they had heard or ſeen all that could be alleadged on all ſides. If you intend thoſe words to qualify the ſtate of the queſtion, then it ſeems before they do hear or ſee what is alleadged on all ſides they may not paſſe any judgement of the point for themſelves: and if they muſt firſt heare or ſee all that can be alleadged on all ſides before they take that ſenſe that is agreeable to plain places of Scripture, then ſurely they muſt be blind as to this point; for, when ſhall they be able probably to know whether they have heard or ſeen all that can be alleadged on all ſides in ſuch a matter? This is ſuch a yoke which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (if we may ſay ſo) lay upon us which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear. But, 3. Whereas you ſay theſe and only theſe ſects have multiplied &amp; do multiply beyond meaſure, it is falſe on both parts; (not theſe always which you muſt mean) for why then did the ancient Fathers exhort the people ſo much to the ſtudy of the Scripture, as <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the former in his Catechiſm, the later in his Comments, and alſo in homilies? And then not <hi>only there;</hi> for then you might propoſe a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient way to take away all the differences amongſt the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> and thoſe that divide from the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> namely, by taking away all uſe of Scripture. You ſee, not only by ignorant and profane men, there are bred differences where the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is in liberty; but amongſt the learned men alſo.
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:40740:217"/> So that not always theſe, nor only theſe, <hi>theſe are ſects.</hi> But 4. The multiplying of ſects, and beyond meaſure, is not, as hath been ſaid, the effect of the uſe thereof; becauſe not neceſſary. And doth not your argument follow by conſequence only? then not by neceſſity of conſequent. And therefore is not this a demonſtration <hi>a poſteriori?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have argued <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> let us now ſee how happy you are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in refutation of my anſwers.</p>
            <p>This we have in the third par. <hi>Neither do any of your arguments prove this not to be the true cauſe of hereſie and bad life, which followeth hereſie.</hi> Anſ. Here we ſee you intended a full demonſtration from the cauſe. But whereas you ſay none of my arguments do prove the contrary; you may remember that I had no arguments but in way of anſwer. It is not my office to diſpute but anſwer. Whereas you ſay b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d life fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth hereſy; that you meane inſeparably, do you not? If you do not, it is inconſequent; if you do, it is falſe. How many Hereticks have been more ſtrict in their lives then orthodox Chriſtians, that they might gaine more credit to their error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by holineſſe of life as <hi>Socinus</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>You come then to refute my arguments. <hi>Firſt it is ſo far from being contrary from that text, you err, not knowing the Scriptures, that it is moſt agreeable to it. For a moſt fit way to erre againſt the knowledge of the Scripture is to permit ſuch and a great number of ſuch men to interpret Scriptures, as are moſt fit to erre in the interpretation of them.</hi> And is this a good refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And therefore the meaning of our Saviour muſt be according to your uſe, they erred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have the knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they miſ-interpreted Shift you how you will you cannot evade, was the knowledge of
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:40740:217"/> the Scriptures the cauſe of their error? no: that is contrary to our Saviour, who ſaid, you err, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures: was it neceſſary that thoſe who did know the Scriptures ſhould miſ-interpret them? no; for then that will, by a recideration, come into the ſame inconvenience; for then the knowledge will be a certain mean (at leaſt in a large ſenſe) of this miſ-interpretation. And ſo it would be our beſt way to know nothing of Scripture, that ſo we may not err. 3. Can we imagine that our Saviour Chriſt diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as you do, that becauſe by our fault the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are an occaſion of miſ-interpretation, therefore the people ſhould not commonly uſe them? is this ſymbolicall to the ſenſe of our Saviour's words, you err, not knowing the Scriptures? 4. Our Saviour then by you rebukes their miſ-interpretation: then he would have them know the Scriptures better, not have the people deprived of them. 5. There is a double knowledge as to this purpoſe. 1. An habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Knowledge, which is chiefly of the Principles in Scripture; this they had in their mind. Then there is an actuall Knowledge, which conſiſts in an application of thoſe Principles to particular Concluſions of belief and practiſe. They were wanting it ſeems in the later; in that they did not ſo as they ſhould conſider that text in <hi>Moſes,</hi> which our Saviour makes uſe of for the Reſurrection. They might have inferred the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from that text, and ſo not have erred. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had they more need to look over the Scriptures again and conſider them better. The ſaying of the Jew is good. He that reads a book an hundred times is not like him that readeth it an hundred times and one. The oftner we read it, eſpecially the Bible, the more we ſee in it.</p>
            <p>But you bring a corroboration of your anſwer, <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being licenſed to croſs all Antiquity and all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:40740:218"/> of the Church if they ſtand in their way.</hi> Sir, this will not do. 1. We licence them not to croſſe all Antiquity, &amp; we need not give them ſuch a direction, and ſurely if they ſhould you would have no cauſe to blame them. We have liberty to uſe that of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in his Rhet. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Do you look to that who contradict God and Fathers and Doctors. 2. They cannot intend ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the croſſing of all Antiquity; for certainly they do not know all Antiquity; yea, if you ſpeak <hi>all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> with a full univerſality, there are few of your own learned men that know it. And therefore if any of their interpretations doth croſſe antiquity, it doth but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it is but by accident. And in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they are not ſo like to do ſo. 3. Who is there of all your men that have proved this propoſition, that the Conſent of the Fathers (ſuppoſed) makes an argument of Divine Faith, therefore though we love their company, yet we deſire to ſee our way. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to us nothing but that which is proper. How ſhall your men know that what they hold doth not croſſe all Antiquity? The Authority of the Church gives them neither faith of it nor Knowledge. Yea ſome of yours ſay, <hi>omnes Patres ſic, ego autem non ſic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You go on. <hi>And I wonder why you call this your manner of proceeding the knowledge of the Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> unto ſecondly. Anſ. You make your ſelf ſport with the Ambiguity of the word <hi>Knowledge.</hi> You mean it by way of a Science, as Phyſick: we do not ſay that Trades-men make any knowledge of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo, as to give an account of the principles of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the body of it: no, but they may have a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Scripture ſufficient for their uſe, although they do not teach others. As if there were plain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Phyſick in our language; we might make uſe
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:40740:218"/> them for our ſelves, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſaid, after thirty years of age he would laugh at thoſe who did need a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, you are deceived then, or would deceive in the fallacie of conſequent, though all Science be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, all knowledge is not Science; for knowledge is more generall and therefore ſurely of it ſelf doth not inferre the moſt perfect ſpecies.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>ſecondly, you in vaine object that of St. Paul that the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. unto thirdly; wherein you allow the truth of the text with your gloſs; namely, not as they are <hi>interpreted by every giddy fanſie,</hi> but by Tim. <hi>who did continue in the things which he learned and had been aſſured of by orall tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; what will you get by this anſwer? If you underſtand by orall tradition ſuch doctrines of the Goſpell which were firſt preached, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards written, we grant you the uſe of ſuch orall traditions: but this boots you not; for you muſt have traditions in point of faith, beſides what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: and ſuch we deny unto you that <hi>Timothy</hi> had. And I prove my deniall by your own words. For how could <hi>Timothy</hi> underſtand Scripture by what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Scripture? you ſpeake of his underſtanding the Scripture by tradition: tradition, of proper name, is that which is beſide Scripture in the matter of it: and how can he, by that which is different in matter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scripture? If you mean by orall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome traditive interpretations (as learned men call them) of the more difficult paſſages of Scripture, this indeed were more reaſonable in the hypotheſis as to <hi>Timothy:</hi> but this is nothing to us, unleſſe you can tell us certainly how many and what they are. If there were ſuch, and loſt, then your Church is loſt. 2. Againe, we allow no giddy fanſie to define the ſenſe of Scripture; but in things neceſſary and plain
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:40740:219"/> their own knowledge may be ſufficient, and their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgement may be as ſafely exerciſed in the ſence thereof as in the choice of your Religion.</p>
            <p>But thirdly by your own words, I will conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you <hi>a fortiori;</hi> for if the Scriptures were able to make <hi>Timothy</hi> wiſe, who was a Teacher, much more others: ſince, as Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> and you afterwards affirm, there is more requiſite to a Miniſter to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved than others. If then they be able to make a Miniſter wiſe unto ſalvation, then one of the People much more, who, according to you, is not bound to ſo much. Fourthly, whereas you ſay, <hi>They</hi> (ſo) <hi>will make him wiſe unto ſalvation, and to continue ſtill aſſured of the doctrine of the Church, and never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that.</hi> Do not you ſee that you add to <hi>Paul</hi> in the Predicate: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, they are able to make him wiſe unto ſalvation: and you ſay, [ſo] they are able to make him wiſe to ſalvation, and to continue ſtill aſſured of the Doctrine of the Church, and not to contradict the Church: who is it that wreſts Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now? Do not you draw it to your own uſe? no, you will ſay; it is all one to make us wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to make us continue ſtill aſſured of the Doctrine of the Church, and not to contradict the Church. Is it? then all who have not contradicted the Church are ſaved: &amp; none that have contradicted the Church are ſaved. The former you will not ſay: the later you cannot prove. Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> contradicted the Church in the 5. Gen. Council, about the three Chapters; was he damned? Fifthly, you ſay, the Scriptures ſo underſtood, would make him wiſe unto ſalvation, and to continue in the doctrine of the Church. How do you underſtand it, copulatively, or disjunctively? Copulatively, that the Scriptures and the orall traditions would make him wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to continue in the doctrine of the Church? or disjunctively, that the Scriptures would make him
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:40740:219"/> wiſe unto ſalvation, and the traditions to continue in the doctrine of the Church? If disjunctively, then we may be wiſe unto ſalvation, and yet not continue in the doctrine of the Church; to wit, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If we cannot have ſalvation without continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, then prove your Church to be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible to us, as the Doctors of the Church were to <hi>Timothy,</hi> until that time you will be thought to beg the queſtion. So, to end this anſwer, we note here, that you take ſpecial care of the Church. It ſeems by your ſtickling about the Church, that what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, in his <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> concerning <hi>Rome</hi>-Heathen, is alſo true by you of <hi>Rome</hi>-Chriſtian, <hi>Et major cura unius Romae quam totius Coeli:</hi> And there is more care had of one <hi>Rome</hi> than all Heaven. You go on. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you ſay; <hi>You confeſs that when we are by the Church aſſured that the Scripture is the Word of God, we may ground our faith in it for thoſe things which are plainly delivered.</hi> You ſay <hi>yes, but I alſo ſay, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are not plainly delivered in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, it ſeems you come downe from your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer univerſality, that whatſoever we do believe, we muſt believe upon the propoſals of the Church, as the formal cauſe and motive thereof; and why then do you not allow the people the uſe of the Bible, as in order to thoſe things which are plainly delivered? So that by this conceſſion you open the way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict your own practice.</p>
            <p>But you would ſhut it again, by ſaying, that <hi>all things neceſſary to ſalvation are not plainly delivered in it.</hi> Be ſure you take heed of this, that you do not grant this: for why then ſhould all fly to the Church for infalible directions in way of ſupply? well. Are they not delivered, or not plainly? which? ſpeak your mind. If not delivered, then ſurely not
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:40740:220"/> plainly; for of that which is not there are no affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as the Rule is; but they may be delivered, and yet not plainly. Come out of the clouds, and do not make a noiſe, but lighten us. If not delivered, think upon the Argument you know well, <hi>If many things not neceſſary are plainly delivered in Scripture, then much rather all things neceſſary.</hi> If delivered and not plainly, then plainly not delivered; for if they be delivered, they are delivered for our uſe, as a Rule of faith and action: and how are they a Rule, if they be not ſufficiently plain? for then we muſt have another Rule for the underſtanding of this Rule. And alſo think upon the former Argument, which proceeds upon your own diſtinction, that the Scriptures were able to make <hi>Timothy</hi> wiſe unto ſalvation, but not every one. If <hi>Timothy,</hi> then much more others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more is required, as you ſay, to a Miniſter, in point of belief, than to others.</p>
            <p>But you would prove what you ſay <hi>S. Peter ſaith, that many, to their perdition, did miſunderſtand ſome hard places of S. Paul; ſo that miſ-interpretation of hard places may be the cauſe of perdition.</hi> Anſ. Firſt you will excuſe us if we note that the danger they were in, was not by miſunderſtanding, but by wreſting of thoſe places. You know the Greek is, as before was ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And the Syriack renders it, <hi>perverting, depraving:</hi> and ſo alſo your Tranſlation of <hi>Rhemes, depraving.</hi> This is not ſo much an intellectual error, as a moral fault, and the danger is by the later. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Here's but ſome things hard to be underſtood in S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles, not all; not many: and from hence you cannot argue, that all things therefore in S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles, and much leſſe in the whole Scripture, are hard to be underſtood. If you ſyllogize ſo, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>a particulari, &amp; a dicto ſecundum quid.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the perverting and depraving doth more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:40740:220"/> depend upon their being unſtable than igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Therefore cannot you impute that to ſimple ignorance, which, at leaſt partly belongs to another cauſe. Fourthly, how prove you that thoſe things which were hard to be underſtood, were of thoſe things which are neceſſary to ſalvation? If you ſay ſo, it lies upon you to prove it; if they were not ſuch, then this text is not pertinent. Fifthly, it is to their own deſtruction, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So then it ſeems hereby they had the liberty to read thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles: and why ſhould you therefore hinder the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the uſe of <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſince they run the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their own deſtruction by wreſting them? And peruſe your own <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon the place, who doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly note, that it is not ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as referring to the Epiſtle (as ſome copies he ſaid would have it) but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, referring to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which reſpects the time of Chriſts coming; although afterwards <hi>Estius</hi> would extend them to the point of juſtification by faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, you object hereſie and lewd life to ſome in whom you ſay we invested infallibility. If I ſhould grant all, what prove you from hence, but that there be other ways to hereſie and bad life beſides giving all ſcope to interpret the Scriptures as we judge fit? &amp;c.</hi> unto <hi>but to prevent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. But do you remember what occaſion I had to object this to you by way of recrimination? you char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us by the judgement of your learned Divines that the free uſe of the Scripture would be <hi>it upon which the peoples manners would grow worſe and worſe.</hi> And to this I ſaid, how comes it then to paſſe that ſome in whom you veſted infallibilitie were guiltie of hereſie and bad manners? and I inſtanced in <hi>Liberius</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing againſt <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> So that the way your Church hath doth not free you from theſe crimes: and therefore you do unreaſonably urge againſt your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:40740:221"/> inconveniences of his principles, which are common to yours. And yet you will now complain of me becauſe I am even with you.</p>
            <p>The debate betwixt us upon this point lies thus; you faulted our permiſſion of the uſe of Scripture to the people as the cauſe, or the cauſe without which hereſie and bad manners do not ariſe. I anſwered in defence of Scripture, this not the cauſe nor the <hi>cauſa ſine quae non</hi> of them, ſince hereſie and bad manners have been in thoſe of your Church in whom your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falibility is placed, and therefore have you no cauſe to take it ſo ill that I anſwered you ſo home. All the cauſality you can pretend of hereſie and bad manners by a free uſe of the Scriptures, is through miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of them; is it not? yea? is it ſo? then how come thoſe who are infalible to be hereticks and bad? You had beſt take away Scripture from all, that ſo there may be no hereſie.</p>
            <p>Well, it ſeems you now begin to bethink your ſelf that hereſie and bad life are not the properties of a free uſe of Scripture, as we underſtand them <hi>quarto modo;</hi> but as conſequents, or inſeparable accidents w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are in a larger ſenſe as properties, namely, as <hi>omni ſed non ſoli;</hi> ſo I conſtrue your laſt words <hi>[if I ſhould grant all, what prove you from hence but that there be other ways to hereſie and bad life]</hi> &amp;c. you muſt then allow us to tell you, that you are ſomewhat diſpoſed to go hence, and to deduct and refute the overboiling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the danger of Scripture, as to the people at leaſt as if all the hereſies and bad life were to be grounded or charged upon the common liberty of reading Scripture. And let me come up a little more cloſely to you; I demand of you Whether you will or dare to ſay, that all thoſe who have had the free uſe of Scripture have interpreted it [in difficult pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces] as they judged fit, and therefore were of bad life:
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:40740:221"/> if not then, is it not <hi>proprium omni?</hi> And ſo for, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, you cannot ſay, that every one who hath freely uſed Scripture hath interpreted or miſ-interpreted it unto hereſie, for how then could he of your Church ſay, <hi>ſi fides in doctos ſolos caderet, nihil eſſet, occuperius Deo?</hi> Or did they believe without the uſe of Scripture by an implicit faith in the Church? Did they? But this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith implies a contradiction <hi>in adjecto,</hi> for faith ſuppoſeth knowledge of what we believe in the object, though not in the reaſon: but implicit is divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt knowledge: and if you ſay, that it knows the Church which it doth believe, it will come to this, that all the faith of the people ſhall be ſhrunk into one Article of the Church; and no matter whether they explicitly believe God or Chriſt or any thing elſe, will this prove good Divinity? Or will good Divinity prove this? And beſides, it is not implicit faith which believes the Church, but explicit; for they muſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believe the Roman Church to be it unto which ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is obliged. Then reading of the Scriptures is not a cauſe to all, though not all the cauſe of hereſie; for ſome have got ſalvation by it; and therefore were no hereticks, unleſs you will ſay, they might have ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and be hereticks too. If you will ſay it, then why would you perſwade our people that there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us hereticks? Then ſubjection to the Roman Church is not neceſſary to ſalvation; for although all Chriſtians but you, according to your Principles, are hereticks, yet they may be ſaved becauſe hereticks may be ſaved. However we may have faith by reading of Scripture; and if faith, then we are not hereticks, by <hi>Knots</hi> argumentation; becauſe he would have he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie deſtroy all faith. But you have reaſon to ſay that other ways of hereſie there may be beſides being converſant in Scripture: for you know that hereticks have pleaded Antiquity, therefore by your Logick,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:40740:222"/> you ſhould not plead it for uſe and ſettlement of faith.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>Again, had not David who was a Murtherer and an Adulterer; had not Solomon who was an Idolater the infalible aſſistance of the Holy Ghost, in writing ſeverall parts of the holy Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I thank you for helping your weak Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for this makes for me, and proves for me what I ſaid on behalf of Scripture, that hereſie and badneſſe were accidentall at moſt to the uſe of Scripture, becauſe thoſe whom you account infallible were guilty thereof. You prove now, by other examples, the poſſibility thereof. The ſenſe of the diſcourſe, as to badneſſe of life, is this. If bad manners be competible to thoſe who are accounted infallible, then the miſ-interpretation of Scripture, by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the people, is not the cauſe of bad maners, but <hi>verum prius;</hi> and now you, not denying it to be true of your Pope, would confirm it by certain examples in Scripture. But I hope you meane to reflect this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the proof of infalibility to be conſiſtent with a lewd life. And therefore I anſwer to you that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not the diſtinction of infalibility <hi>in rebus fidei,</hi> and not in point of action. I deny not the diſtinction in the notion of it, but I deny it in the application of it to the Pope. I do acknowledge him in one part of it, falible, in the latter; but you muſt prove him infalible in the former, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> was: and we have done. We are agreed in the <hi>Theſis,</hi> that there may be infalibility of faith where there is lewdneſs of life, but we differ in the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> as you intend it; not that the Pope may not be nought in life: but that he is not infalible in defining points of faith or manners.</p>
            <p>But you would avoid the danger of my former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; therefore you ſay, <hi>But to prevent this and all that elſewhere you can ſay againſt the Pope: I (in my twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:40740:222"/> firſt number) deſired you and all to take notice of that which you here quite forget. I ſaid I would have every one to know that the Roman Church doth oblige us no more than to believe that the Pope, defining with a lawfull Councell, cannot erre. How then doth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or faith of a Church (I ſpeake not of private mens private opinions) inveſt infalibility in a perſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall or bad?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then let my anſwer be put into this forme. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> the Pope was guilty of hereſie and bad manners. <hi>Liberius</hi> was (according to you) infalible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Subject of infalibility may be an heretick, and guiltie of bad manners, and conſequently he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and bad life are not to be imputed to the miſ-interpretation of Scripture. Before you graunted me the Concluſion, that hereſie and bad life may come in otherwiſe; and therefore we cannot faſten them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the miſ-interpretation of Scripture: and now you denie to me the Aſſumption, and you ſay the Church doth not inveſt infalibility in the Pope, <hi>but as defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a lawfull Councell,</hi> generall you meane.</p>
            <p>Well then, <hi>Liberius</hi> is not defended in the point of ſubſcription as neither you nor <hi>Bellarmin</hi> can defend him: but yet you defend the Roman infalibility in faith; becauſe, as you ſay, he was not the Subject of it. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than infalibilitie ſhould be diſparaged, the Pope ſhall be degraded from his infalibilitie.</p>
            <p>This you ſay here occaſionally, to denie unto me the uſe of this inſtance: but this is not the ſeat of the matter; therefore we ſhall ſay here no more than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie. And firſt you had no great cauſe here to except againſt the aſſumption, ſince you grant the conſequence of the Concluſion. 2. You ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you ſay, that the Pope of himſelf is not the Subject of infalibilitie, for by this you raiſe a war againſt you of your Roman Catholicks, which did
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:40740:223"/> think they knew the ſenſe of the Roman faith, as well as you; for ſure you are not more than a private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. All the Canoniſts you know are againſt you, and the Jeſuites are againſt you, particularly <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his 2 <hi>b. de Concil. Autor</hi> 15. <hi>Ch.</hi> Where he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines this poſition, that the Pope is the Head of the whole Church. Where he hath this argument. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia univerſalis est unum corpus viſibile, ergo habere debet unum Caput viſibile.</hi> The univerſall Church is one viſible Bodie; therefore it muſt have one viſible Head, otherwiſe it will ſeem a Monſter. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagin any other but the Pope. Therefore the Pope is the Head of the whole Church <hi>ſimul</hi> together; ſo he, and that is of a Councill. And ſo it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councill. Now where ſhall be the infalibilitie of the Church placed then but in the head of a councill? You are all wont to ſay, that the Church is infalible and a Councel infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and that the Pope is infalible. Now how will you com-promiſe the truth of theſe, but by ſaying the Church is infallible by the Councill and the Councell by the Pope. Then the Pope is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of this infalibilitie. The Church formally taken is the multitude of the Faithfull; the Church repreſentative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Councell, the Church virtually is the Pope. If the firſt ſubject receptive of Autority be the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then do you lay the ground of the Independents: if the Councill, then the Pope hath his power from them, and ſo he is not the immediate Vicar of Chriſt, as <hi>Bell.</hi> in the former <hi>b.</hi> and <hi>ch.</hi> the 15.</p>
            <p>And then alſo what will become of the condition of the primitive Church wherein there was ſo long a time before any General Councel? And then alſo in reaſon there ſhould be a General ſtanding Councel, if infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility primarily flows from them. And have the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil a coordinate power, or ſubordinate? Which will
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:40740:223"/> you ſay? If coordinate, then to be ſure the Pope is not Head of the Church, which you will be loath to ſay. If ſubordinate, then he is Head, and therefore infalibility muſt be ſubjected in him as Prince of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will divide infalibilitie from Authority. And if ſo, what Autoritie will there be of this infalibilitie?</p>
            <p>But to go on. You tell me that thoſe <hi>Doctors who are of that opinion that the Pope cannot erre in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of a general Councel, have other anſwers to your objections.</hi> So you put me to ſeek for their anſwers. You will not tell me who they are, nor what they are, nor where they are to be found. So then as to them my objections are proper; and their opinions may be as probable or more than yours, and it may ſeem more and therefore you will not condemne your own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by comparing with their anſwers: for if their Anſwers be ſolid, then your opinion is nought.</p>
            <p>And then you are pleaſed to put me off thus, <hi>but that which you ſay is nothing againſt our faith, which no man (though never ſo little a French-man) will ſay obligeth us to hold the Pope infallible in defining out of a Generall Councell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. But that which you ſay is nothing againſt the faith of others which no man (though never ſo little a Courtier at <hi>Rome</hi>) will ſay obligeth them to hold the Pope not infalible in defining out of a general Councel. But why do you ſay our faith? Is your faith the ſame with the faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court? If not, then you divide from them. If ſo, then you muſt hold that none are true Catholicks (in your ſenſe) but thoſe who hold themſelves ſuch by Subjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> not as in a Councell, but ſimply to him. Yea, do you not think that you muſt neceſſarily be ſubject to the <hi>Laterean</hi> Councill which had the Popes conſent: and that determined the thing <hi>expreſſiſſime,</hi> as <hi>Bel.</hi> in his ſecond <hi>b. de Concil. cap.</hi> 13. Namely, that
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:40740:224"/> the Pope is above the Councel in a ſenſe oppoſite to the Counſell of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Baſill</hi> who defined a Generall Councell above the Pope, and could infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly determine without him. And if you ſay that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armin</hi> ſaid, there ſome did doubt whether the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Councell was a generall Councell, yet you muſt tell us your opinion what you hold of this Councel; yea, in his ſeventeenth ch. he defends it for a generall Councel and holds the point to be a decree concerning faith, but ſaies it is a doubt that the Councell did not decree it <hi>proprie ut decretum fide Catholicae tenendum;</hi> and therefore they that think otherwiſe are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hereticks, yet canot be excuſed from great teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. However I hope that Councel was more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with you than the judgment of private Doctors: yea alſo, than the <hi>French Catholicks.</hi> Yea, if you will be a right <hi>French-man</hi> in this opinion, you ſhould hold that the Councell may be infalible <hi>reclamante Papa,</hi> (and this comes up to the ſtreſſe of the queſtion) and therefore you do not ſpeak determinately your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the right ſtate of the queſtion: but you do <hi>latere poſt principia,</hi> in ſaying, that no <hi>French-man</hi> will ſay, you are obliged to hold the Pope infalible in defining out a Generall Councell. If you be a <hi>French-man</hi> in this, ſpeak out and tell us your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not conjunctively, but disjunctively, whether the Councell may be infalible without the Pope. But I commend your wiſdome that you hold the ſafeſt way. For this <hi>Bellar.</hi> and all will ſay, that the Pope defining with a Councell cannot erre. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will alſo hold infalibilitie to be in the Pope, who is the head of the whole Church, even congregated, and that all Authoritie is in him, as the Monarch of the Church; but in this you are an Ephectick. So certainly you do agree amongſt your ſelves about the Capital point of the <hi>Roman</hi> infalibilitie. As one ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:40740:224"/> caſe of action: ſo may I ſay of you in this diſpute: you have firſt ſaid you knew not what: and now you know not what to ſay. Tell us where the originall of infalibilitie lies. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; ſurely it doth not become infalibilitie to be ſo reſerved.</p>
            <p>To paſſe this, you tell me in your fourth Par. that I lay to your charge the ſuppoſing of the queſtion. And I am ſtill of that minde. For if you ſay, <hi>that as things ſtand, we have no other aſſurance to ground our faith upon but the Church;</hi> you do plainly ſuppoſe that which is mainly in queſtion; and ſo muſt do until you prove it. And I ſtill ſay unto you, as I did, that you do not well conſider what you ſay in ſaying, <hi>as things ſtand,</hi> as if the rule of faith were a <hi>Lisbian</hi> rule, and might alter upon occaſions; and as if the Scripture muſt be accommodated to the uſe of the Church. Yes, <hi>intellectus currit cum praxi.</hi> And the Scripture is to follow the Church, and not the Church the Scripture, would you have it ſo? So it ſeems by what follows, for ſo you anſwer, that, <hi>though God might have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained otherwiſe, yet as things ſtand, the Church is the ground of our faith in all points, ſpeaking of the last ground on which we must ſtand; to wit, not an humane but Divine ground, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> And what do you ſay here more than you ſaid before; or more than we can ſay, <hi>mutatis mutandis?</hi> Though God could have ordained otherwiſe that there ſhould have been a ſtanding Councel, or a ſingular perſon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively infalible, to have propoſed and determined all things infalibly: yet, as things ſtand, the Scripture is the ground of our faith in all points neceſſary, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the laſt ground on which we muſt ſtand, not a humane, but a Divine ground. Wherein are we infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to you, but that we do not put in <hi>all points?</hi> But we put in all points neceſſarie. And what need more? And the Church is not yet proved to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:40740:225"/> any thing infalibly: the Scripture propoſeth all things neceſſary infalibly. And me thinks you ſhould, if you pleaſe, think the Scripture a divine ground rather than the Church.</p>
            <p>To take then your own principle.</p>
            <p>The ground of faith muſt be Divine.</p>
            <p>The Church is not a ground Divine.</p>
            <p>Therefore no ground.</p>
            <p>The Major is your own. The aſſumption is proved thus.</p>
            <p>The Teſtimonie of men is Humane.</p>
            <p>The Teſtimonie of the Church is the Teſtimonie of men. Therefore,</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition, in the ordinary capacity of <hi>men</hi> is plaine. For no effect can exceed the cauſe. And the ſecond propoſition is as plaine, if the men that are of the Church are conſidered as private men, by your own grounds. But theſe men you ſay, being in the capacitie of a Church, are inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt ſo as they cannot erre in any point. True, if they be aſſiſted with the Holy Ghoſt. Well, but how ſhall I know what a Church is, and whether ſuch men be of the Church; and whether ſuch men be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with the Holy Ghoſt? Yea, whether there be an Holy Ghoſt? All theſe particulars I muſt be ſatisfied in before that I can believe by a Divine faith, that what the Church propoſeth definitively, is true. A Church cannot be, in the nature of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed without a profeſſion of that Religion which directs man to his ſupernaturall end. Now this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion requires a ſupernaturall revelation, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſputes it in the begining of his <hi>Sums.</hi> Then this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion muſt be revealed, being not naturally intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either by principles or works of nature. Where, and how is this Religion revealed? you cannot ſay by the Church, for the queſtion is of the Church. And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:40740:225"/> how is it revealed that ſuch are of the Church, and aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, or that there is an Holy Ghoſt? Expedite theſe queſtions. And again, conſider, that S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and other Fathers have ſpoken freely of diſcerning the Church by Scripture; whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in I am informed what Religion is, what a Church, which the true Church, and that there is a Holy Ghoſt. Again, I muſt believe, by a divine faith, that the Church is the pillar and ground of truth, as you ſay. Well, but how ſhal I come by this divine faith? God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth it, you will ſay; well, but doth he infuſe it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as in reſpect of Scripture? So you muſt ſay; well then, cannot you think that he can infuſe faith of the Scripture immediately in reſpect of the Church? Anſwer me, is this faith wrought in me by the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, or not? if not, how? If ſo, then the Church is naturally <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the teſtimonie of the Church muſt be reſolved into the teſtimonie of men, <hi>extra rationem Eccleſiae,</hi> then is it of itſelf but humane. Therefore muſt you come to this, that the Teſtimonie of the Church is infallible by Athoritie of Scripture. Well then, if ſo, then <hi>the Church is not the laſt ground on which we muſt ſtand.</hi> Nor yet is it the firſt ground, as we take it for a Divine ground, which you mean; for it is not Divine but by the word of God: yea, if the Church be the laſt ground on w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we muſt ſtand, then why do you prove the Authority of the Church by the Authority of Scripture? And if you ſay, that you alſo prove the Scripture to be the word of God by the Church; yet not as the laſt ground, but the Church is reſolved into the Authoritie of Scripture as the laſt ground: for if the Church hath no being as ſuch, but by Scripture in the ſubſtance of it, then the Church muſt be ultimately grounded in Scripture; for that which is <hi>primum in generatione</hi> is <hi>ultimum in reſolutione.</hi> So <hi>a primo ad ultimum</hi> the Scripture is the ground of faith.</p>
            <pb n="538" facs="tcp:40740:226"/>
            <p>And ſo this will be contrary to what follows in your laſt, that we do not <hi>firſt believe the Church for the Scripture.</hi> If you ſpeak of a generall motive to believe the Scripture; ſo we may begin with the Church, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of credible men as towards humane faith: but if you ſpeak of belief as Divine, ſo we cannot firſt begin with the Church; becauſe we muſt firſt be aſſured of the Church by the word of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the formalitie of Divine faith; the word of God muſt be firſt <hi>in genere credibilium,</hi> unleſſe there were a reſultance of a Church out of naturall principles; which is not to be ſaid.</p>
            <p>And in your following words you intimate as much, as if we might firſt admit the Scripture to be the word of God, and then prove <hi>by the Scriptures the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church.</hi> If we may admit the Scriptures for Gods word firſt, then firſt the Scriptures may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be the word of God without the authority of the Church, which is contrary to what you have ſaid formerly. Then ſecondly, the Scripture muſt be the laſt ground of faith, becauſe, as before, that which is firſt in generation, is laſt in reſolution. And then thirdly. Why do you diſpute with us, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Authority of Scriptures by the Church, ſince we have admitted the Scriptures for the word of God? And therefore ſhould you not urge us to the acknowledgement of Scriptures by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church; but wholly to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Paragr. 5.</note>In the fifth Par. you ſay, <hi>you charge me with aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from my first propoſition, in which I ſaid, Divine faith in all things was cauſed by the propoſall of the Church, becauſe now I ſay, that when by the infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authoritie of the Church, we are aſſured that the Scripture is the word of God, we may believe ſuch things as are clearly contained in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="539" facs="tcp:40740:226"/>
            <p>Anſ. And I cannot yet bate you an ace of my charge. For your termes are of a believing (indefinitely) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propoſall of the Church; as if 'twere the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, formall cauſe of all faith: and ſo ſeverall of your Arguments would prove, that the Scripture is not at all our rule, but the Church. And this your firſt paper made to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. and therefore if you had clearly intended the diſpute of this point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are to believe the Scripture to be the word of God, by the Authoritie of the Church; and ſo conſequently, or cauſally, all to be believed for the Church, you ſhould have made this the ſtate of the main queſtion.</p>
            <p>But, now you ſay, when by the infalible Authoritie of the Church we are aſſured that the Scripture is the word of God, we may believe ſuch things as are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in Scripture. And do you not go leſſe now? Do but compare the quantities of your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before all things to be believed upon, and for the propoſall of the Church: now, ſome things may be believed for the Scripture, which are plainly contained in it. And the Church and the Scripture are in our caſe oppoſed: ſo then, if firſt all is to be believed by the Authoritie of the Church, and now, ſome things clearly contained may be believed upon Scripture, then do you not onely abate but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your ſelf in effect; for, it will come to this, all is to be believed upon the propoſal of the Church; &amp; ſomwhat may be believed not upon the propoſal of the Church, but of Scripture. For, when we are aſſured, you ſay, that the Scripture is the word of God, we may believe ſuch things as are plainly contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; then we are to believe it upon the account of the word of God. And your Church can have no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authoritie ſurely than God's word for it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you ſay we are to believe what is plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:40740:227"/> in Scripture (when we are aſſured by the Church, that it is the word of God) for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church, then I pray tell me why we ſhould believe the Church, if not for the word of God?</p>
            <p>Again, to conſider theſe words of yours; if we muſt be aſſured by infalible Authority of the Church that the Scripture is the word of God, before we can believe what is plainly contained therein, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of us muſt yeild upon the caſe of the infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the Church, or elſe nothing plainly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture can be, by your opinion, believed. But you think that ſome things are plainly ſet down in Scripture (though elſewhere, you would conclude as if all things in Scripture were obſcure; and ſo you now alſo abate in this) and herein we both agree: and we think the Church's Authority is not infalible: wherein we differ from you. Now which think you in reaſon ſhould yeild, you, or we? One would think you ſhould yeild rather: ſince we can prove, that whatſoever is contained in Scripture is to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without the Authoritie of the Church, and you cannot prove the Authority of the Church to be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in Scripture; yea, muſt yet believe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your principles, the infalible Authority of the Church, before you can believe it, though plainly contained in Scripture; becauſe, you muſt <hi>firſt be aſſured by the infalible Authoritie of the Church, that the Scripture is the word of God, before you do believe, what is contained in Scripture.</hi>

            <p>And again, thirdly, we are <hi>aſſured that the Scripture is the word of God;</hi> why may not we then have leave to <hi>believe things plainly contained in Scripture? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſunt in paucis,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith. We ſay, certain neceſſary truths are not ſo many. Why are not we then well grounded in Religion? ſurely in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe we do not go to divine faith, by your
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:40740:227"/> infalible Church. Even as the death of <hi>Remus,</hi> it was ordained by <hi>Romulus,</hi> that whoſoever went over the trench at the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> any other than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, ſhould be put to death: ſo,<note place="margin">

As if our faith were not true Divine faith, becauſe it is not implicit by the Church. Which is as much as to ſay, the obedience of faith is not good, becauſe it is not blind. And this is as much as to ſay, we do not ſee, becauſe we do not ſee.</p>
            <p>And therefore, fourthly, ſince, as hath been ſhewed, the authority of the Church is reſolved into Scripture; and ſince you have confeſſed, that we may admit the Scriptures to be the word of God, and yet may need to be aſſured of the Authoritie of the Church, your apologie for your ſelf, in this paragraph, muſt needs be inſufficient.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth Par. You begin with taking notice of my character of my ſelf to be one of the ſlender ſons of the Church of <hi>England, whether ſo, or whether he hath ſhewed that Treatiſe of mine to be no demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Let the indefferent reader, after the due pondering the force of all Arguments, determine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I dare not alter my ſmall opinion of my ſelf. And therefore the conſideration of ſuch matters ſhould have dropped from a judicious head into a learned pen. And if your demonſtration, as you call it, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch as doth merit the terme, you have proved me to be no better than my word. And if I prove it to be no demonſtration, I do not yet falſifie what I ſaid of my ſelf. For I ſhall impute the cauſe of it to our cauſe, the weakeſt hand may defend our cauſe: the ſtrongeſt cannot defend yours.</p>
            <p>To paſſe this, you go on. <hi>Sure I am that this is no Demonstration which you adde, the Scripture is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:40740:228"/> but the Church is not; therefore I muſt take for my ground the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. But you leave out the ſcope of this Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the formalitie of the concluſion. You ſpake of as <hi>clear a Demonſtration as any wiſe man can hope for in this matter.</hi> I told you it was hard to ſay, who does, <hi>optimum quod ſic.</hi> Well, but then I wiſhed you to put it to the teſt; and to try the debate of it by this rule of wiſdome and conſcience, <hi>tene quod cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est, relinque quod incertum,</hi> hold that which is certain, leave that which is uncertain; it is certain, that the Scripture is infalible, and you confeſſe it: it is not certain, that the Church is infalible, and I deny it. Which then, ſhould you take to be the rule and ground and cauſe of faith? So I in my laſt. But you leave out all notice of my diſputing this with you, in point of wiſdome, and cut off your own confeſſion; and would have me to make this a Demonſtration, abſolutely in point of truth. You do wiſely to ſhuffle it off, ſince you cannot well bear the dint of it in the way of diſcourſe, <hi>ad hominem.</hi> And yet alſo is it neceſſarily certain, that if our grounds be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, then your's are not, becauſe they are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie.</p>
            <p>But you making it to be in my account, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Demonſtration: anſwer, <hi>firſt, the Scripture connot be proved to be the word of God, without the Church be infalible, as I ſhall ſhew ch.</hi> 8. But this was not now the particular queſtion. I diſputed upon your own conceſſion. And therefore this is nothing to my Argument. Apply your anſwers to my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with you upon your account of prudence. And then, ſecondly. Though it be not a Demonſtration, that <hi>[the Scripture is infalible, the Church not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I must take for my ground the Scripture]</hi> yet, it concludes upon advantage: for, though the Church
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:40740:228"/> were infalible, in the teſtimony of the Scripture, to be the word of God, yet the Scripture were to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ground of all neceſſary points. Thirdly. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it contradict my aſſertions, that the Church is not the rule and cauſe of faith, though it were infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in this Teſtimony; for, if it were infalible in this, yet would it not follow, it ſhould be infalible in all; as I have told you, and you have not anſwered me yet. And then Fourthly. The Scripture may appeare to be the word of God, though the Church be not infalible, as will be ſhewed in anſwer to you.</p>
            <p>And therefore all you ſay upon this; <hi>hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſecondly, that the Church must have infalibilitie ſufficient to ſupport this most weightie Article of our faith, that all the Scripture is the word of God: and therefore, upon her Authority I believe the Scripture to be moſt infalible; yet, becauſe I ground this belief upon her Authoritie, her Authoritie is yet the last ground of faith.</hi> I ſay, all this hath no ſound diſcourſe, and will come <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, even into nothing, upon the two laſt anſwers: firſt becauſe, if from hence I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures to be the word of God; yet, am I not therefore, <hi>ex vi conſequentiae,</hi> bound to hold the Church the laſt ground of faith in all things; for, it plainly concludes, <hi>a dicto ſecundum quid.</hi> We can hold, that the Generall Councell may be infalible in points neceſſary, though not in all points what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, although you muſt hold infalibilitie in all or none; becauſe you ſay, all is delivered by the Church, upon her Authority equally, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the matter. And then ſecondly, upon the laſt anſwer, which was the fourth, we ſhall caſhiere all that is ſaid here; for, that it will appear, that the Scripture is the word of God without the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authoritie for the corroboration of the Title. And ſo there needs not the <hi>infalibilitie ſufficient to
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:40740:229"/> ſupport this moſt weighty Article of faith, that all the Scripture is the word of God.</hi>

               <hi>And whereas in your next number, you promiſe ſuch ſouls as have forſaken an infalible Church, an happy eternity, upon this ground, that thoſe things which are neceſſary to Salvation are plain in Scripture; I pray God, their Soules come not to be required at your hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. I am beholding to my Adverſary for his good wiſhes, that, I may not anſwer for other mens ſouls. But, if he takes here <hi>forſaken</hi> formally, and <hi>an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Church</hi> really ſo, (not accounted only to be ſo by him) I deny it, that we have ſo forſaken ſuch a Church, for neither is it infalible <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and beſides, they have rather forſaken us, and the whole Church, in pretending infalibilitie to themſelves, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation over all that will be true Chriſtians. No par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church can be bound to another, more than as it doth comply with the Catholick Church: now, then if any do leave the Catholick (as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath done) we cannot join with them, wherein they leave the Catholick, either in point of faith or diſcipline. If we are to give reſpect to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, as an actuall part of the whole, then, where it ſeparates, we muſt follow the whole. <hi>A tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis eſt omnis pars univerſo ſuo non congruens.</hi> And yet, they firſt made the actuall Schiſm, when the Popes Bull prohibited communion with us.</p>
            <p>So then, take <hi>forſaken</hi> rightly, and <hi>an infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church</hi> really, we deny the charge. Take them otherwiſe, we denie the conſequence of danger.</p>
            <p>But, my Adverſarie would prove our ground to be groundleſs, <hi>first, becauſe no Soul can have infalible aſſurance of the Scriptures being the true word of God, if the Church be not infalible, &amp;c.</hi> Whereof you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe more. <hi>Num.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <pb n="545" facs="tcp:40740:229"/>
            <p>Anſ. This we have had ſo often without proof, that it is to no purpoſe, to ſay any thing to words, for Arguments. <hi>Scaurus negat;</hi> as, <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro</hi> oppoſeth his adverſary. Yea, alſo you refer me here for proof in the third ch. Your concluſion is here: your proof there; ſo far is your concluſion from proof. Premiſſes were wont to be before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, but your opinion is already ſhewed vaine, as touching the ground of your certainty: and your vanity of my opinion I ſhall refute when you ſhew it.</p>
            <p>And ſo you ſerve me for the ſecond reſpect, wherein you ſay, my ground is groundleſſe; for, you ſay, <hi>it is manifeſtly falſe, that all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture, as you ſhew, ch.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Your concluſion here, that <hi>it is manifeſtly ſalſe,</hi> &amp;c. I believe will be too large for your Arguments, as it is now too ſoon. We follow your order, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to do, untill you begin.</p>
            <p>In your eighth Par. You ſay, <hi>I find nothing in the next Par. which I have not here anſwered. Onely, you ſtill force me to ſay again, I would have every one to know, that the Roman Church doth oblige to no more, than to believe that the Pope, defining with a lawfull Councell, cannot erre, what proceedeth from this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, we profeſſe to proceed from the Authority of the Church. When the Church diffuſed, admitteth theſe definitions, her conſent is yet more apparent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay, you find nothing in it, which here you have not anſwered. And what can I finde here, but, that you ſay, <hi>Only you force me to ſay again.</hi> Here is ſome ingenuitie, that you ſeem not to love to ſwell your papers with repetitions. Therefore prove it once: ſay it no more. <hi>Quid verba audiam, facta cum non videam?</hi> But if I might be ſo bold, doth not your term <hi>force</hi> referre to the act <hi>ſay,</hi> not to the Adverb
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:40740:230"/> 
               <hi>again,</hi> as if you had no mind to be put upon expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing where the infalibilitie of the Church lies deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately? I ſuppoſe by your words, if you were let alone, you would expreſſe your ſelves in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way confuſely, and in generall, that this infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie is in the Church; whether diffuſed as you ſay, or repreſentative, or virtuall. But it is very wiſely determined by my Antagoniſt, that it is in the Pope, when he defines with a General Councel, that if the Pope be convinced of errour, it may be anſwered, he did not define with a Councell; if a Councel be deprehended of error, it may be ſaid, the Pope did not confirm the decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. And yet the needle doth not ſtand full North; it trembles yet, therefore, <hi>in omnem eventum,</hi> it is ſaid; <hi>when the Church diffuſed admitteth thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, her conſent is more apparent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May ſome queſtions be aſked here, which may be in anſwer to this? when you ſay (immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>what proceeds from this authority we profeſs to proceed from the Authority of the Church:</hi> Does my Adverſary mean that it proceeds from all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church? The Pope, with a lawful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, hath Authority in the Church, and what comes from them, comes from the Authoritie of the Church <hi>objective;</hi> becauſe this Authority is for the uſe of the Church, and comes from the Authoritie of the Church <hi>ſubjective,</hi> becauſe it comes from them who have Authoritie in the Church. But is the Pope and Councell the adequate ſubject of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church? If not, then infalibilitie muſt not be reſted in them, without the conſent of the Diffuſed Church. Secondly, If you meane the Pope and Councell agreeing, as you do, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Church as long as they do diſagree, as the fifth Generall Councell and Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> did?
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:40740:230"/> Yea, that Councell obtained againſt the Pope; and is accounted by the Church Univerſall, in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Generall Councels without the Pope; ſo that your opinion of the infalibility of the Church, to conſiſt in a Pope defining with a Councel, is not ſound, becauſe, if it be infalible, it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible without the Pope; ſince it hath <hi>vim Conſilii</hi> without the Pope; yea, maugre the Pope. Thirdly, If Pope and Councel do conſent, what if the diffuſed Church will not admit theſe definitions? what then? And I think I have reaſon to ſuſpect, that ſuch words are here caſt out by my Adverſary, as may inſinuate as much as if the Church diffuſed might diſſent. If they may diſcent, then they may diſcent from that which is infalible, or elſe infalibilitie muſt alſo include their conſent. If they may not diſſent, then what meane thoſe words, <hi>when the Church diffuſed admitteth theſe definitions, her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is yet more apparent?</hi> Me thinks ſomewhat is intimated here to ſuch a purpoſe, as if the conſent of the Church diffuſed (beſides what is included in the Repreſentative) ſhould formally concurre to the making up of the complement of infalibilitie. So that the Church diffuſed, ſhould not conduce to theſe infalible Decrees, by way of object, or as a paſſive principle, but alſo actively, by its conſent, and this ſymbolizeth with <hi>Alphonſus de Castro,</hi> and others of your Church, who do ſettle this infalibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the Acceptation of the Church Univerſall. And by their opinion, the Church diffuſed muſt have a freedome to diſſent, or no power.</p>
            <p>Par. 9. You ſay, <hi>as for your complaint, that your paper is not fully anſwered, I ſuppoſe, that if any thing of importance was left unanſwered, you will tell me of it here, that I may here anſwer it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. Back reckonings are not wont to be very
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:40740:231"/> pleaſant. But now it ſeems too late to returne an account of my Adverſaries omiſſions, if he was my Adverſary who now is under the reverence of the dead, and the protection of the grave. Otherwiſe I might ſay, there needs not be any particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in an univerſall Negative. Materially, little is anſwered; and formaly, leſſe. But a Treatiſe was ſent me for an anſwer; yet in ſatisfaction to our own cauſe, and in reſpect to this demand, without diſ-ingenuitie, I ſhall, it may be, now and then note ſome defects. And if any ſhould think that the fight is over when one of the parties is dead; and that <hi>actio moritur cum perſona,</hi> I ſhall onely ſay this, that this is no perſonal quarrel, but reſpects the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of truth, and yet alſo is it fit that I ſhould returne an anſwer to a reply, as it would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And when this is done I have done.</p>
            <p>And now comes my Adverſarie to a vindication of the manner of anſwering me before. <hi>Concerning my manner of anſwering you, I must tell you, that St. Thomas, and the chief School Divines, for claritie and brevitie uſe to proceed thus.</hi> And then he gave me an account of their method, which is ſufficiently known.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do uſe a very good method in the way of their diſcourſe, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> but our caſe is not the ſame. For my adverſary was not now upon a <hi>problem,</hi> to diſpute upon either part; but upon an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which is defended againſt him. They had not one particular Adverſary againſt whom they were to direct all they ſaid; but my Antagoniſt had. My Antagoniſt ſent me a chalenge, which was faſtned upon me; I anſwered in ſhort: he replyed; I rejoined with an anſwer; and he returned a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>in termino.</hi> And therefore this will not ſerve.
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:40740:231"/> How doth he apply his poſitive Divinity to my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive? How is the Treatiſe applied to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions? Do his poſitives fall flat againſt my deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als? This way the Reader, to be ſure, ſhall know what he ſaies, but not what I ſaid, diſtinctly; becauſe the Treatiſe is not punctually applied to my anſwer. Had <hi>Bellarmin</hi> produced his Adverſaries Arguments no more fully than is done in that Treatiſe, there had not been ſuch need of being ſo carefull, that in all <hi>Italy</hi> (as Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> notes) we ſhould not finde a <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> Controverſies, for fear any ſhould peruſe them, and not finde his Adverſaries Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſatisfactorily anſwered by him.</p>
            <p>Therefore we may have leave to admire thoſe words which come from the Treater, that <hi>your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in rejoining by a Treatiſe was to have the most important matter, diſtinctly, orderly, and fully put down. And by having done ſo, I finde this great commoditie, that your Anſwer becomes more methodicall, and my reply to your Anſwer more clear and perſpicuous, and the Reader ſeeth ſtill how order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Combate is.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap>, as I followed the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent? Or could my Anſwer again be more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall than in following a Reply, had it been proper and formall and pat? could the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matter in debate betwixt us have been more diſtinctly, orderly and fully put down, than to have ſhewn from place to place, where I had not anſwered directly to the ſtate of the queſtion, or had hit the queſtion, but did not ſufficiently take off the Argument? And could his Reply be by this manner more clear and perſpicuous, when it cannot appeare plainly how he took off my Anſwers, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:40740:232"/> to the matter or form of my occaſionall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments? If this be an orderly Combate, then let us beat the aire, and that will be ſufficient to beat an Adverſary. Thus much of the firſt Chapter; which is no hard Chapter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Anſ. It ſeems he is pleaſed to forbeare any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my retortion of his ſimilitude, but he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my returning to him the greater probabilitie of prejudice in point of Religion, to be on their part. And he argues the contrary, becauſe, <hi>being Recuſants, upon this account are liable to loſe two parts of their Eſtates, and what elſe we are, or ſhall be pleaſed to take from them, be it goods, libertie or life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. The prejudice on their part, was as I ſaid, upon the opinion of the infalibilitie of their Church: ſo that I ſpake upon account of a religious <hi>intereſſe;</hi> and he anſwers me upon a civill account rather. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is not pertinent. And whereas he would ſeem to have good ground in Conſcience for his Religion, for which he ſuffers ſo much; if he intends to vye
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:40740:232"/> with us in that kind, others of our Religion have ſuffered more from them. Surely he forgets the <hi>Marian</hi> days, wherein we dropped more blood than they have done.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaies to me, — <hi>and what elſe you are or ſhall be pleaſed to take from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to this much might be ſaid alſo without paſſion in the ſame kind. No man can take away more from us than our lives, one would think. Yes, <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks would take away from us Heaven too. They had almoſt deſtroyed me upon earth, ſaith the Pſalmiſt: But theſe will deſtroy us in heaven alſo. Secondly. If he who was mine Adverſary was a Native of <hi>England,</hi> he was as much included in the order of his deprivation as I. Thirdly, I will ſay more yet, that ſome of his Religion have had more favour than we. Yea, yet more than this; one (whom I think he knows well) hath loſt more in proportionall quantity (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) than, any of them hath loſt, who hath loſt but two parts of three, and for Conſcience too. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that character which I gave the Romaniſt, he is to keep ſtill untill he can prove it doth belong more to us. Certainly this is not proved not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, becauſe they have ſuffered ſo much for their Religion; for we have ſuffered more and therefore it doth not belong to us, but them rather. But this ſuffering <hi>de ſe</hi> is eaſily known not to make an Argument: for unleſſe our cauſe be good before we ſuffer, we have no cauſe to ſuffer at all. The ſaying is common, <hi>Cauſa non paſſio facit Martyrem.</hi> Fourthly. As for the preſent ſufferings of the Papiſts, they are neither rightly charged either upon our Church, or upon our Kingdome; for there is not yet proved any legall conſent of either to what they or others have ſuffered. Nay, fifthly, At the day of
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:40740:233"/> Judgement we ſhall ſee whether they are not more like to anſwer for what we have ſuffered, than we for what they have ſuffered in theſe times.

            <p>And alſo that <hi>amongst</hi> thoſe <hi>meanes, the firſt is true faith,</hi> and that <hi>according to his mercifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he hath provided us ſome way to this faith ſo eaſie, that all, if they pleaſed, might be brought to the knowledge of it;</hi> namely, <hi>exceptis excipiendis.</hi> And that the <hi>greater part of men are ignorant;</hi> yea, all naturally ignorant of the way to this ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall end, as <hi>Aquinas,</hi> becauſe it is ſupernaturall; theſe things we yield to you. And that <hi>becauſe the far greater part were ignorant, it beſeemed his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (who is the lover of ſoules) to provide us ſuch a way as that ignorant men ſhould not be able (unleſſe by wilful careleſneſſe) to erre by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things we do willingly yield. But we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre upon your aſſumption, that this way ſhould be the Church, as you interpret that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 35, where you ſay, the Prophet ſpeakes of a <hi>path and a way which ſhall be ſo direct that fools cannot erre by it.</hi> Here we muſt ſtand a while and inquire what is the ſenſe of this way.</p>
            <p>And firſt I muſt note that you do not rightly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:40740:233"/> the words according to the Hebrew veritie. You ſay, <hi>and it ſhall be unto you a direct way, ſo that fools cannot erre.</hi> But it is not ſo in the text. But thus. [He ſhall be to them or with them walking the way, and fools ſhall not erre.] How is your Church like to be this way, when either you erre in not following it, or it doth erre in not right follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the text. And you make it to be in the text <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way,</hi> and ſo <hi>that fools cannot erre.</hi> Whereas it is rather [ſhall not erre,] which doth note ſo much infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie as preſervation from error. Now a negative of the act doth not prove a negative of the power; for then the Argument would be good, <hi>a non eſſe ad non poſſe.</hi> Therefore could my Adverſary have proved, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never erred, (which will never be proved) yet all is not yet whole; becauſe infalibilitie is not yet proved by the not erring, but by an impoſſibilitie of erring. And if you may erre <hi>by careleſneſſe,</hi> as before, then when were any ſure of being right; for who can be ſure he hath been as carefull as he ſhould be? and therefore if this be the condition of not being deceived, yea, of infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, it is at leaſt morally impoſſible, that any ſhould be aſſured in their faith; becauſe they may be wanting in their diligence; and ſo alſo may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit a deprivation of Divine light.</p>
            <p>My Adverſary goes on. <hi>To elude this text you ſay, ſure we may be, that the letter doth reſpect the Jewiſh Church after their redemption from Captivitie.</hi> Anſ. And I ſee no reaſon to the contrary, if we conſider ſeveral expreſſions in that place, which carry that ſcope; and alſo if we conſider, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at leaſt when any thing is prophecied myſtically of the Church Chriſtian in the old Inſtrument, it is yet true in the letter of the Jews. And alſo thirdly, If we will take notice of the Septuagint, who render it,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:40740:234"/> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thoſe that are diſperſed ſhall walke amongſt them and not erre. And if you take this verſion to be the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gints, you may know they knew the text as well as the Latine Church.</p>
            <p>Therefore this you would ſuppoſe and argue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. <hi>If he did direct the Jewiſh Church by a way ſo direct; that fools could not erre by it, there can be no good reaſon why he ſhould be leſſe carefull to direct the ignorant of the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. My Adverſary did not conſider, that if it be underſtood of the Jewiſh Nation, it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be underſtood of the Jewiſh Church under that formality. It may be intended of them in the civill ſenſe, and not in their Eccleſiaſticall reſpect: and then we cannot argue from a temporall promiſe made to the Jew, to a Spirituall promiſe made to the Chriſtian; though men are bold to make ſuch accommodations. For then might we, of our own power, make a myſtical ſenſe of Scripture, wherein one thing ſhould by Divine intention ſignifie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, this we cannot do; for then myſticall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie ſhould be Argumentative, which is denied even by the Pontificians.</p>
            <p>Yet he goes on. <hi>Yet I thinke it is ſure that this is not the true Interpretation. For when did the blinde ſee, the deaf hear, when did then God come himſelf and ſave us?</hi> Anſ. It may be underſtood in the letter, and yet ſome expreſſions be hyperbolical; Yea, thoſe expreſſions may be underſtood in the letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hyperbolicalneſſe; as that thoſe who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought to ſee or heare of ſuch a Redemption actual, ſhould ſee and heare of it, ſhould not onely heare of it, but ſee it. Secondly, When do we heare of vengance and recompence ſpoken of, ver 4. And drie ground and pools and habitation of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:40740:234"/> and a place for reeds and ruſhes, ſpoken of, ver. the 7. to be in the Church Chriſtian in a ſpirituall ſenſe? Put one to the other: and which of them hath more moment? And to the other queſtion, <hi>when did then God come himſelf and ſave us?</hi> We anſwer, this makes no Scruple of ſuch an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it to the Jew; neither becauſe it is ſaid <hi>he will come,</hi> nor becauſe it is ſaid <hi>he will ſave.</hi> Not the firſt nor the ſecond, for the firſt is as ordinarie, as the terme <hi>ſave</hi> is uſuall in the old Inſtrument for the temporall ſenſe. Wherefore had <hi>Joſhua</hi> his name from the ſame root? was he to be a ſpirituall Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? It is true he was typicall of Chriſt Jeſus, but he was typicall by a temporal deliverance, yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Greek word is ſometimes uſed for a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſalvation, in the new <hi>Teſtament,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.25. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Maſter ſave us, we periſh, yea, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which commonly is rendered Saviour, when applied to Chriſt, is ſometimes applied to God in the new <hi>Testament</hi> in a temporall ſenſe, as is noted rationally by ſome Criticks; and particulary in that text ſome give an inſtance thereof. 1 Ep. to <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. Who is the Saviour of all, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe that believe. He is the Saviour of all in a temporall ſenſe, ſpecially of thoſe who believe. And thus <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon the text would carrie it, for which expoſition he names <hi>Chryſostom, Oecumenius, Ambroſianus, Anſelme.</hi> And he ſaid poſitively, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat autem ex aliis Scripturae locis, &amp;c.</hi> it is manifeſt alſo out of other places of Scripture, that the term of ſalvation is underſtood of the good things of the temporall life. So he upon the place.</p>
            <p>He proceeds. <hi>And if you will have our Saviour himſelf to be this way, as he ſaid, I am the truth and the way; this ſelf ſame Saviour ſaid, I (who am this way) am with you to the conſummation of the world;
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:40740:235"/> to wit, directing my Church the right way to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: of which direction the Church now hath no leſſe need than then.</hi> Anſ. He ſuppoſeth that which is not granted, nor yet doth he go about to prove it, that it is to be underſtood by Divine intention of the Chriſtian Church <hi>objective,</hi> This is not to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſſe myſticall Divinity were in the nature of it argumentative. And my ſecond anſwer to this text, wherein I referred it to the time of Chriſt in way of ſuppoſition, (if it were at all to be referred to the time of the Chriſtian Church according to <hi>Iſider, Clarius</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom.</hi>) he cannot well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but will argue from it, that the <hi>Church hath no leſſe need of direction now than then.</hi> Anſ. This Reply hath no ſtrength of reaſon in it, for the foundation of Chriſtianitie was then to be layd; which foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation perſonall was Chriſt, then it was to be built upon the foundation miniſteriall, the Apoſtles alſo, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. The new Teſtament was not then written, the propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was not then made, Chriſtian Doctrine was not univerſally received. And therefore then was there more need of infalible direction by Chriſt and his Apoſtles than now. And this really anſwereth your ſuppoſition, that ſuch an infalible direction which by our Saviour was promiſed to the Church by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhould alwaies continue in the Church; whereas it is not ſo neceſſary by neceſſitie of meane or end. And therefore, can we not make a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it <hi>a cauſa finali,</hi> becauſe it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the end of Salvation. <hi>Deus nec deficit in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariis, nec abundat in ſuperfluis,</hi> as he ſaid: he is neither wanting in neceſſaries, nor is abundant in ſuperfluities.</p>
            <p>But this paſſage muſt be made good by them, or all is loſt; therefore he goes on. <hi>And as we could
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:40740:235"/> not ſecurely have put a limitation to thoſe words of Joel</hi> (namely, concerning the powring out of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) <hi>if St. Peter had not ſecured us of the true ſenſe: ſo cannot you limit theſe words, not having the like warrant for it.</hi> Anſ. So then firſt, Are thoſe words of <hi>Joel</hi> limited? Yes, he confeſſeth it, and it is ſo plain by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that it cannot be denied. Upon this confeſſion we diſpute. If thoſe words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> be limited, then alſo the other text [<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. laſt. I am with you to the end of the world] is alſo limited. The conſequence is, it may be, demanded. It is given thus. If the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt are not now to be expected as then, then can we not now pretend infalibilitie as then, becauſe this is a ſpeciall gift of the Holy Ghoſt. Therefore have we no ſuch need of an infalible limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that text by ſome other paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for <hi>interpretative,</hi> as we may ſpeak, it is here done by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in a text of the ſame kind; ſo that although it doth not follow, that becauſe one text is limited by Scripture, therefore we may limit ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther text; yet if the text in queſtion be of the ſame kind, we do not limit it, but ſhew, that it is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently limited. For ſecondly, All other extroardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſpenſations of the Holy Ghoſt are terminated in the event: no more Apoſtles, no more Prophets, no more Evangeliſts, no more gift of tongues; and why then ſhould the gift of infalibilitie be held up? And why had not thoſe (whom ſome of yours have ſpoke of) who were ſent to preach the Goſpell to the Heathens, the gift of tongues miraculouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, which might have been an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and credit to their infalible Doctrine?</p>
            <p>Yet he would continue power of miracles too: to this purpoſe he urgeth the text, <hi>thoſe that believe ſhall do greater works than theſe. John.</hi> 14.12.</p>
            <pb n="558" facs="tcp:40740:236"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſubject of that propoſition <hi>[thoſe that believe]</hi> is conſiderable in the ſuppoſition, and in the oppoſition. In the ſuppoſition it is to be conſidered, how many it extends to; in the oppoſition, to what ſort of men, whether Clergy or Laitie: conſider it in the ſuppoſition, and we ſay, If it be extended to the preſent Church, we denie it: If it be not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it concludes nothing. Conſider it in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as to what ſort of men it belongs; then, if you take it incluſively to the Laitie, then by your Argument, infalibility ſhould be in them. For ſo your diſcourſe muſt run, thoſe that do greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles than Chriſt, they may be infalible: then I aſſume, If you take it incluſively of the Laitie, the Laitie may do greater works than Chriſt, then they are infalible. And then how, or why do you ſtate infalibilitie in the Pope and a Councel, which are two things that do not eaſily come together? And ſo the ſubject of the propoſition muſt be taken, for it bears no reſpect to holy Orders, <hi>ſecundum ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſpecialem;</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>thoſe that believe,</hi> not thoſe of the Clergie which believe. So it hath it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all ſorts of men that do believe: and if my Adverſary tooke it as of the Clergie, let me pay him in his own coin, in telling him, we may not limit it without <hi>a warrant;</hi> ſince, if all their Clergie did work miracles; yet all that do work miracles are not Clergie men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Text is not ingenuouſly applied; for, it ſhould not be applied to miracles, as he doth; but to workes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there refers to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now all works are not miracles, though all miracles are ſaid to be works. All Chriſt's works were not miracles: and Chriſt did not alwaies at all times work miracles. And therefore doth your <hi>Ferus</hi> upon the place note, that it is not ſaid, <hi>ſemper &amp; omni loco ſigna faciet,</hi>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:40740:236"/> he ſhall alwaies and in all places do ſignes, nay, upon the ſame place, whereas ſome underſtand it of ſigns, he ſaies, this were hard, that no man ſhould be a Believer, but he ſhould do ſigns, <hi>quandoquidem nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus noſtrum hoc tempore ſignum facit.</hi> Therefore he ſaith, ſome underſtand it not of workes of miracles, but of works of virtues.</p>
            <p>And therefore the following words needed not to have beene added, <hi>If then this text was verified after our Saviours time, you cannot ſay it is onely ſpoken of his time, and that he did take away a way ſo neceſſary for us, his gifts being without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is nothing to the purpoſe, though we grant, it did continue ſometime after Chriſt, unleſs it be drawn down to the times of the preſent Church it is inconſequent to your uſe: Yea, thoſe words of Chriſt <hi>[I am with you unto the end of the world,]</hi> may be verified without any infalibilitie in the Church reſident in men; much more without infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie in a particular Church: It is a plaine falacie of conſequent, his being with them infalibly is a way of being with them; therefore every way of being with them is a way of infalibilitie. And this is ſufficient to deſtroy the hopes which the <hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> have of this Text. Beſides that, if infalibilitie were by this Text continually promiſed to the Church univerſal, the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> cannot come in for any more than a part; for this is ſaid by Chriſt, and at his aſcenſion too to all the Apoſtles <hi>in communi;</hi> and therefore from this Text they can chalenge no priviledge of ſucceſſion to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> or Vicariate to Chriſt, becauſe this is ſpoken to them all, which is alſo expreſſed in the Syriack. So that your diſcourſe hereupon goes upon a double errour in the Rule thereof: firſt, becauſe you argue <hi>a genere ad ſpeciem
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:40740:237"/> affirmative,</hi> for thus you muſt reaſon, he will be with them to the end of the world, therefore as he was with the Apoſtles, infalibly. Secondly, Becauſe you argue <hi>a toto ut ſic ad partem;</hi> becauſe he will be with the Church univerſall, therefore with you who are but a part. And alſo, what if the Apoſtles did greater miracles than Chriſt? what is this to your purpoſe? Or if other believers ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards do greater miracles, your Repreſentative Church would be leſſe neceſſary, for they that could work miracles would not need your infalible direction. Or if they did, then cannot you conclude from ſuppoſed continuance of miracles, continuance of infalibility.</p>
            <p>Put then your reaſon into a forme and it will be an <hi>Enthymem, his gifts are without repentance,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>he hath not taken away a way ſo neceſſary:</hi> and what then? There might have been taken away a way ſo neceſſary to ſhew Sophiſtry. To the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent therefore we ſay, there is an equivocation in the word <hi>gifts.</hi> The word ſometimes ſignifies grace of gifts, ſometimes gifts of grace. If you take it here of the former, it were more pertinent to your ſcope; but ſo it is not true to the text. If of the latter, it is true to the meaning of the place; but 'tis not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to your purpoſe: and becauſe he knew the text [<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.] not to be underſtood of the grace of gifts; wiſely is there left out that which might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch appearance, namely, <hi>the calling,</hi> for ſo it runs, the gifts and calling of God are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>And that which follows in his reply is alſo capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For he did not finde in my words, that I appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the text to the Jews in the ſpirituall kind, as of infalibility, and therefore he ought not to thinke it ſtrange, that this <hi>gift ſhould not in full dimenſions
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:40740:237"/> be always extended to the Church:</hi> unleſſe we might from the litterall ſenſe to the Jew conclude a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, to the Chriſtian proportionably to the letter; which cannot rationally be done.</p>
            <p>He goes on. <hi>I cannot believe you trust your other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, if this way be promiſed to the Church,</hi> ergo, <hi>the Church is not this way. Suppoſe God had promiſed the Kingdome of France a Monarchy:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Kingdome of France (ſay you) is no Monarchy. The true conſequence is, the Kingdome of France is this Monarchy. Anſ.</hi> I am not diſpleaſed with mine own Argument, if there can be no more ſaid againſt it than is here. I know no difference betwixt a King and a Monarch ſufficient to ground a diſtinction, and in the new <hi>Testament</hi> the greek word which ſignifies a King is uſually applied to the expreſſing of Emperors. And therefore if God had promiſed the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> a Monarchy, he ſhould have promiſed it it ſelf. And ſo if God had promiſed the Church to be this way, he ſhould have promiſed it it ſelf. I had thought, that as the object of the thing in humane ſpeculation is before the act ſpeculative; ſo the object of perſon had been conſidered before acts practick, otherwiſe the object of the perſon and the object of the thing do not differ. Thus, if the promiſe of this way to the Church, be the promiſe of the Church its being this way, then the <hi>terminus rei</hi> and the <hi>terminus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae</hi> is all one. Therefore muſt this way be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Church: otherwiſe the Church hath nothing promiſed. And how can this way be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of the Church in ſuch a propoſition [the Church is this way] when according to your principles, the Church muſt have its exiſtence by this way, before it can be this way. And ſo muſt have its being before its cauſe, which amounts to a contradiction, that it ſhould be and not be; for it muſt be before it is. Yea; if the Church is to be ſuppoſed before it be the
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:40740:238"/> way, and yet is to have its conſiſtence by this way, this is to make that which is to be, which alſo makes that which is not to be, becauſe it muſt not be before it be.</p>
            <p>Yet he goes on. <hi>The Church is this way which God promiſed it ſhould be.</hi> But to whom did he promiſe it? To ſingulars before they are aggregated in the unity of a Church? Then the ſingulars yet muſt be a Church before they be a Church, becauſe this way was promiſed, you ſay, to the Church. If the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Church be the object of the promiſe to whom it is made; then again, how were the Chriſtians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith? Or how had they faith without a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, which is the way promiſed, as he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth?</p>
            <p>Yet again, <hi>and it is ſo by the ſure guidance of him who is the way, and is with his Church ruling it until the conſummation of the world. And ſo Chriſt is</hi> regula re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulans, <hi>and the Church</hi> regula regulata.</p>
            <p>So th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n at length my Adverſary is come to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; onely, he will not apply it as I did. I ſaid the Scripture is <hi>regula regulans,</hi> the Church is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula regulata:</hi> he ſaies now, that Chriſt is <hi>regula re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulans,</hi> the Church is <hi>regula regulata.</hi> So that in part he is come over to us, in that he ſays, the Church is the rule ruled: and he or any other could hardly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome us in the other, that Chriſt ſhould be the rule ruling, and not by the Scripture. Chriſt doth not now rule us immediately, but by the Spirit; and therefore is he ſaid to be the Spirit of Chriſt. neither doth the Spirit rule us immediately, but by the word which the Spirit of Chriſt did inſpire the Pen-men of Scripture in to this purpoſe. So it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that the Scripture is the word of Chriſt by his Spirit. And by this word which was firſt delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Spirit is Chriſt the way. He is the way of
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:40740:238"/> merit by his death. He is the way of example by his life. He is the way of precept and direction by his word. If he divides the word from the Spirit he makes it not the word of God: if he divides the Spirit from the word, ſo that the Spirit ſhould direct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the word, he runs into Enthuſiaſmes. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath it ſelfe to the word as the Dictator; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles have themſelves and the Prophets to the word as the Pen-men. The word hath it ſelf to us as the rule, which from God through Chriſt by his Spirit in the Pen-men of Scripture is to direct us unto our Supernaturall end. Therefore ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſedome, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16. To conclude then this Anſwer, ſince Chriſt is now confeſſed to be the rule ruling, he is the rule ruling, either by his Church or by his word. If by his Church, as my Adverſary, how is this Church to be ruled, ſince this is the rule ruled? By his Spirit they will ſay; well, but how? In a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, they will ſay, confirmed by the Pope. But for the firſt three hundred yeares their was no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill; nor Pope in their ſence, for more. How then? Then by his Spirit, cauſally, in the word; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Collen</hi> reſolved to reform his Church: for which he was cited before the Emperour: and excomunicated afterwards by the Pope, in the yeare 1546.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>being ruled by him there is not the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that it will ſwerve from the word of God, and you may well follow ſuch a Guide with blinde obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So my Antagoniſt goes on upon the Church. <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this paſſage much may be ſaid. Firſt, that the former words are wiſely put together: <hi>ſi non caste, tamen caute.</hi> For there is a reſerve of ſenſe in which they are true; namely, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> whilſt it is ruled by Chriſt, there is not the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:40740:239"/> of ſwerving from the word of God, but it is yet to be proved, that it will always be ruled by Chriſt. Make this ſure and we have done. But if it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ruled by Chriſt, it would not have viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his inſtitution of Communion under both kinds. Put this then into a forme of diſcourſe: that which is ruled by Chriſt doth not ſwerve from his word; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ruled by Chriſt therefore: and we limit the major, ſo far as it is ruled by Chriſt it doth not ſwerve from the word; it is not true, that it never ſwerves, unleſſe it be true, that it is always ruled by Chriſt; but then we deny the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, for it is not always ruled by Chriſt. 2. We note here, that the rule Chriſt rules us by, is his word, for ſo it is ſaid here, <hi>being ruled by Chriſt it will not ſwerve from his word.</hi> So then by his own words, Chriſt's adequate rule is his word; otherwiſe we might be ruled by him and yet ſwerve from his word. And alſo conſequently if we follow his word, we follow him. And thoſe that do not follow his word do not follow him. Thirdly, we muſt differ with him upon the point of <hi>blinde obedience,</hi> therefore whereas he ſaies <hi>you may well follow ſuch a Guide with blind obedience,</hi> we ſay abſolutely, blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not rationall, it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in any ſenſe, and then we ſay again, this obedience he ſpeaks of, would be rational obedience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not blind. For, to follow ſuch a Guide which is always ruled by Chriſt, and therefore never ſwerves from his word (if this can be made good to me, that any Church doth, and cannot do other) is very rationall and not blind obedience. If the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and definition of the Church be aſſured by Chriſt and his word, to be according to Chriſt and his word, it is neceſſary to be obedient to it, as to what I finde in Scripure; though I do not comprehend the reaſon of it, as the Scripture doth bind to faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:40740:239"/> diſpute: ſo would the Church, were I aſſured by the Scripture, that the Church could not ſwerve from it. But here are two things wanting; one is of a proof, that the Church hath not ſwerved. And a ſecond, that it cannot ſwerve from the word of God. For my faith muſt build it ſelf immediately not upon the former; becauſe the power of ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is not ſufficiently ſecured by the negative; but it muſt be built upon the impoſſibilitie, and this ſhould be demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſtill I muſt mind you, that I ſpeake of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Church convented in a Generall Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Supreme Paſtor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And I ſtill ſay, that the Univerſall Church ſo conſtituted, is not free from the leaſt danger of ſwerving from the word of God. And this in groſſe were enough, untill it were made good by ſound Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Yet alſo particularly. Firſt, he meanes the Univerſall Church repreſentatively; (for otherwiſe, all cannot come together) but then let us have an account why there could not be admitted to the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, that which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rench ſo much urged, namely [repreſenting the Univerſall Church?] If it did repreſent the Univerſal Church, why might it not be ſaid in the title? If it did not, how does he ſay <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Church convented in a General Council?</hi> 2. A Supreme Paſtor in your ſenſe ſhould be proved and not ſuppoſed. For we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no Supreme Paſtor but Chriſt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> can give life or law to all the Church. He the Paſtor and Biſhop of our ſouls. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. He the chief Paſtor. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. And all Biſhops under him do equally participate a Vicarial care of the Church. But thirdly, the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, according to you, was general and confirmed by the Supreme Paſtor; and <hi>Vigilius</hi> was the Tutilarie Saint of the valley of Trent; and yet the Trent Councell
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:40740:240"/> ſwerved groſſely from the word of God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the matter of half communion; as in the twentie firſt ſeſſion, notwithſtanding Chriſt his inſtitution and the ſeverall interpretations of the Doctors and Fathers acknowledged againſt them in the firſt chap. of that ſeſſion; and although from the begining of Chriſtian Religion the uſe under both kinds was not unfrequent, as is confeſſed in the ſecond ch. Fourthly, if the Church ſo conſtituted cannot ſwerve from the word of God, why did the Trent Councell feare to determine what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of original ſin, which <hi>Viga</hi> urged them to, upon good reaſons? And why did they not determine whether the bleſſed Virgin was exempted from ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal infection, whereof the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> ſo much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the affirmative to be defined; the <hi>Dominicans</hi> the negative? And yet in ſaying, <hi>non eſſe ſuae inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> it was not of their intention to comprehend in this Decree, wherein original ſin is handled, the bleſſed and immaculate Virgine, they do interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively exempt her, though St. <hi>Paul</hi> and all holy Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> did not exempt her, as the <hi>Dominicans</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and ſo they do in effect contradict their univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal propoſition, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>Propagatione non imitatione transfuſum omnibus:</hi> at leaſt it makes that definition uncertain, as the German Proteſtants noted.</p>
            <p>Therefore that which followes in his Paper doth not follow in reaſon: <hi>This Church, guiding by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible Doctrine, is this way, the Church diffuſive (gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded now by this doctrine) was promiſed this direct way. Such a way we were promiſed, a way ſo direct repreſented, that fools cannot erre by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe words might have been all ſpared, for they are all as Ciphers till one thing be proved, and that is, the infalible Doctrine as a property inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:40740:240"/> to the Church. If the Church goes this way to prove her ſelfe the way, ſhe is not the way, becauſe ſhe goes out of the way, or elſe Chriſt was out of the way, and the Primitive Church was not the Church, when for ſo many yeares it is confeſſed, that there was no General Council: and is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there was a Pope in their ſence, as indeed there was none. So then the Church univerſal is not the way univerſally, <hi>ſo direct that fools cannot erre:</hi> for, in all times there was not the univerſall Church ſo repreſented; nor the Decrees of the repreſented Church ſo confirmed, becauſe there was no Pope. And therefore if yet the Church had another way then; we have more reaſon to go that way than the way which leads to <hi>Rome;</hi> and from <hi>Rome</hi> we know not whither but to darkneſſe: and thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this way are not wiſer by following it; for, they are not wiſe in following it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Hierocles</hi> ſaid well. Both theſe things are good, to know that we do not know, and to know what we do not know. And ſurely, if we ſhould go their blinde way, we ſhould neither know what wiſe men know, nor know neither that we are ignorant. Therefore <hi>Catarinus</hi> and <hi>Marinarus</hi> took another way to aſſert certainty of Grace, namely, by Scripture; as we have it in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, wherein they ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Adverſaries of the opinion, and brought them to ſome moderation.</p>
            <p>And this example of theirs in following the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might (if we were doubtfull of our cauſe) yet incourage us to give check to that which follows. <hi>The Scripture, as ſome may conceive, (for you dare not defend it) is not this way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> All conceive that it is the way but your Church. Yea, all your Church are not for this
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:40740:241"/> Church way. Beſides thoſe named the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Collen, Catarinus, Marinarus,</hi> how many even in the face of the Trent Councell have urged Scripture againſt all other Arguments. The antient Fathers made the Scripture their way and rule, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their authorities are not anſwered to by my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt; for that they are unanſwerable. Therefore we <hi>dare,</hi> and do <hi>defend it;</hi> for it will defend us in the doing of it. But this Campian bragged of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. We return as he did who was to be put to death, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates it, when the Executioner bad him beare it bravely; he replied, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam tu tam fortiter feries.</hi> So I would my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary had as ſtrongly oppoſed, as we are in hope to anſwer. But it were better for them to have either leſſe confidence, or to add more ſtrength. As <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> ſaid to his ſon after an unſucceſſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So let them give ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or quit the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee his reaſon. <hi>For we ſee with our eyes, not onely fools, but alſo moſt learned men to erre groſſely, and to follow moſt contradictorie opinions, whilſt they profeſſe from their hearts to follow Scripture as near as they can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Firſt, becauſe men do erre, therefore is not that the way? The errour is by them, becauſe they go from the way: not by the way, becauſe they go in it. It concludes as much, as if the way to <hi>Rome</hi> were not the way, becauſe, ſome men do not finde it. Secondly, they <hi>profeſſe from their hearts,</hi> as they ſay, to <hi>follow Scripture as near <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s they can:</hi> but do they from their hearts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it? Thirdly, if <hi>most learned men do erre groſſely and follow moſt contradictorie opinions, &amp;c.</hi> it ſeems then ſome moſt learned men think this is the way. Fourthly, if they follow moſt contradictorie opinions
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:40740:241"/> and yet follow Scripture, the fault muſt be in them; for you dare not ſay there is any contradiction in Scripture. Fifthly, they may be in way of Salvation, though ſome do erre in the ſenſe of Scripture, as it is drawn down in application to ſome points of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Sixthly, there ſhould have been conſidered here a poſſibilitie of recrimination with more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt the Adverſary. For how many of them do erre in following the Church, and are more prone to erre, becauſe the Church is more variable, and their traditions (which, they ſay, are part of the rule) are not written? In particular, how many of them paſſionately differ from one another about the ſubject of Eccleſiaſtick power, about temporall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether the Pope hath any? then whether direct or indirect? How many of them hotly maintained contrary opinions in the Council of Trent? And yet I hope they followed the Church. For if they held Scripture the rule, they were Adverſaries to my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. Seventhly. Therefore ſince men may finde your way, and yet erre by it; and not finde Scripture and yet erre by it (for the Church may, for ought is proved, teach errour, the Scripture not) let <hi>fools</hi> go that way, and <hi>moſt learned men</hi> goe the way of Scripture. My Argument then is yet good. That way which the Church goes we muſt go. And this they will not deny. But the Church goes the way of Scripture, and this they cannot deny. Nor is there any direct Anſwer made thereunto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>Neither is my fourth Anſwer anſwered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may we conclude contradictorily to his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this number, <hi>the viſible Church</hi> is not this <hi>Judge, by ſubmiſſion to the judgement</hi> whereof <hi>we are ſecured</hi> from all errour.</p>

               <note place="margin">Num. 3. S. 2.</note>
               <hi>Whence what you ſay againſt my third Number is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwered. For all Religions agreeing, that there must be one Judge of all controverſies, which either be or may be in Religion, they muſt all give infallibilitie to their Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And from what was ſaid before, all that you reply to my anſwer is eaſily anſwered, for no Religion but yours doth ſay, that there muſt be a formall, viſible Judge of all controverſies, infallible. And as for us, we ſay, there is no need of ſuch a Judge: and our principles do conclude negatively to ſuch a Judge. For whereas we ſay, <hi>God's written word hath plainly ſet down all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> as you do relate it, we alſo by conſequence inferre, that there is no need of controverſie in things neceſſary, becauſe, the Scripture hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined thoſe points which are neceſſary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which how true it is we ſhall ſhew in anſwer to <hi>your third Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All other Sectaries agreeing with you in that point, I underſtand not how you could ſay, that none but we hold an infallible Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If you include us here amongſt the Sectaries, as you ſeem to do, we deny the charge. And we ſay, we are no more Sectaries than the Catholick was before Papacie had head or foot in the world. We ſay, as he, my name is Chriſtian; my ſir-name is Catholick. We have made no ſuch change of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as to be accounted Hereticks, as you call us; nor of Diſcipline, as to be accounted Schiſmaticks: but we ſhould not appear ſo innocent, unleſſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſhould firſt accuſe us. And ſecondly, there are no Sectaries but you that do maintain the contrary: unleſſe they be Anabaptiſts and Enthuſiaſts, which make themſelves infallible Judges, as your ſingle Church makes it ſelf an infallible Judge. For, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:40740:242"/> thoſe who hold the Scripture to ſet down plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things neceſſary, are not in this Sectaries, as ſeems to be intimated in the former words. Nor, fourthly, by holding the Scripture to have plainly ſet down things neceſſary, do they inferre, that there is a neceſſity of an infallible Judge to decide all controverſies which may ſpring up; For their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on includes the contrary. And therefore upon the whole matter, the former words are not ſo rationally delivered.</p>
            <p>And what he ſaies afterwards, that <hi>without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide every man might proceed, as if your faith were fallible, and ſo give an infallible aſſent to nothing,</hi> is indeed <hi>gratis dictum.</hi> For if this diſcourſe be reſolved, as it muſt be, into this propoſition, With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an infallible Guide, our faith is fallible, and we can give infallible aſſent to nothing, it will appear to be ſalſe, becauſe the propoſition is falſe, as it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken univerſally. For though in points of queſtion I cannot give an aſſent infallibly to a Judge, unleſſe I do give an aſſent infallible to this Judge's being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; yet we hope, we may give an infallible aſſent to thoſe things which are plain in Scripture, and not queſtioned. Yea, ſecondly, I may give an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſent to that which is in queſtion, without an infallible Judge external; becauſe, by his agitation of it, I may ſee it plainly reſolved into the ſenſe of Scripture: which indeed is the formall rationall end of all Councils, that by the conference of learned men the meaning of Scripture as to the caſe may be cleared. The former diſcourſe therefore is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallacious, <hi>a dicto ſecundum quid,</hi> or <hi>a particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri;</hi> as if becauſe we cannot have an infallible faith of things diſputed without an infallible Judge, we could have no faith in any thing but fallible. Yea, it is falſe in thoſe particulars debated; for we may
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:40740:243"/> have a faith infallible of them by Scripture, though the Judge miniſteriall be not infallible. The faith <hi>objective</hi> is infallible in the Scripture, and the faith may he infallible <hi>ſubjective,</hi> by the rule of Scripture, and yet the Judge fallible, becauſe we may make uſe of the Fathers of the Church as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, not as Dictators.</p>
            <p>In the next words he would vindicate himſelf from ſaying, that <hi>without ſuch a Judge we ſhould be free to follow (without any fault) our private Judgement, in holding what we will, as you inſinuate. But I ſaid otherwiſe, every man might be free to believe what he judged best; and ſo we ſhould have as many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as there be private, and different judgements, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He doth me wrong in ſaying, that I <hi>put</hi> in <hi>ſuch words</hi> as I <hi>knew how to anſwer,</hi> and leaved out his <hi>true words:</hi> I altered no words, but expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in them, as I had reaſon. For if every one might be left free (without ſuch a Judge) to what he judged beſt, this freedome would be ſimple or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. If ſimple, then it would be without a fault: and if morall, it would be without a fault; but now he denies that he meant a morall freedome. Yet is it beſt for him to underſtand ſuch a freedome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his principles: for if we have not a morall freedome (without a fault) to believe what we judge beſt, then have we leſſe reaſon of giving undiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſſent to an externall Judge, ſince we are awed and commanded, under peril of a fault, to take heed what we do believe. And therefore cannot we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Judge with blind obedience, becauſe it ſeems now, we may not believe what we will, but we muſt ſee good reaſon for what we do believe: And good reaſon it is, that good reaſon ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude blind obedience. And indeed his conſequence
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:40740:243"/> is falſe <hi>in terminis,</hi> for we have not a ſimple free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to believe what we will, as I ſaid; becauſe the underſtanding naturally aſſents to truth apparent. But this he takes no notice of, as if I had ſaid no ſuch thing. How much of my words he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way privatively, which muſt inferre a variation of my ſenſe, may be gathered by compare of my copy with his reherſall: and it appears, that negatively he hath taken away a great part of my words; for he ſaies to them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And ſo his argument is null: and his vindication nullified. Onely I muſt alſo note, that he did not well weigh his own conſequence [if every man were left free to hold what he judged beſt, <hi>we ſhould have as many Religions as private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>] for in principles of Religion we are not like to differ, if we believe the Scripture: and particular Controverſies (which you direct your diſcourſe to, if you ſpeak <hi>ad idem;</hi> if not, you are more to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) do not make different Religions; becauſe then you muſt have different Religions amongſt your ſelves.</p>
            <p>In the begining of this number my Adverſary would faine take me tripping or enterfearing upon my own words by a conſequence:<note place="margin">Num. 4.</note> becauſe (as he thinks) I take away all meanes of regulating our judgement, and yet ſay, <hi>we ſhould not follow our own judgement of diſcretion, without meanes of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> His reaſon may well be put into this forme; he that taketh away all infallible means, takes away all means able to produce an infallible aſſent: but I <hi>take away all infallible means.</hi> Then I deny his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. I do not deny all infallible meanes. I do not deny all meanes, becauſe I deny ſome to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and I do not deny all infallible means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I deny ſome that he thinks infallible; in both he
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:40740:244"/> would impoſe upon me the fallacie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulari.</hi> All means are not infallible; and there may be, and is other infallible meanes beſides thoſe which he ſuppoſeth and I deny. The Scripture is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mean, to hold to this, I deny the infallibilitie of Councils. And then again ſecondly, I deny a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of infallible aſſent to all points of queſtion: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the contradiction may conſiſt with ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For corroboration of his opinion about the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Councils, he brings in afterward St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great's ſaying. <hi>I do profeſſe my ſelf to reverence the firſt four Councils as I reverence the four books of the Goſpell. And in like manner I do receive the fifth Council; whoſoever is of another mind, let him be an Anathema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, we do not think the judgement of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to be greater than the judgement of the four Councils: if we do not think them infallible, we have no cauſe or reaſon to be urged with one <hi>Gregory.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we alſo reverence the learning of that <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as he reverenceth the books of the Goſpell, if the <hi>as</hi> be taken in ſimilitude, not proportion; in the quality not equality. Thirdly, if the opinion of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhould prevaile with me, why doth not the Authority of the Fathers whom I produced for our cauſe, and the anſwers I gave to his Authorities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, prevaile with him. <hi>Teſtem quem quis inducit pro ſe tenetur recipere contra ſe.</hi> Fourthly, let us marke his own words. <hi>And I alſo receive the fifth Councill in like manner.</hi> Now the fifth Council was that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wherein <hi>Vigilius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in his defence of the three Chapters: And the Council proceeded without his conſent, yea, and againſt his mind. So that if St. <hi>Gregory's</hi> authoritie were authentick the cauſe were ſpoiled; for ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:40740:244"/> ſhould not be ſtated in a Council with the Popes confirmation. Fifthly, oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front <hi>Gregory</hi> with <hi>Gregory, Nazianzen</hi> with the <hi>Roman;</hi> and which of them ſhall we believe for Councils? Neither doth the <hi>whole machin of our Religion tople and tumble to the ground</hi> upon my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer principle, as he imagined, though he would preſſe me more ſtrongly to <hi>ſhew upon what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I take Scripture by an infallible aſſent to be the word of God?</hi> This by the way ſhould not have been brought into queſtion with us, ſince we give more reverence to the Scriptures than they do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are like to have a firmer faith in it to be the word of God than they. The main deſign of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary at firſt, I ſuppoſe, was, to debate the faith of particular points, the Scripture being ſuppoſed to be the word of God; although not ſuppoſed by him to be the onely rule. But therefore let me returne his own words changing the tables, that the <hi>whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin of</hi> his <hi>Religion doth tople and tumble to the ground</hi> upon his ground, by preſſing him to ſhew <hi>by what authority he takes Scripture by an infallible aſſent to be the word of God,</hi> before he hath proved the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Church.</p>
            <p>His reaſon follows, <hi>becauſe there cannot be a more groundleſs ground upon which you, by rejecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority of the Church, are forced to build your whole religion; to wit, that you by meer reading of Scripture can by its light (as you diſcover the ſun by its light) diſcover it ſo manifeſtly to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God, that this diſcovery ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to ground your infallible aſſent to that verity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt he is not ſurely right in this, that I am forced, by rejecting his way of believing Scripture, to this way. If he be, then I am right in the choice of my
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:40740:245"/> principle upon my refuſal of his: but Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (whom he blames me for differing from in this point) does find (as it may ſeem, and as he himſelf profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) a middle way of grounding faith in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the word of God, namely, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of univerſall Tradition: which as any can diſtinguiſh from this way, ſo he doth diſtinguiſh from the <hi>Pontifician</hi> way, as is known: but this we ſhall have fuller occaſion to ſpeake of hereafter. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas he ſaies, that I ſay <hi>by meer reading of Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> he ſuppoſeth that which is not ſo. For I do not deny the uſe of other meanes to further us towards our aſſent, intrinſecall arguments from Scripture, extrinſecall of the Church: but that which privately we reſolve our faith of Scripture to be the word of God in, is the autopiſtie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which God by faith infuſed ſhews unto us. And by <hi>Catarinus</hi> his reaſoning in the Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil about ſubjective certitude of grace, private faith is not inferior to the Catholick faith in point of certaintie, but onely in univerſalitie. Thirdly, the Church, according to my Adverſary hath its power of binding to faith by a Generall Council with the Popes confirmation of the Decrees: then let us know by what Council all the parts of Scripture were confirmed by a Generall Council with the Popes conſent for the firſt ſix hundred years; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what might be put in as towards the uſe of ſome parts of the Apocryphall books: but it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they were canonized as to faith; nor any of the Canonicall books declared by them, as <hi>quo ad nos,</hi> authentick. For they were wont to meddle with little but emergent queſtions; whereas of thoſe parts of Scripture which were generally received, there was no queſtion whether they were the word of God. And being not received by the authoritie
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:40740:245"/> of a Council eſtabliſhing them, what ground have thoſe who differ from us, to receive them; ſince they ſay, the infallible Authoritie is in the Church Repreſentative with the Popes confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He goes on. <hi>And it muſt be a far ſurer diſcoverie than that by which we diſcover the Sun by his light, for this diſcovery can onely ground a naturall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie: the other muſt ground a ſupernaturall, not certainty, but infallibilitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſupernaturall habit of faith hath it felf more to intelligence than to ſcience. Intelligence is known to be that naturall habit, whereby the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is diſpoſed to aſſent to the truth of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when the terms of thoſe principles are known. And faith doth beare more proportion to this, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſupernaturall habit (in regard of cauſe) whereby we are diſpoſed to believe ſupernaturall verities; whereof the firſt is, by our opinion, that the Scripture is the word of God; taking the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture materially. Now as the principles naturall are ſeen through their own light by the naturall habit of intelligence: ſo are the ſupernatural principles ſeen through their own light by the ſupernaturall habit of faith. And as certainly as I ſee the Sun by its light with mine eye; ſo certainly do I ſee the truth of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall principles by the naturall habit of intelligence: and as certainly as I ſee the veritie of naturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by intelligence, ſo do I ſee ſupernaturall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities by the ſupernaturall habit of faith; yet not ſo evidently as I ſee the Sun by its light, or naturall principles through their light. But it ſeems by my Adverſary, that this will not ſerve, for he urgeth not onely for a <hi>certainty</hi> but <hi>infallibilitie.</hi> To this we anſwer, firſt, Take certaintie properly, and I think there is no <hi>fundamentum in re</hi> for this diſtinction.</p>
            <pb n="578" facs="tcp:40740:246"/>
            <p>It may be, becauſe we are wont to uſe the term of infallibilitie to points of faith, we think that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is certain is not infallible: and it is true, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner or meane of certaintie, ſo that whatſoever is certain is not infallible; for ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie ſeems to be more generall: but certainly, whatſoever is to us certaine is alſo infallible, as we take it in a generall ſenſe. But ſecondly, if there be any degree of infallibilitie above certaintie, we have it by this way of Divine faith infuſed by the Spirit of God: becauſe we are moſt ſure of this principle, that God cannot deceive, nor be deceived: therefore what we take upon his word we are moſt certain of, and more than by our own diſcourſe and reaſon; for that is in the nature of it more imperfect. Thirdly, this is not ſo wiſely conſidered, to ſtraine our faith to the higheſt peg of utmoſt infallibilitie, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the ground of it, namely, the Authoritie of the Church: becauſe the Authoritie of it, as it is contradiſtinguiſhed to the Spirit and word, is but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and as it is reſolved into the word by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo it comes into a coincidence with us. Fourthly, whereas he ſometimes upbraided us with an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defect of faith, becauſe we take it not by their way of the Church; it appeares yet, that ſome of our Church have in caſe of martyrdome held the faith of Scripture, and of points taken from thence, as infallibly as they have held Scripture upon tenure of the Church. And it ſeems ours did not hold the Scripture, or the points upon the authoritie of the Church; for they differed from the Ponteficians unto the death, about the Church and about points of Doctrine, which the Papiſt urged, they denied; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were Doctrines of their Church. Now, according to the Pontifician argument, if they had received the Scripture by the Authoritie of the
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:40740:246"/> Church, they muſt upon the ſame reaſon have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved every Doctrine propoſed by the Church. And therefore, it ſeems, they had a faith of Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible without the Roman infallibilitie. Secondly, the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the Church is to them the efficient of faith. But the Spirit of God ſpeaks alſo in the Scripture. If not, how do they prove, that the Spirit of God ſpeakes in the Church? if it does, then may we believe him at firſt word and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, as to the Church.</p>
            <p>As to what he ſaith, <hi>ſecondly</hi> that he <hi>hath ſhewed in</hi> his <hi>laſt chap. ſecond Num.</hi> that a review of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Council untill they be reſolved into the rule of Scripture, doth <hi>open a wide gap to hereſie,</hi> I need ſay no more than what hath been ſaid in anſwer thereunto. His meer ſaying ſo doth not ſurely make it ſo: nor is it probable, for it doth not open a gap to hereſie materiall; becauſe Scripture is the rule of truth: nor yet to hereſie formall, becauſe it may be done without oppoſition to the Councils. For ſimple diſſent doth not include formall oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But yet further he ſaith. <hi>And for your importance of the matter I will here further declare in an example which hereafter will ſtand me in much uſe. Let us take an Arrian Cobler to this man. This your Doctrine giveth the finall review of the Council of Nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, (I muſt interpoſe in the ſeverall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his ſtorie of the caſe) it doth, but how? It doth not give a review by way of authoritie to others: but he is to take his own libertie for his own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in point of faith. Otherwiſe he believes he knows not what, and ſo in proportion he comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cenſure of Chriſt, upon the Samaritan wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in the 4. of St. <hi>John</hi> the 22. Ye worſhip ye
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:40740:247"/> know not what. If the woman was not to be ruled by the judgement of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> why is a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to be ruled by the authoritie of others; ſince, ſimply, the authoritie of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> was as good as the authoritie of others: and therefore our faith muſt be reſolved into ſome higher ground than the authoritie of men.</p>
            <p>He goes on in his caſe. <hi>And you give him leave af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath peruſed the definitions of this Council (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining God the Son to be of the ſelf ſame individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubſtance with his Father) to examine them untill he find them reſolved into the infallible rule of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, we ſay he may take his own liberty to do ſo. But alſo we ſay, he ought to conferre with thoſe who are learned, that he may more eaſily finde the ſenſe of Scripture, the advice he takes from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doth not determine his aſſent: but diſpoſeth it. It doth point him to it, but he muſt ſee it with his own ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He doth examine them and chiefly how they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that text,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. John the 10. chap. 30. verſe.</note> 
               <hi>I and my Father are one, on which text you afterwards confeſſe the infallibilitie of this definition to be chiefly grounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> So did St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> profeſſe, as I told him in my laſt rejoinder, and he doth not ſay any thing in deniall. But as to the point as being clear in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there are other texts plain enough, as in the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John</hi> the fifth chap. the twentieth verſe, <hi>in his ſon Jeſus Christ, this is the true God.</hi> Indeed the whole verſe is for our purpoſe. <hi>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding, that we ſhould know him that is true. And we are in him that is true, in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true God.</hi> He hath given us a mind that we ſhould know. Here is faith infuſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:40740:247"/> we know him, and therefore is not this faith an effect of the authoritie of the Church. And this ſon is here ſaid to be the true God, not onely God nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupatively, as the Arrians and Socinians: but the true God. So <hi>Bartholomeus Petrus,</hi> who makes the Supplement to <hi>Eſtius's</hi> Comment upon the Epiſtles, and ſubjects all to the holy Roman Church; <hi>Et ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ominus etiam Filius ab Apoſtolo verbis expreſſis nominatur verus Deus parte hujus verſus quarta quae ſequitur, hic est verus Deus.</hi> So he. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo the Son is named by the Apoſtle in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words the true God in the fourth part of this verſe, this is the true God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now in the examen of the conformitie of this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this text, the Arrian Cobler by his poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is eaſily able to ſee (that which a wiſer man would yet ſee ſooner) that he is put upon a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to inquire how God the Son and his Father are one; whether it be by affection onely, as Arrians hold, or one in the ſelf ſame individuall Subſtance, as the Council defineth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; what then? This is no other than that which ſtands with our duty of obedience to that precept in the firſt Ep. to the <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. Prove all things; hold faſt that which is good. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were we to reſt in the definition of Councils, yet ſhould we be put upon inquiry into the ſenſe of their words which would make a trouble and a difference, as the words of the Trent Council did to <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Viga.</hi> And therefore if he could prejudice our cauſe with perplexities of ambiguities; neither are they certain, by their own Councils, which ſenſe to ſtand to, ſince theſe learned men ſo eagerly combated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on different ſenſes of the words of the Council up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Decrees about Free-will and Predeſtination: and though they had their <hi>intereſſe</hi> in the Council
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:40740:248"/> for learning and eſtimation; yet, it ſeems, did not know the onely ſenſe and true ſcope of the Synod, as is ſaid of them in the Hiſtory of the Trent Council. p. 216.</p>
            <p>My Adverſary goes on. <hi>And inquiring this he cals to mind that other text, John the</hi> 17.21. <hi>Where Chriſt prayeth, all his Diſciples may be one thing, as thou Father in me and I in thee.</hi> So then let him proceed with the caution of this rule, <hi>res non eſt ſubject a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni, ſed ſermo rei.</hi> The thing is not ſerviceable to the ſpeech, but the ſpeech to the thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here will the Cobler ſay (becauſe he hath been often inſtructed by his own Doctors) Chriſt who ſaid, I and my Father are one thing, demandeth that his Diſciples may be one thing as he and his Father are one thing; but he doth not demand, that his Diſciples may be all one thing in the ſelf ſame individuall ſubſtance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (he concludes) Chriſt is not one thing in the ſelf ſame individuall ſubſtance with his Father, but one thing in affection onely, as his Diſciples might come to be one thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But this Cobler if he had more mind to finde truth in Scripture than his own opinion, might goe on and ſee, that the Jews (who were like to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words of Chriſt, as obſerving what was ſaid by him to them) underſtood Chriſt not to ſpeak that they were one by way of affection. For becauſe of this ſpeech they took up ſtones to caſt at him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he being a man made himſelf God, as it is in the 33 ver. of the 10. ch. of St. <hi>John.</hi> Which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his words our Saviour did not in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes deny; although he ſeemed to wave that ſenſe; and yet alſo in effect brought it in by an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the 38 ver. Secondly, although, if there had been no other text concerning Chriſt's Divinity, there would not have been ſo clear a concluſion from the text, of the Divinity of Chriſt: yet if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:40740:248"/> it with other paſſages of the Scriptures, we may well believe that ſenſe, and alſo if the text doth not afford that ſenſe, how ſhall we believe a Council, when the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> (as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaid) ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this text thrice againſt the Arrians? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this exception againſt the ſufficient clearneſſe of Scripture in this point muſt be withdrawn, or elſe they muſt condemne themſelves, becauſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> determined the point not by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but by the text. And therefore cannot the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſay (as my Adverſary prompts him) <hi>falſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this definition of the Council which cannot be reſolved into the infallible word of God, in which all things neceſſary to Salvation (as this point is) are plainly ſet down, as this place is not.</hi> My Adverſary firſt might have ſpoken more moderately; not <hi>falſe is it therefore which the Council hath defined,</hi> but, not neceſſary, becauſe the ſenſe of the words may be ſuch when they are ſpoken betwixt God or him and his Diſciples, therefore they are ſuch between his Father and him, this is no rationall inference. <hi>Duo cum idem dicunt, non est idem.</hi> When two ſay the ſame thing, it is not the ſame thing ſaid. So when one ſaies the ſame thing in divers reſpects, it is not the ſame in ſenſe preſently, becauſe in words. And if it be ſaid, this is the queſtion, whether it be ſaid in divers reſpects? we anſwer, that we do not here ſpeake of divers reſpects formall, but objective, for even according to the Principles of the Arrian, Chriſt is not an ordinary man, as appeares by their poſition, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there was a time when he was not, and therefore there is no reaſon to expound the words in the ſame ſenſe when they are applied to God and Chriſt, as when they are applied to God, or Chriſt and the Diſciples. Secondly, the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Council is not falſe, if this point can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:40740:249"/> be reſolved into the infallible word of God; but my opinion is falſe; unleſſe he thinks my opinion is the ſame with the definition of the Council: and if ſo, then the Council holds, that all things neceſſary are reſolvable into plain Scripture; and if ſo, then by his opinion he ſhould ſtand to this definition; and if ſo, he ſhould yield the cauſe. Thirdly, the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians have no ſuch cauſe to ſtand ſo punctually for the neceſſary belief of the Divinity of the Son of God, becauſe according to their Champion, <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> in his fifth <hi>b. de Mediatore,</hi> he holds, that Chriſt is not a Mediator according to both natures, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the humane nature, <hi>ratione formalis principii,</hi> for though he ſays, Chriſt be a Mediator according to both natures, <hi>ratione ſuppoſiti,</hi> and as <hi>Principium quod;</hi> yet is not his Divinity ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as by being Mediator in regard of his Divine nature, as the formall principle, and as <hi>a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium quo:</hi> becauſe thus the Divine nature is more neceſſary <hi>per ſe.</hi> But thirdly, either the definition of the Council is true or falſe; if true, then is it for us; if falſe, then how ſhall we truſt any?</p>
            <p>He goes on. <hi>For this is the plaineſt place. And yet conferring it with the other, I finde it not evidently agreeing with the definition of the Council, but rather evidently againſt it; by which I conclude (in this my Review) the definition of the Council to be falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whether this be the plaineſt place is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince there are other texts, unto which this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie is not incident, as, beſides that named before, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt; where the three Divine Perſons have one name, namely, one authoritie and therefore eſſence, and this text doth not a little puzzle the Socinian. And yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:40740:249"/> if the ſenſe of the text were, that Chriſt and his Father were one in affection, it doth not follow therefore, that it is evidently rather againſt the definition of the Council: becauſe they may be ſaid to be one in affection, ſince they are one in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that which affirms ſo much doth not alwaies exclude more; therefore unleſſe it were ſaid they were one in affection onely, it would not be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently againſt the Council. But if the text, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the other, did make this ſenſe of being one in affection, it would not import excluſively, that they are one in affection onely. Therefore though the text did not inferre the Councils meaning; yet, upon the ſuppoſition, the Arrian Cobler could not conclude the definition of the Council to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe, ſince the text doth not conclude a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of that poſition: becauſe to be one in affection, and to be one in eſſence, it doth not imply; for if they be one in eſſence, they are one in affection. So then, if my Adverſary makes the Cobler to conclude the definition of the Council falſe, as to the matter, that the ſon of God is coeſſentiall with the Father, it is inconſequent: if reſpectively to the text, whereby they prove it, then it is indeed conſequent, that the definition of the Council was falſe, but then we make a certain Concluſion of it for our uſe, that the definition of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was not infallible. And if ſo, my Adverſary is undone.</p>
            <p>And now alſo I take leave to be even with my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. He takes the Arrian Cobler for his example. I take the Popiſh Collier. To this man the Roman Doctors (as my Adverſary thinks) give no finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of his faith, but in the Church. They give him no leave to peep into Scripture for the ſetling his belief. Or if his Doctors do very tenderly let fall to him any intimation of Scripture ſo far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:40740:250"/> by it the infallibilitie of his Church, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which ſeems to ſpeak moſt for their turne, and is in the mouth of all of them, namely, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>I ſay unto thee thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church, &amp;c. through the nineteenth v.</hi> Well, but will his Dctors give him leave to examin this Interpretation of the text with any other? Dare they? Very hardly. They tell him, he may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt his faith and ſoule in the Authority of the Church. But here is the queſtion, whether the Church doth rightly interpret the text on their own behalf. If they ſay, it is plain that that is the ſenſe; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, then may other texts be plain alſo for us. Yea, it is not plain: for the ancient Fathers of the Church have differed from them upon the expoſition, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Popiſh Collier ſhould have leave for once from the inquiſition, by a diſpenſation of the Pope, to inquire, as well as the Arrian Cobler, into the ſenſe of the text, and therefore <hi>by his poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding (which yet a wiſer man would ſee ſooner)</hi> he doth diſcerne, by comparing it with the twentieth of <hi>John.</hi> 21, 22, 23. ver. That it is not reaſonable to expound the former text of ſuch an authority to be given to St <hi>Peter,</hi> which was not in the latter given to the reſt of the Apoſtles; ſpecially ſince <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is wiſely carefull, that the Princedome of the Church ſhould not be given to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> till after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, leſt St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Succeſſors ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from danger of ſucceeding him in the deniall of his Maſter. Now then, if equall authoritie be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all the Apoſtles, (as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> plainly alſo in his <hi>Tract at. de ſimplicitate Praelatorum, hoc erant u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique et caeteri Apoſtoli quod fuit</hi> Petrus, <hi>pari con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortio praediti et honoris et poteſtatis;</hi> and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaies that Chriſt gave all the Apoſtles, after his Reſurrection, <hi>parem poteſtatem,</hi> equall authority)
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:40740:250"/> how ſhall he collect from the other, that to be the Prince of the Apoſtles, and to be ordinary Paſtor of the whole Church was given to St. <hi>Peter?</hi> Now then is this Collier at a plunge, he doth not ſee it in the former text by conferring it with the latter; and therefore he concludes (according to my Adverſary for the Cobler) that this doth not agree with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Doctors, <hi>but rather is evidently againſt it, by which he concludes (in this his review) the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</hi> Roman Doctors to <hi>be falſe.</hi>

            <p>And yet <hi>this is the plaineſt text</hi> for them. And therefore let the Popiſh Collier be convinced <hi>by ſome clearer Argument out of Scripture,</hi> to believe as the Church believeth: or elſe, <hi>to the eternall good of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſouls,</hi> confeſſe, that if you give not private men leave finally to reſolve themſelves in Scripture, the Roman <hi>can finde no means</hi> upon earth to put an end unto the main controverſies, the Church <hi>not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for this end:</hi> unleſſe we ſhould take the Church as commending us to Scripture for our direction, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of being accounted</hi> not Chriſtians. For how are we bound, upon pain of Damnation, to believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt without that which is written in Scripture?</p>
            <p>But it will be ſaid, that the Popiſh Collier ſhould not have leave given him to examine the Scripture's ſenſe, no more than the Arrian Cobler ſhould have leave to examine the Councils definition: but both ſhould abſolutely reſt in the definition of a Council. To this we anſwer ſeverall things. Firſt, it is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prejudice to the Roman cauſe, that they account blind obedience to the Church, a duty. This darke lantern, that none ſhould ſee them but their own men, breeds great ſuſpition. The Roman cannot perſwade the Arrian to reſt in a Council, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Council will not make an end with all of all
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:40740:251"/> controverſies. Thirdly; if the Arrian were to reſt in a Council, he would ſay the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> were as conſiderable to him as the Council of Nice to the <hi>Homorſiaſts.</hi> Fourthly, General Councils, for the pureſt times of the Church, were not celebrated: and therefore this is not the univerſall way of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and abſolute determinative of faith. Fifthly, we have no prejudice againſt the four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; we embrace them, and they make no prejudice againſt us, therefore if we hold, as they hold, points of faith, we are as ſaveable as they. Sixthly, the <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Council they have for them is the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and yet the Popiſh Collier cannot <hi>acquieſce</hi> in that: becauſe (although they ſay it was) yet he may doubt whether it was a free Generall Council. And I hope, ſince my Adverſary ſaies we muſt take infallibility from the Generall Council, we may have leave to examine whether that was a free Generall Council. And here we muſt contradiſtinguiſh the Church unto the Council, and we muſt not believe the Council for the Church; for then the infallibilitie would lie in the Church, not in the Council. Well, and muſt we take the Councill to be right and good from it ſelf? ſuppoſe we were to receive undiſputedly the Decrees of faith in a Generall Council; yet we muſt be aſſured firſt, that this was a Generall free Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, then it is left us to examine the Council, though not the definitions: for if the Scripture cannot prove it ſelf, as they ſuppoſe, then the Councill cannot, and therefore the Popiſh Collier may examine the Council. And how ſhall he content himſelf about the Councill in the generalitie of it, ſince there was ſo few perſons in it, ſometimes but forty three, Legates and Abbots being put in: and ſome titular Biſhops onely, ſometimes forty eight; for a good while not above ſixty; the Prelates of other Nations not there;
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:40740:251"/> not a Biſhop or Divine of all <hi>Germany</hi> there; in the yeare 1546 no French Biſhop could be there, and therefore no Generall Council. As the French King ſaid, page 314. and by reaſon of the paucitie of the perſons then there, forty eight Biſhops and five Cardinalls; and not one of the Prelates remarkable for learning; and ſome of them Lawyers, and ſome Courtiers, the Decrees of the Council about <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall books and making authenticall a tranſlation differing from the Originall,</hi> did diſpleaſe in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> as it is ſet down in the Hiſtory of the Trent Council, p. 163. * And for the freeneſſe of it, the Collier might deny that by ſeverall paſſages: for abſolute autority was given to the Legats of the Pope to procreed without conſent of Council, p. 113. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations from the liberty of the Council noted, p. 232. the Biſhop of <hi>Fieſole</hi> complained of to the Pope for reaſonable freedom, p. 167, 8. Amongſt the three things the Pope admoniſhed his Legates, one was, <hi>to take beed that by no means the Popes authority be diſputed on, p.</hi> 164, And yet this is the point which formally denominates the Popiſh Religion. And his being Head of the univerſall Church, as he preſumes, is the point which denominates their Church the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick. Yea, it was proteſted againſt by the French King; which was of force againſt it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome <hi>prohibentis conditio potior,</hi> as p. 320. And therefore cannot the Popiſh Collier finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve his faith in a Council upon its own conciliarie authority. And aſſuredly, if the Arrian Cobler and the Popiſh Collier were both to diſpute the ſame point; one by the Scripture, the other by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the Cobler would ſooner convince the Collier by Scripture, which he doth acknowledge as certain, than the Collier the Cobler by the Council, which he doth not acknowledge ſo: yea, if the Collier and the Cobler were equally diſpoſed to finde
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:40740:252"/> truth indifferently to their opinions, the Cobler might ſooner ſettle his mind in Scripture, than the Collier in a Council; for the Cobler hath no more to do than to finde out the ſenſe of Scripture, and then he is ſatisfied: but the Collier, when he hath found out the ſenſe of the Council, is not ſatisfied; becauſe, if he were aſſured that a free and generall Council was infallible, he might yet doubt of the <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> whether this Council were ſo. But it is falſe in theſe, that a generall Council, though free, is infallible, and that we are bound to believe ſo; for why then would not the Pope put the main que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of queſtion? Either he did ſuſpect the point himſelf, or did ſuſpect his own Subjects in the Council, or did ſuſpect, that it did not bind unto neceſſary belief, or elſe he was deceived in point of prudence, (which is moſt unlikely) to have that waved.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, in reaſoning, would prove a Schiſme, <hi>a dicto ſecundum quid.</hi> Becauſe I deny them to be <hi>finall</hi> in your ſenſe, therefore I deny them to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in all ſenſe, is not conſequent. It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the deniall of one ſpecies to the deniall of all. Finall definitions, as to humane Tribunals, I acknowledge them: but finall ſo, as to exclude the examination of them by Scripture, I deny. Final, as to peace, and not to be refractary, I grant: but finall, as to neceſſary aſſent upon the Councils account, I deny. That we may finde truth by them, I yield; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo many abilities united with Gods bleſſing, may be like to pitch upon that true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which may determine the judgement unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:40740:252"/> aſſent. As by the conflict of hard things ſparkes of fire do break out: ſo by the induſtrious diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of opinions, truth may appear eminently. But we cannot conclude the definitions, intuitively, and <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo facto,</hi> infallible. And why ſhould we be obliged to ſtand to their declaration of truth, as if they did alſo make it to be truth? And why ſhould we ſtand to their Concluſions, when their diſcourſe is fallible, unleſſe they go by Scripture? And if they by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture examine opinions, why ſhould not we by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture examine their definitions, as to our ſelves? Which ſhould be laſt in the determination, Council, or Scripture, when Councils begin by it, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with it? Therefore I do not make them in no ſenſe finall; or none. That which follows, <hi>Now ſurely it is cleare. &amp;c.</hi> unto the end of the number, how little ſtrength of reaſon hath it? This, in effect, was anſwered immediately before. My Adverſary does us right in confeſſing our acknowledgement of the firſt four Generall Councils. And alſo may we confeſſe, that we think <hi>they thought they had all pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of power and authority from God to define, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to determine thoſe Controverſies;</hi> but what then? 1. What if they thought ſo? We have liberty by our principles to think that inconcludent, becauſe we hold them not infallible in their judgement. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought they had ſuch power, therefore they had it; unleſſe we ſhould hold them infallible, as we do not. Neither is this thought of ours, that they might think amiſs of ſuch power to be in them, any prejudice to our acknowledgement of thoſe firſt four General Councils; becauſe this opinion of theirs is no part of their determinations. Secondly, we diſtinguiſh: All plenitude of power is taken either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplicatively, or ſpecificatively for all that power which belongs to the whole Church; the former, if
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:40740:253"/> their opinion of themſelves were infallible, would ſerve his turne: but we deny that they thought they had all power ſo; and if they did think ſo, we think they did not think right: the latter power they might think they had and not think amiſſe, but this ſerves not the turn; for all authority of the Church doth not bind us to receive the definitions thereof ſo as to ſink all examination of the truth thereof by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Have not other courts a plenitude of power to hear and determine cauſes; and yet are ſometimes defective in point of law? Their fallibility doth not proceed from want of power or authoritie, but from want of judgement or will to give a right ſentence. And yet their cenſures alſo proceed. And therefore the excommunications (which my Adverſary objects to me) may neither import their faith of their infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie, nor yet wrong <hi>to all ſuch as ſhould gainſay what they had defined and determined, if error and falſitie and contradiction to Scripture could be found in their definitions and determinations;</hi> for firſt it is not fallibilitie of ſentence that doth the wrong, but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, either by ignorance, (and ſo <hi>ignorantia in Judice reputatur pro dolo</hi>) or elſe by wilfulneſſe, (which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally makes the injurie, becauſe intended.) Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the excommunications proceed againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for an outward act of obſtinacie, and not for a diſſent of judgment (for <hi>cogitationis poenam in noſtro foro nemo luit</hi>) ſo then there is no wrong to him that gainſays by excommunication; for that ſimply he might keep his judgment. And alſo thirdly, the Judge though he judgeth not well, yet may do well, if he judgeth with competent knowledge and due inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and therefore is it no injury if he does his beſt, ſince God hath not thought fit on the behalfe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, to diſannull humane Judicatures for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmities.</p>
            <pb n="593" facs="tcp:40740:253"/>
            <p>His Anſwer to my inſtance of the Bereans (who ſearched the Scripture daily to ſee whether that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid was true) my Adverſary doth referre to another Chapter. We ſtay his leiſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas you adde fourthly,<note place="margin">Num. 6.</note> that the deciſions of the Church though unprovided of infallibilitie, do yet oblige unto peace, though their judgement cannot claime an undiſputed aſſent, yet the power they have from Chriſt doth require an undiſturbance in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, you teach by words what the deed of your glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformers have notoriouſly gainſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is readily anſwered, that Reformers may be glorious as to the generall effect, though it's poſſible for them to be extravagant <hi>in modo.</hi> Sober buſineſſes may be managed with too much heate. Secondly, whereas he ſuppoſeth that our glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers did notoriouſly gainſay the whole Church, I deny it; and if they did not gaineſay the whole Church, it doth not come home to his purpoſe: for he is upon the authority of the whole Church. They did gainſay the Roman Church, but not the whole Church. That which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaid in his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> is yet for our uſe; <hi>ſi authoritas queritur, orbis major est urbe,</hi> if authority be lookt after, the world is greater than a City, which was alſo ſpoken in application to <hi>Rome.</hi> And put caſe there were no ſort of Chriſtians that did not profeſſe obedience to the Roman Church, when thoſe glorious Reformers did firſt appeare, yet it cannot be rationally ſaid by the Romaniſt, that they did gainſay the whole Church, becauſe the Romaniſt doth take the root of his Church from the primitive times; which thoſe Reformers did not gainſay. So then as we deny to them that they were all the whole Church, when the Reformers did begin: ſo if they had, it would be nothing as to the gainſaying of the whole Church,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:40740:254"/> becauſe the whole Church in their ſence doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all times, and ſpecially the primitive; which they did not contradict. And ſurely if the Romaniſt proves his Church by conformitie to the Primitive, (otherwiſe he hath the leſſe reaſon for himſelf) then muſt he interpretatively grant, that there is more authority of the Primitive Church, than of that preſent Roman. And ſo then if the Reformers gainſaid not the primitive, they gainſaid not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick in the beſt part of it for time; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which the preſent Roman doth moſt, as they ſay, depend upon. Thirdly, therefore we do not take our Religion from thoſe Reformers as being worne into their words; and therefore we do not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Chriſtianity by any ſingular perſons: we might take hints from them to conſider thoſe Doctrines which they preached, and conferring them with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and Scripture, we believe them to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall; and ſo is our Church, by <hi>Tertullian's</hi> rule in his book of Preſcriptions, ch. 32. <hi>In eadem fide conſpirantes non minus Apoſtolicae deputantur pro conſanguinitate Doctrinae,</hi> thoſe Churches that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in the faith are not leſſe accounted Apoſtolical for the conſanguinity of Doctrine. Fourthly, thoſe Reformers, even according to my Adverſaries Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, did not oppoſe themſelves to the authoritie of the whole Church: becauſe, according to him, the authority of the Church is onely binding in a Council with the Popes conſent; and no Generall Council can be found which did eſtabliſh the points of Doctrine and Diſcipline wherein we differ, before thoſe Reformers did ſhew themſelves: for the Trent Councill (which alſo is not a generall Council) was after their beginning, as is known, and it was called upon their occaſion. Fifthly, as for our Reformation in <hi>England</hi> from the incroachments of the Court of
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:40740:254"/> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> it was firſt made by men of the Roman faith. So then my Adverſary gets nought by this exception. And if the Romaniſts object to us reformation in Doctrine againſt the Church, as in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, we reply, as before, that we did not oppoſe the Church Catholick, we left the Roman as they left the Catholick Church. The whole is greater than the part, and therefore had we reaſon to leave them. <hi>Omne reducitur ad princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> which is a rule of <hi>Aquinas.</hi> We are in Doctrine as the Church was in the times of the Apoſtles. Our defence is in <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his book of <hi>Praeſor.</hi> 35. ch. <hi>Poſterior noſtra res non eſt; imo omnibus prior eſt, &amp;c. Our cauſe is not more moderne, but more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient than all. This ſhall be the Teſtimony of truth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, obtaining the ſuperiority.</hi> Ab Apoſtolis utique non damnatur, imo defenditur; <hi>it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Apoſtles, nay, it is defended. This ſhall be the indication of propriety: for thoſe who do not condemne it who have condemned whatſoever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous, do ſhew it to be theirs, and therefore do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond inconvenience, which he urgeth, of my Principles, to draw me to his, is none. <hi>Secondly, ſeeing that a Generall Council (as you in your firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per confeſſe) is the higheſt Court on earth to hear and determine controverſies, &amp;c. What then? unleſſe, all were bound to confirme and ſubſcribe to erroneous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, and all Preachers were ſilenced, and obliged not to open their mouths againſt their errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he attributes to me, as if I ſaid it, or my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion did inferre it; whereas neither is true. Nay, nor did he find in my papers, that erroneous definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Generall Council (though the higheſt Court) are to be <hi>accepted peaceably, reverently, and without diſturbance;</hi> namely, ſo as to accept them in aſſent
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:40740:255"/> as true; for that would be impoſſible: they may be accepted, and reverently, and without diſturbance, as to peace in not oppoſing; though not as to faith in ſubmiſſion of Judgement: and becauſe they may thus be accepted, will it therefore follow, that we are therefore <hi>bound to confirme and ſubſcribe to erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous definitions?</hi> By no meanes. I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I uſed the terme of <hi>accepting;</hi> and yet if I did, it might be conſtrued <hi>in ſenſu commodo,</hi> ſo as not to diſturb the peace of the Church, and quietly to endure the cenſure. But there is a vaſt difference betwixt not oppoſing and conforming or ſubſcribing. For not to oppoſe, is negative: to conforme, or ſubſcribe, is a poſitive act. Not to oppoſe, reſpects the definition as a publick act; to conforme, or ſubſcribe, reſpects it as true, which I cannot do, ſuppoſing it erroneous. Not to oppoſe, regards the Judgement of the Church as authoritative: to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme or ſubſcribe, regards the judgement of the Church, as at leaſt, not erring in the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And as for that he ſaies, that by my confeſſion, all <hi>Preachers are ſilenced and obliged not to open their mouths againſt theſe errors.</hi> I anſwer firſt, by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the matter of the error. If the matter of the error be not great, as not deſtroying an article of faith, it might be better quietly to tollerate it, than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to ſpeak againſt it: if the matter of the error be repugnant to an article of faith, then we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the manner of ſpeaking againſt it; and we ſay we may ſoberly refer it to another general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, if any be in view. If not, we may ſpeak the truth poſitively without oppoſition to the authoritie of the Church, ſo as to vilify or contemn it. Yea, further, if the Council be free and general, it being ſo qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not like to erre in any decree repugnant to a
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:40740:255"/> main article of faith: and therefore the queſtion about ſpeaking againſt it, is in this caſe well taken away. And yet further, admitting, and not granting, that ſuch a Council ſhould erre in defining that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an article of faith; yet muſt my Adverſary have ſuppoſed by his principles that the truth contrary to this error hath been eſtabliſhed by ſome other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; or elſe, according to him, the Church hath not ſufficiently provided how to ſettle us infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly in matters of faith; ſince, according to him, we muſt reſolve our faith ultimately in the Decrees of Generall Councils, and then Council will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Council, and therefore will not a Council be a ground of faith, becauſe one may contradict ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and alſo we may ſpeak by vertue of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Council againſt the error of the latter. And therefore <hi>the whole Church of God</hi> is not <hi>in a pitifull caſe</hi> by any thing of what I ſaid in reverence to Councils without abſolute obedience. But to be ſure the Church would be in a pitifull caſe, if indeed we were bound to receive intuitively all definitions of Councils in whatſoever matters; for then ſhould we be bound to ſubmit our conſcience to a Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our conſcience, ſince it is not yet proved infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and this makes for the inward act a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for the outward, hypocriſie. And ſurely, if that which is moſt hard is moſt eaſily broken, (as was ſaid by one in the Trent Council) then that he urgeth is eaſily anſwered: for there is, to be ſure, leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in not ſpeaking againſt that which is falſe, as he would have me ſay; than in yielding to all as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true, as he would have me believe.</p>
            <p>And therefore that which follows returnes with more force upon my Adverſary, <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi> A pitifull thing it would be, if the Church were bound to believe all definitions of a Council, which
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:40740:256"/> are not yet proved, nor ever will be, not to be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and conſequently ſome that may be falſe, <hi>which being by command from the higheſt authoritie upon earth preached by ſo many, and not ſo much as to</hi> be conſiwered <hi>by one, would needs increaſe to a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full height. Would any wiſe Law-maker proceed thus, if they could helpe it as well as Chriſt could by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in</hi> his word written <hi>that infallibilitie,</hi> which my Adverſary hath confeſſed, or muſt, that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had and ſhall have.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the infallibility of the Church for two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares before Scripture was written, and that which this Church of Chriſt had before all the whole canon of the new Teſtament was finiſhed, which was for the firſt forty yeares of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This we have ſpoken to ſufficiently before. And this doth at moſt inferre (upon a ſuppoſition, that the Church was for that time infallible, which yet we grant not) a poſſibilitie of it to be infallible ſtill. It doth not inferre an actuall infallibilitie ſtill. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did ſo then, therefore he did ſo after the word was written, is as good an Argument as this; becauſe God made an extroardinary light for the time before the Sun was created, therefore we muſt not now be directed by the light of the Sun. As if becauſe God did ſufficiently rule his Church without general Councils for the firſt three hundred yeares, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould not make uſe of Councils now. And then we ſay, ſecondly, we muſt not compare the two thouſand yeares before any word was written but onely with the time of the Church when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was not written (as for fortie years after Chriſt untill the Canon was finiſhed) and ſo it bears ſome proportion: but it is not to be compared with the other times of the Church after the finiſhing of the Canon. For then the word was to be the ordinary
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:40740:256"/> ſtanding rule, without Prophets or Apoſtles. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was there any thing neceſſary conſigned by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church which was not put into writing? This cannot be ſaid; becauſe then God ſhould have provided for his Church worſe afterwards by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And if it be ſaid that the writing of the word doth not exclude the word not written, which is tradition, let them tell me why, when all was in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition before, ſomewhat was put into writing, and ſomewhat left in the way of tradition. And then alſo let them tell me how that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould be true, <hi>St. John the fifth.</hi> 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them you think to have eternall life, and they are they which teſtifie of me.,</hi> if any thing neceſſary were left in tradition, how could they have eternall life in the Scriptures? So then, ſince all that was neceſſary was committed to writing; why then was not that whereby the Church was ruled for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>years before the Canon was finiſhed</hi> written alſo as well as before? and then your tradition (which you contradiſtinguiſh to Scripture) is evacuated. Or let me know why we may not as well deny the Roman traditions in point of faith after the finiſhing of the Canon, as our Saviour did the traditions of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes after their Canon was finiſhed? And why then ſhould we not apply to them that of our Saviour to the Jews. St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. In vaine do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine the traditions of men. Might not the Phariſees as well have put their traditions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Miſhna,</hi> which (as the tradition is) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by word of mouth from God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> from <hi>Joſhuah</hi> to the ſeventie, from them to the Church? And fourthly, my Adverſary ſpeakes this in favour of Generall Councils; does he not? If he does not, his diſcourſe doth not well cohere, if he does, he does not conſider, that for the
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:40740:257"/> two thouſand yeares there was no generall Council, nor for the firſt forty of the Chriſtian Church. Nor much for the firſt three hundred years. And what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence can be then drawn from his words againſt me for my deniall of being obliged abſolutely to Councils? If the Church were infallible, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Councils, it would contradict me, who ſay, that the Church is not infallible, even by Councils: but ſince he ſayes, now the Church is infallible by Councils, if it were infallible without Councils, it would contradict him, who ſays, it is infallible in and by Councils: becauſe he placeth the infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Councils, ſo as that he will not ſtand to any infallibilitie of the Church without them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 7.</note>In the ſeventh Number he doth indeavour to free me from the fear of hypocriſie <hi>in differing by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act from our inward act of belief.</hi> But his indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is not ſufficient. To differ by my outward act of ſubſcribing from my inward act of belief, is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie: but if I ſubſcribe to that which I do not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto as true, I muſt differ by my outward act from my inward act: and therefore will it be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. To the aſſumption he would now give me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, by perſwading me that my inward act of aſſent may well go along with my outward act of ſubſcribing. His reaſon is this, <hi>for any wiſe man may inwardly perſwade himſelf, that although I, by my force of wit, cannot ſee how ſuch a point defined by a whole General Council ſhould be true; yet, if I have wit, I cannot but perſwade my ſelf, even according to humane wiſdome, that ſo grave a judgement of a whole Council is far more likely to ſee the truth, than my private judgement, and therefore rather to be interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly imbraced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And is this all he can ſay to move me to
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:40740:257"/> change my opinion? Firſt he ſeems to ſuppoſe that we cannot ſee ſufficient reaſon in all the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Council; and ſo far he ſpeaks ingenuouſly, becauſe it is a prejudice againſt himſelf. Secondly, there are ſo many doubts of a free generall Council about the morall exiſtence of it, that I had need of ſome Divine faith to believe, that ſuch or ſuch is a free Generall Council. And that there may be ſuch ſcruples of ſuch a Council he himſelf afterwards gives me intimation of. Thirdly, all this I can give you the free uſe of; for it will do me no harme. The diſcourſe is peccant upon the ignorance of the <hi>Elench,</hi> for this is in terms reconcilable to our cauſe; yea, and alſo almoſt all that follows to the end of the number; for they do not prove <hi>a captivating of the ſoul into the obedience of faith, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh;</hi> but at moſt but a diſpoſing of the mind of the perſon againſt oppoſition. As you do conclude, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude above your premiſſes: as you ſhould conclude from your premiſſes before, you can conclude nothing againſt me. For fourthly, all that is ſaid there makes no more than a probability of that to be right which is defined by the Council. For, put caſe it ſeems ſo to all in a generalitie, or to moſt, or to the wiſeſt, and of them to all, or moſt of the wiſer of them, this is but probable, according to <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> account. And then I will deny it, that every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is ſo qualified. If it were, this probabilitie makes but a ſtrong opinion, but not faith. And therefore the Romaniſt doth unadviſedly urge neceſſity of faith upon grounds infallible, before they can give us grounds infallible. And therefore fifthly, as for his <hi>Dilemma,</hi> it will not take. It is this: <hi>Either the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against the definitions of the Council are clear, or not:</hi> if not, they are more likely <hi>to hit upon the truth than I am: if clear and evident, then it is an evident

                  <pb n="602" facs="tcp:40740:259"/> and clear folly in me to thinke, that ſo wiſe an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhould have ſo univerſall a blindneſſe, as that none of them ſhould be able to diſcover that which is cleare and evident even to my ſhort ſight;</hi> alas, how far comes this ſhort of infallible ſatisfaction? And beſides, how many may diſſemble what they ſee? Who ſo blinde as he that will not ſee? If the <hi>Chinites</hi> ſay, they onely themſelves ſee with both eyes; thoſe of <hi>Europe</hi> with one eye; and the reſt of the world with neither; ſurely thoſe of <hi>Europe</hi> who will not ſee are blinde of both eyes. The Council of Trent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them an Oecumenicall Council, if they could ſee better things not cleare, why did they not in all points declare, firſt what was to be held, and then what was to be anathametized? And if they were more like to ſee what is cleare, how came they to abandon the uſe of the cup? Nay, how came they to eſtabliſh a tranſubſtantiation, ſeing our Saviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſecration ſaid plainly, St. <hi>Mark</hi> the 14. the 25. I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine? Was his blood the fruit of the Vine? But ſixthly, to make uſe of his disjunction, <hi>places are either cleare or not,</hi> namely, places of Scripture; if not cleare, no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of a generall Council, ſo as no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be had without clearing the difficulty; if clear, what need then of a Council? we may be ſaved without ſome knowledge: we cannot believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infallibility. Seventhly, let them reconcile this neceſſity of a Council to the ſayings of <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, who ſaid he had abſolute authority; that for himſelf he had no need of inſtruction, becauſe he knew Chriſt did command; that he had no need of a Council, for he himſelf was above all; that he could remedie all inconveniences by his own authority; as is ſaid of him in the Hiſtory of Trent, the fifth book. And therefore my Adverſary or the Pope is
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:40740:259"/> out. All he ſaies here alſo for Councils makes no more than a morall aſſurance; which how much it is leſſe than the certainty of faith, Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> will tell.</p>
            <p>Indeed he ſays, <hi>Again, I may, and ought to know, that the Holy Ghoſt hath promiſed an aſſiſtance to his Church ſufficient to ſecure it from bringing in any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as I ſhall ſhew, chap.</hi> 4. Yes ſurely; if this could be proved, there were no more to be ſaid: <hi>this principle will beat down to the ground all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which an humble ſoule can make.</hi> We confeſſe it, when it is proved. But ſurely this is as much in queſtion as any thing elſe. Untill the ſuppoſition be grown into a proof, we have then yet but pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Arguments to faith. And yet we ſay, ſecondly, if he would have been ſo wiſe as to have ſtated it with a judicious moderation thus, <hi>that we may and ought to know that the Holy Ghoſt hath promiſed an aſſiſtance to his Church ſufficient to ſecure it from brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in any error,</hi> namely, as to deſtroy the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that might have been better endured; but he hath granted that this will not ſerve his purpoſe, as Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> notes, he muſt have the Church ſecure from any error. Theſe Catholicks (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) cannot ſpeake under the forme of univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which is more eaſily contradicted. And we ſuſpend our aſſent untill the demonſtration comes. We <hi>may</hi> not, nor <hi>ought to know</hi> this. We ought not, for we cannot. We cannot but by Scripture. For if they ſay we may know it by the Church, it is the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he prove our oppoſition of Councils in <hi>their moſt fundamentall ground upon which all Councils hitherto have ſtill ſuppoſed themſelves to ſit as Judges, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, it doth not appeare, that all Councils have ſuppoſed themſelves to ſit as Judges, with full
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:40740:260"/> commiſſion to determine ſecurely all controverſies, if the terme [ſecurity] be taken ſecurely from all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And if they have not ſo defined it, that they do ſo ſit as Judges, or ſit as Judges ſo, how ſhall we, according to my Adverſaries principles, believe it, ſince we are to fetch all truth from the Church in a Council? And ſecondly, if all Councils did eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it a Principle, we yet expect a reaſon hereof; ſince neither Pope nor Council have abſolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor both to together to bind our belief. Yea, thirdly, the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did ſit upon as good ground as any other Council: but the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did examine all things by Scripture; ſo in the Hiſtory of the Nicene Council prefixed in a Vatican Edition, it is ſaid, <hi>Rebus itaque in utriuſque partem jactatis, et ad certam Divinarum Scripturarum nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam perpenſis communi omnium ſuffragio</hi> Arrius <hi>et</hi> Euſebius <hi>damnantur.</hi> Things being diſcuſſed on both ſides, and weighed and examined according to the certain rule of Divine Scriptures, by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> are condemned. Therefore are not we to look for a Dictatorian ſentence; but a rationall determination out of Scripture: and if we finde this, this doth oblige <hi>all Chriſtians to conforme to their definitions.</hi> But fourthly, we deny, that we are ſo obliged <hi>by ſuch cenſures as were ſtill held to be ratified in Heaven.</hi> We are not obliged by them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in themſelves, nor becauſe they were ſo held; nay, alſo we deny that they were ſo held to be ratified in Heaven, unleſſe with this limitation, <hi>clave non errante.</hi> Yea again, theſe do not oblige us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our judgement, their power reſpects the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act. Yea again, if ſo. <hi>Honorius</hi> was rightly condemned in the ſixth Generall Council, therefore was an Heretick; yea, and Pope <hi>Vigelius</hi> was an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Heretick for defending the three chap. againſt
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:40740:260"/> the fifth Councill. And the Romaniſts are bound to think the Condemnation juſt, or the Council to be null. And yet that Council thought it ſelf ſufficient in authority without and againſt the Pope; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they all differed from my Adverſary, who ſaies the Council does not bind without the Popes confirmation.</p>
            <p>He ſaies further, <hi>others will tell you divers other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions you have with Councils.</hi> But if he would have had me anſwer for my ſelf, he muſt have told me the particulars. <hi>Generalia non pungunt,</hi> and they make no action. To diſtinguiſh infallibility from their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is no oppoſition, untill infallibility be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly made good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And even in this place you tell all how little you cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Councils, when you charge them with ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.</hi>

               </gap>t may be given <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> to thoſe that may poſſibly ſpeake contradictions; if we meane by credit, a morall reſpect of humane faith: but if he meanes credit of faith Divine, I then grant it, that ſuch credit is not to be given to them which may ſpeake contradictions; for how are they then infallible, as they muſt be by my Adverſary, if they ground faith? As was ſaid of the Miliſians, <hi>Non ſunt ſtulti, ſed poſſunt ſtulta facere;</hi> they are not fools, and yet can do fooliſh things: ſo a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may be wiſe, and yet may ſpeake fooliſh things: and I may give ſome credit to them in generall for their wiſedome; though it be poſſible for them to ſay that which includes a contradiction. Secondly, I may charge Councils with contradictions to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though not to themſelves. For thirdly, I can charge the Council of Trent with contradictions to it ſelf: and the Trent Council was a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in the opinion of my Adverſary; therefore that
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:40740:261"/> grace is voluntarily received, is their opinion; and that yet we cannot know whether we are in ſtate of grace, includes a contradiction; as if we did not know our own will, what it does. This abſurdity was urged by <hi>Catharinus</hi> in the Trent Council. Again (not to ſpeak of ſome of them who had voted the Edition vulgar to be authentick, and yet did except againſt the interpretation of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for ſin pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in the Hiſtory of the Council. p. 207) there is a contradiction noted by the German Divines in the ſixth ſeſſion, the ſeventh ch. Where it is ſaid of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which every one receives according to his meaſure, <hi>quam Spiritus Sanctus partitur ſingulis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut vult, et ſecundum propriam cujuſque diſpoſitionem et cooperationem: Which the Holy Ghoſt doth impart as he will, and according to every ones diſpoſition and cooperation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If according to his will, then not according to our diſpoſition; for then it is not, as he will. And ſo in the thirteenth ſeſſion, in the firſt ch. it is ſaid of the manner of Chriſt's exiſtence in the Sacrament, <hi>quam etſi verbis exprimere vix poſſumus;</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we can ſcarce expreſſe in words, and yet in the fourth ch. it is called of the Holy Catholick Church, Tranſubſtantiation <hi>convenienter et proprie,</hi> appoſitly and properly. And in the ſecond Canon of the ſame ſeſſion, it ſaith of Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>quam quidem converſionem Catholica Eccleſia aptiſſime Tranſubſtantiationem apellat;</hi> which the Catholick Church cals moſt fitly Tranſubſtantiation. Was the Council of Trent infallibly aſſiſted, or aſſiſted with infallibility in theſe contradictions? and yet it may be theſe not all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 9.</note>But number the ninth will make an end of our cauſe, if a <hi>Rodomontado</hi> of my Adverſary could do the deed. Thus, <hi>And when you ask again, why
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:40740:261"/> you are charged as if you were oppoſed to the true Catholick Church? I anſwer, Chriſt had in all ages a true Catholick Church, and conſequently he had ſuch a Church when your Reformation, as you call it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. But at this your Reformation you did oppoſe in very many and important points of Doctrine not onely the Roman, but all other Churches upon earth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without doubt you oppoſed the truly Catholick Church in very many and important points. And in plain Engliſh I tell you, this Argument which is in lawfull form is unanſwerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> So then. But is this <hi>Achilles?</hi> Is this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? Alas, if we come near him, it is but bombaſt. Firſt, we deny it in the lawfulneſſe of the forme, which he aſſerts; for it is concluding in the ſecond figure affirmatively, and in this regard onely it is <hi>unanſwerable:</hi> for it is not to be anſwered, for want of forme. But yet ſecondly, leſt they ſhould think it is unanſwerable in the matter, we anſwer to the <hi>major</hi> firſt, by diſtinguiſhing; if he takes the true Catholick Church, as in the Apoſtles Creed, he commits an equivocation; for ſo it cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>minor;</hi> becauſe we have in the <hi>minor</hi> the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and <hi>other Churches,</hi> now the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is a viſible Church, he means, and ſo he means the <hi>other Churches</hi> to be viſible; for we cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly oppoſe, he will think, any but viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but in the Creed is meant the Church inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is the object of faith. If he takes it for the true Catholick Church viſible, as always perſpicuous and flouriſhing in viſibility in all the parts of it, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that the Church Catholick is ſo viſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deny the <hi>major;</hi> and need not ſay any thing to the <hi>minor;</hi> and yet alſo we deny the <hi>minor,</hi> becauſe, if it were not ſo viſible, we could not be ſaid to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. And he cannot prove that we oppoſed all other
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:40740:262"/> Churches; becauſe they were not in his ſenſe, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore how can he ſay, that we oppoſed all other Churches, ſince, if they were viſible in the parts to ſome that were Neighbors, yet not viſible to the world generally? Was the Church leſſe the Church in the Primitive times, when it wanted can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to be ſeen in the night? or the ſeven thouſand, which <hi>Elijah</hi> did not know of, leſſe belonging to the Church of the Jews, becauſe they did not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe the true Religion? How then can it be ſaid rationally, that we oppoſed all Churches; for how could he or any one man under Heaven know all the Churches of the world then? Yea, thirdly, <hi>in</hi> how <hi>many and important points</hi> did the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers oppoſe the Greek Church; and the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who as the Author of the Hiſtory of the Trent Council ſayes, had forſaken the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then four hundred years before, in his fifth book. Yea, fourthly, the <hi>major</hi> propoſition ſuppoſeth for all times and places: doth it not? for ſo the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is properly taken, as including all times and places: and ſo we deny the <hi>minor:</hi> we did not oppoſe all Churches of all times. <hi>Dato non conceſſo,</hi> that we did at the Reformation op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>not onely the Roman, but all other Churches,</hi> yet did we not oppoſe all Churches, or the Roman of the Primitive times: and therefore did we not oppoſe the Catholick Church. Yea, yet fifthly, we diſtinguiſh diſſent from oppoſition. Although oppoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a difference, yet every difference doth not include an oppoſition, for then St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had oppoſed the Church in differing from it upon the point of Rebaptization. And if it be ſaid that the point of Rebaptization was not then defined by the Church: we ſay, that yet this conſideration doth not make every difference to have in it the nature of
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:40740:262"/> oppoſition; for then, though St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had not oppoſed the authority of a Church in a Council, yet had he oppoſed the authoritie of the Church; which then did bind him more than the Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil doth us. And that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did ſo oppoſe the Church, was not then held by the Church Catholick. Sixthly, to return the Argument upon them. <hi>Chriſt had in all ages a true Catholick Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he had ſuch a Church when</hi> their deformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on went on in the Trent Council, but they then in <hi>very many and important points of Doctrine</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all true Catholicks; <hi>therefore without doubt</hi> they <hi>oppoſed the</hi> truly <hi>Catholick Church in very many and important points;</hi> as in communion under one kind; in Tranſubſtantiation; in Purgatorie; in the merit of works; in ſeven Sacraments of proper name; in invocation and religious worſhip of the Saints; in Images. Yea, the Roman Church hath more formally oppoſed the whole Church; becauſe in the Trent Council it would have the Roman Church to be the Catholick; which ſuppoſeth that all Chriſtians muſt ſtrike ſail to them, or elſe they are ſunke. Seventhly, we tell him wherein the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt hath divided from the whole Church; but he doth not tell us particularly in what points we have divided from all Churches. Indeed it is the ſafeſt way not to come to particulars, for fear of diſcovery. <hi>In generalibus latet tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us come up cloſely to him. Either the Fathers of the Primitive Church are on my Adverſary's ſide in the points of difference, or our's; or have not expreſſed themſelves ſufficiently on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part: but the Fathers of the Primitive times are not on my Adverſary's ſide. For there was none of thoſe points which we have named held by them: and my Adverſary did know that ſome of ours have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:40740:263"/> 
               <hi>Campion's</hi> challenge about the Fathers, with another challenge to the Romaniſts, to ſhew ſo much as one Father, one Doctor in the Primitive times that hath expreſſed himſelf for them in the points of difference. Then if they have expreſſed themſelves, (and if not, we have not oppoſed them) they are on our ſide; becauſe we are upon contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Thus we ſee what is become of his <hi>unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Argument.</hi> We ſee that we can differ from them without oppoſition to the Catholick Church, better than they can differ from us without oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Catholick Church: becauſe we in our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from them have kept the Catholick faith, which they have warped from. And ſo that which is left behind in the number, will never come up to fight us to any purpoſe. For as for the Reformers oppoſing the Church, becauſe they cenſured that which was propoſed by the Papiſts, <hi>as oppoſite to the word of God,</hi> we take our Reformation from Scripture; and alſo we ſay, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in points of difference to conclude, that what is by them urged, <hi>is oppoſite to the word of God.</hi> For it is enough to us to differ upon the negative to the word of God; ſince our principle is, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a ſufficient rule of faith and practiſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though a point propoſed doth not oppoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as not being contradictory; yet we reject it from being any Article of faith, becauſe it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture: And thus, the negative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture doth ſufficiently conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any other article of faith than what is in it.</p>
            <p>And as for our not naming <hi>in this whole age, one age in this laſt thouſand years, wherein Chriſt had a truly Catholick Church, agreeing with you in thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and most important points, wherein your Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:40740:263"/> taxed us to have oppoſed the Scriptures;</hi> This in effect hath been anſwered before; and hath not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing materially new. But firſt, this is always an unreaſonable demand; which goes upon a certain preſumption of the Romaniſt, that the true Church muſt be alwaies conſpicuouſly viſible; which is to be denied, and therefore it doth not follow, that becauſe we cannot name any Church agreeing with us, therefore there was none. Secondly, if he means by a truly Catholick Church, one particular Church of the Catholick, thoſe whom we have named did not agree with them in the moſt important points of difference, (as not in point of Diſcipline) nay, they have differed from them, and therefore have agreed with us in the queſtions betwixt us. And beſides, if they meane a truely Catholick Church in this ſenſe, as a part of the whole; then a particular Church it ſeems may be a Catholick, and a truely Catholick Church: and therefore have they no reaſon to vaunt of the title of Catholick given by the Antients to the Church or Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe other Churches may alſo be Catholick: and why then ſhould the Pope uſurp the title of univerſall Biſhop over a particular Church? And if he means by <hi>a truely Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> the Catholick Church properly, then he doth imply a contradiction, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, which includes all ages, ſhould be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a thouſand yeares. But thirdly, he did wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtint the queſtion for this thouſand yeares, ſince he could not well go further, for the ſix hundred years before do ſhew no diſagreement to us in the moſt important points of difference. And let them aſſure themſelves, that our agreement with the ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Primitive Church is more available for our defence, than the ſuppoſed diſagreement with the thouſand years after is available to the accuſation.
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:40740:264"/> Fourthly, ſuppoſe no one Church could be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med correſponding with us in moſt important points, for this thouſand yeares; yet even in every age of the thouſand yeares there might be (and ſome have) named ſeverall perſons which have held the materiall points of difference betwixt us; and ſeverall of the Roman Communion have bore teſtimony to the truth; yea, even in the Trent Council; in ſo much that they have been complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of for bending to Proteſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntiſme; as may be ſeen through the Hiſtory of that Council. Fifthly, what Tyranny is this, to ſtifle and ſmother by their domination all other Churches, as much as they could, which were not of their faith, and then challenge us to ſhew what Church agreed with us? Sixthly, <hi>Omne reducitur ad principium,</hi> as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas's</hi> rule is, then we are to take a true Church from trial of Scripture: and we put it to this iſſue; All Catholick Churches agree with Scripture in the moſt important points of difference: we agree with Scripture, or Scripture with us in theſe points; therefore we agree with all Catholick Churches in theſe points; becauſe we agree <hi>in tertio.</hi> Therefore if the Romaniſts differ, let them look to it. We dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from none but them in thoſe points: and that we differ from them is their fault, and our ſecurity. If they had not left the Catholick, to be a ſingular Plenipotentiarie; we had not left Communion with them as a part of the whole; or rather they had not left our Communion. <hi>Delictum ambulat cum Capite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for that he ſays, <hi>And as for externall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, you cannot name the Church upon earth from which you did not divide your ſelves at your Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> We return it with the neceſſary changes; nor can they at their Deformation <hi>name the Church upon earth from which</hi> they <hi>did not divide themſelves.
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:40740:264"/> And I challenge them to tell me, if</hi> they <hi>can, to what Church on earth then viſible</hi> they <hi>did joine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or who acknowledged to be of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt, as for external Communion, we ſay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, firſt, we divided not firſt Communion, but the Pope, when, in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he ſent a Bill to prohibit his Subjects Communion with us. 2. We divided not from their Church ſimply, but ſo as corrupted and engaging us, upon communion with them to error and bad practiſe. We left the houſe as infected, with a mind of returning when it ſhall be clear and ſafe for us. Thirdly as before, we divided not from the Primitive times in point of Doctrine or Diſcipline: now then, ſuppoſe there was not at the Reformation any other Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we might joine; which is more agreable to the duty and honor of a Church, to joine with a corrupt Church in Doctrine and practiſe, or to leave their communion externall and to follow the Primitive? If the perſon be to be eſteemed by the Doctrine, not the Doctrine by the perſon, as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian's</hi> rule is in his <hi>Praeſcrip.</hi> Then we may leave fellowſhip of perſons for affinity with better Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if by the communion with the perſons, we muſt alſo eſpouſe the errours. Fourthly, as they have ſunke their Patriarcate, and have arrogated an univerſallity of domination (and ſo have divided from all the world, that they might reigne over all) ſo we have reſumed our antient libertie of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Church to ſubſiſt independently from them. Yea, this was acknowledged in effect by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> when he called for <hi>Anſelme</hi> in the Council at a plunge, <hi>Includamus hunc in orbe noſtro tanquam al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius orbis Papam.</hi> And therefore, as to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon ſubjections we are not bound; and as to
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:40740:265"/> fraternall Communion we are ready in mind, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are, or when they ſhall be found; ſince all the ſeparation which was made by us, (if any made) was in our own defence. Fifthly, if <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> were able to judge, many would have been of our Communion, durſt they have been like thoſe whom St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of, who were unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; becauſe they did not fear to die. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaid of <hi>Plato,</hi> that he would as plainly have ſpoken for one God as <hi>Socrates,</hi> but that he was afraid of <hi>Socrates's</hi> death; ſo that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured his paſſages of Divinity, with other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which did differ: ſo would many (beſides thoſe in the Trent Council) have ſpoken more freely for the Proteſtants, but for the Inquiſition: and this hath made them blende good paſſages for us with ſome appearances againſt us. So then ſince we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the firſt four Generall Councils in Doctrine, and with the Primitive times alſo in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, this <hi>externall diviſion</hi> from you makes the quarrell; but as the caſe ſtood, no guilt; and therefore no danger. The Catholick Church hath the greateſt promiſes; the Roman Church is not the Catholick Church. So then we may do well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Communion, if we pray for them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 10.</note>In the tenth number, he would winde himſelf off from the inconveniency of his own principle in the fourth page of the Treatiſe, <hi>True it is to ſubmit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly to temporall judges, they being able, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to judge of the exteriour man; but God who ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the reins and the heart, and who looketh moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind (which is the ſeate of true or falſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief) doth chiefly exact that thoſe of his Church be of one faith interiourly, or elſe they are not of one faith: for faith eſſentially conſiſteth in the interiour judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which words I did argue thus: <hi>We
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:40740:265"/> are bound to ſubmit our judgement onely to thoſe who can judge of the inward act. But God onely can judge our internall acts; therefore we muſt ſubmit our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents onely to him; and therefore to others no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they ſpeake according to him: ſo that we cannot abſolutely adhere to whatſoever is ſaid in Councils, which have erred, Jewiſh and Chriſtian too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now he ſaies, <hi>I never ſaid any ſuch thing.</hi> He means, namely, that Councils cannot judge of the interiour act. Nor do I ſay, that he did ſay ſo. But I took his principle, <hi>That God onely ſearcheth the heart and reins, and looketh upon the mind, and exacteth that thoſe of his Church be of one judgement interiourly,</hi> for my diſcourſe. The Argument is out of its own poſition. And now, (if there had been need of his confeſſion) he hath acknowledged the Aſſumption, that God onely can judge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall act: for he denies this ability to Councils. And therefore it doth appear, that he is ſnarled: and that Councils cannot binde the internall act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot judge thereof.</p>
            <p>But now therefore he would evade thus. <hi>But God (in whoſe name the Church teacheth and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all which ſhe teacheth and commandeth) ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the heart and the reins.</hi> What then? Becauſe they teach and command in God's name, therefore have they God's omniſcience? If the Divine nature of Chriſt did not transfuſe by communication of Ideoms a reall propertie to the humane nature, of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; ſhall they thinke to makes God's Court, which immediately obligeth in Conſcience, to be theirs? They make God and the Council all one. As they have given to the Pope Chriſt's Chaire: ſo they will give to the Council God's Tribunall. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is taught in Gods name hath not always for it,
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:40740:266"/> 
               <hi>ſic dicit Dominus,</hi> God's word pierceth the heart, as before, but every thing which is taught under God's name is not according to his word, as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. This is juſt ſuch an Argument as that of the Pontificians to prove, that the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſee all things, becauſe they ſee him who ſees all things: Yes, and he that ſearcheth the hearts giveth them his authority, therefore they can binde in the intetiour act. Hath he given them this authority? Hath he given them this power? if they affirme it, it is high Blaſphemy. If they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, the Argument of my Adverſary to excuſe himſelf, is a nullitie. And my Argument is yet good againſt them, ſince his is no better than if I ſhould ſay, becauſe they ſee one who ſees nothing, they ſee nothing. And therefore this did fully abſolve the ſubſtance of the fourth page, or diſſolve it; the Council may be aſſiſted and yet not with omniſcience, nor infallibility.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 11.</note>And therefore hath he no cauſe to ſay to me, <hi>but you skip to my admiration of your Doctrine.</hi> Let the judicious Reader judge which have ſkipped moſt; he that anſwereth punctually, or he that gives a treatiſe for an anſwer. I urged him preſſely; and he anſwered me not ſo much as <hi>coldly,</hi> not at all. This was one ſkip for all.</p>
            <p>And then he goes on with repetitions of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of his refutations of it before with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to the fourth chap. And then he tels me what ſhall be done in the next. But I ſhould not hear of it untill it be done. <hi>Laudari non poteſt niſi peractum,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. this might have been ſkipped.</p>
            <p>Then he comes to ſay ſomewhat of St. <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. As for St. Athanaſius, did ever he oppoſe his judgement againſt the definitions ef a lawfull Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:40740:266"/> Councill? Nay, did it not appeare by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Nice, ſtanding for his Doctrine, that he might well know, the true Church, lawfully aſſembled under the lawfull Paſtor, confirming their acts, would teach as he did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, the whole argument is drawn but <hi>a ſingulari,</hi> and this will not conclude, if he did not oppoſe. Secondly, if it did conclude, it would not be contradictory; for we do not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain oppoſition. Thirdly, though he did not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Synod of Nice, yet doth it not follow preſently, that he did not oppoſe it by reaſon of an infallibility, but becauſe it was not deceived, as ruling it ſelf by the word of God. Fourthly, St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had the ſame opinion againſt the multitude, which the Nicene Council had, before the Council or after. If before alſo, then we ſee that one man is not to be controlled by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and therefore why are we upbraided in our Religion with the paucity of the Profeſſors? If after, then we ſee that a Council is not an effectuall meanes to put an end to all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. Fifthly, he doth not adviſedly put in theſe words, <hi>the lawfull Paſtor confirming their Acts.</hi> This is not diſcreetly applied to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Nice; for, as to this, he was firſt deceived, in thinking we would ſwallow his ſuppoſition of <hi>the lawfull Paſtor</hi> in his ſenſe of univerſality and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. We deny the Pope to be the lawfull Paſtor. Secondly, <hi>Liberius</hi> did ſubſcribe S. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius's</hi> baniſhment: and how ſhall we then take the confirmation of a Council from a Pope, when he ſubſcribes againſt it? Thirdly, the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was not confirmed by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> more than by ſome other Biſhop. Yea, as it was called By the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſo was it confirmed
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:40740:267"/> by him. And therefore by my Aduerſaries princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, The authority of the Nicene Council ſhould be but humane, becauſe it had not its <hi>eſſe forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> by the Pope. Yea, ſixthly, neither is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that after the Nicene Council he ſhould <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a greater humane authority</hi> upon the authority of the Council, as if it had been more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: for he oppoſed the greater part before. Seventhly, he did not well conſider what he ſaid; for if he might oppoſe (upon his ſuppoſition) a greater humane authority; then, untill they prove the authority of a Council to be Divine, ſo as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſiſted with infallibility, there may be a greater authority than of the Nicene Council; which is not true notwithſtanding. And if he meant ſo, he opppſed a Generall Council more than I.</p>
            <p>In the following words of this number, I was glad to finde him ſo ſoberly defending the title of Roman Catholicks. He ſaies, <hi>To avoid this very ſtrife, impertinent now to our purpoſe, I uſed that very name by which no others are excluded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ingeniouſly ſaid, but he knew that the Romaniſts are wont to uſurp this title. And I had good reaſon to take good notice of it, leſt my ſilence ſhould be miſ-interpreted. For ſome are wont to take advantage at what is ſaid, and alſo at what is not ſaid. But indeed doth he give up the title to the uſe of others alſo as not excluſive to them, neither in comprehenſion, (which would make a contradiction) nor in juriſdiction; then why doe men contend ſo much for the Roman Church, as Mother and Miſtriſſe of all Churches? Why is added in their Creed to the Catholick Church the Roman? Why in the Trent Council was none accounted Catholicks but them? Indeed
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:40740:267"/> alſo this is the wiſeſt courſe, if the knot cannot be untied, to cut it off: ſo he, to avoide the proof of the appropriation of the title to them, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the appropriation. But this confeſſion I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Prieſts of <hi>Rome</hi> would not well accept; for in very deed it goes near to the ruining of the cauſe. And this plainly contradicts himſelf in his own principles, thus; the Catholick Church is infallible: ſo he ſays ſtill. The Roman Church is onely infallible. So he ſaid in the end of the former Treatiſe; then the Roman Church is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholick. Now he ſays he did not exclude other Churches: and yet no Church Catholick but the Roman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in this impertinent ſtrife you ſay many things, of which you prove not one.</hi> If ſuch a put-off might be allowed to me, I might ſoon have done. I need not ſay much to what is ſaid, becauſe ſo little is ſaid to any purpoſe. But he knew he was pinched by mention of the falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nicene Council about the ſuperiority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeverall other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which needed no proof to an intelligent man, let the world judge, whether if any thing could be excepted againſt what I ſaid ſolidly, my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary would have forborne the offering of it to conſideration. And alſo to my former vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Doctrine about the authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which had four anſwers, he replies nothing but that of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which might more happily have been left out.</p>
            <p>In the twelfth number he would refute me by noting a <hi>dangerous conſequence flowing from the premiſſes of our Doctrine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 12.</note> his diſcourſe is reſolved into this Syllogiſme, <hi>Texts of Scripture</hi> are not
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:40740:268"/> 
               <hi>able to decide all neceſſary controverſies (unleſſe as they ſend us to the Church) by themſelves, as I ſhall ſhew in my next ch.</hi> But I hold texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely infallible. Therefore we ſhall never have an end of Controverſies, unleſſe we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the texts of Scripture (which ſpeake of Chriſt's promiſes to the Church) of aſſiſtance infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: as St. <hi>Math.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> and others which we ſhall have an account of in the next ch. This is the ſum of his ratiocination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We ſhall ſhew the civility not to prevent the uſe and buſineſſe of the next ch. but this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning will be valid no where; it will not grow ſtronger by the next age. Therefore we ſay (not to repeat repetitions) that, as to the <hi>major</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, we deny it upon our account of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Controverſies, although not upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. All things plainly neceſſary are ſo laid down in Scripture, as there needs be no controverſie thereabouts. In things of queſtion ſimple error doth not damn. But thoſe who make no difference of belief by reſpect to object or uſe, but do take all upon the propoſall of the Church, are apt to enlarge the number of things neceſſary, becauſe, all upon that account are with equall neceſſity to be received. And yet, as hath been noted, they have no reaſon to multiply the number of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Controverſies; for with them there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of believing any thing but this, that the Church is infallible. But then ſecondly, as to the <hi>major,</hi> if he meane <hi>by themſelves</hi> ſo as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould formally decide Controverſies, he fights with his own ſhadow: for it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, when we do not affirme: we ſay not that formally any Controverſie is decided by texts of Scripture, but that in things plain there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:40740:268"/> of any ſuch deciſion; and in many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies the Scripture doth as well in the principles decide it, as the Law doth differences civil. If he meanes <hi>by themſelves</hi> therefore ſo, as that they do not decide them without ſending us <hi>to the Church;</hi> we anſwer by diſtinguiſhing, that firſt in things plaine there is no need of the judgement of the Church. In things of Controverſie there is need of the Church; but not need of infallible determination. There is an ending of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſpeculatively, when the judgement is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by infallible Scripture: there is an ending of Controverſies practically, by authority of the Church, ſo as to binde the perſon againſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. Now the queſtion betwixt us is of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ending of Controverſies which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Church. And dare any man that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly reads all the Hiſtory of the Councill of Trent, and obſerveth ſo long deliberations, ſo many interpoſals, ſo hot diſputes, ſuch changes, ſo many notable Contradictions of many of them, ſay, that all Controverſies were there infallibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? As <hi>Tertullian</hi> to the Heathens, <hi>appello Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiam veſtram;</hi> I appeale unto their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences when they are preparing for death, whether Cardinall, or Canoniſt, or Pope dare affirme it. This for the <hi>major.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the aſſumption, I alſo may diſtinguiſh, if he takes texts of Scripture as principles in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Concluſions, I hold them onely infallible. If he takes texts of Scripture, as in terms, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to Concluſions immediate, ſo I do not hold them onely infallible, but alſo the Concluſions which do naturally deſcend by prime reſultance from them. Now a Council may apply principles of Scripture which may reſolve a queſtion unto
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:40740:269"/> faith; but this is not done always and abſolutely: and when it is done, it is done by vertue of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They do not determine things by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, but by humane diſquiſition, as was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the Trent Council; and therefore may they miſſe poſſibly in their diſcourſe. Yea, to the aſſumption I alſo ſay, though I hold texts of Scripture onely infallible; yet I onely do not hold them ſo; but the Fathers, as before; the Nicene Doctors, as before; yea, and ſome in the Trent Councill too, as we have noted. And again, if any thing elſe be infallible, then a Council; if a Council, then according to them, the Council of Trent; if the Council of Trent, why did they not determine of Biſhops whether they were <hi>jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino</hi> or not? and why did they not determine of Reſidence, whether <hi>jure Divino</hi> or not? If they could not, how were they infallible? If they would not, how were they faithfull? Again, If you be <hi>neceſſitated,</hi> as you ſay, to extend the texts of Chriſts aſſiſtance to his Church unto infallibility, for the ending of controverſies, otherwiſe <hi>we ſhall remaine diſputing without end, or poſſibility of end,</hi> and onely for this, as he ſeems to meane, then there is no neceſſity at all. And the conſequence is cleare (without his <hi>abſurdity</hi>) upon the former diſtinction; becauſe plain things need not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion; and points of queſtion need not an infallible deciſion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 13.</note>In the thirteenth number I have two things chiefly to conſider; firſt, his charge of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in my declaring the difficulty of aſſent by the unanimous conſent <hi>of all the Fathers of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges every where.</hi> Secondly, I am to conſider his Apology for waving the authority of the Fathers in this debate. He asks me as to the firſt <hi>What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:40740:269"/> hath the peruſall of every judgment of every Father of every age every where with that obligation which I put of following theſe Canons of Councils, which make to the deciſion of thoſe moſt known Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies about which we contend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, there is a connexion of this diſcourſe with the ground of that about which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, namely, the authority of the Church. For what authority can they produce for the diſtinction of the Church from no Church in any profeſſion, or from a falſe Church, but the unanimous conſent of the Fathers of the Church? What Council did make themſelves by their own authority to be indeed Chriſtians? the firſt Councils were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to Chriſtianity, but Chriſtianity to them. So then either the Church is diſtinguiſhed by the conſent of the Fathers, or by Scripture. If by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then is it the firſt principle and the laſt: and <hi>a primo ad ultimum,</hi> we have no more dependence upon the Church than from Scripture. If by the conſent of the Fathers, then I ſpake before to good purpoſe, though my Adverſary ſaid, it <hi>was nothing to our purpoſe.</hi> For the Councils we muſt be ruled by abſolutely, as he ſuppoſeth, are the Councils of the Church, are they not? well then, if the Church be diſtinguiſhed by the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, (which I ſuppoſe they will not deny) then the diſcourſe about the conſent of the Fathers was not eccentricall to the point in hand. Let them remember the rule of Aquinas, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne reducitur ad principium.</hi> Secondly, it beares connexion with the queſtion about Councils <hi>per modum regulae,</hi> as the rule by which they goe in their definitions. Either they went by Scripture, or by the conſent of the Fathers. If they went by Scripture, then by my Adverſaries opinion we
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:40740:270"/> muſt goe that way: becauſe we are to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly directed by them. If by the joint conſent of the Fathers, then ſurely our diſcourſe was very proper and pertinent: or if they will not have the Fathers conſent to be conſidered ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed unto Scripture (becauſe as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates and Preſidents of the Trent Council ſaid, <hi>the holy Fathers have no other grounds but Scripture</hi>) yet the conſent of the Fathers is diſtinguiſhed from the object upon which their conſent is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. So then, as for the ſenſe of Scripture, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Councils went by the rule of the Father's joint interpretation or not: if by it, then we have our purpoſe of defending the reaſonableneſſe of our ſpeech about the Fathers. If not, then by the common rules of underſtanding the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then why ſhould we not goe that way for our reſolution which they go.</p>
            <p>So that my Adverſary needed not to have given me an admonition of <hi>holding cloſe to the matter.</hi> And yet I take that admonition very kindely, that my Adverſaries might be obedient to their own law.</p>
            <p>That which he ſaies, <hi>Is the judgement of every Father of every age the judgement of a Generall Council?</hi> is nothing. For though it be not the judgement of the Councill <hi>in recto;</hi> yet I hope, it was <hi>in cauſa;</hi> not that they were determined by the judgement of one ſeparately from the reſt, but becauſe it is ſuppoſed by my Adverſaries, that they all agreed. If they ſay they did not, then let my Adverſaries agree it as well as they can with the reſt of their Church, who ſtand as much for our obedience to them, as to any other authority of the Church. And whether they hold the Fathers as Judges or as witneſſes, it is all one to me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:40740:270"/> I ſpeak of their authority in general. So then, if the judgement of every Father of every age disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively or diſtributively be not the judgement of a general Council (which my Antagoniſts think unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable) yet conjunctively and complexively, I hope it is, or ſhould be, according to their common principles. And if they lie at catch upon the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of the termes <hi>of every Father of every age,</hi> they commit a plain fallacy, in diſtribution and alſo are peccant in the ignorance of the <hi>Elench,</hi> for if they meane every Father of every age diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively, it doth not contradict me who ſpeake of them in conſent.</p>
            <p>And now ſhall I come to the ſecond taske, to hunt out the reaſon why he would not deale with me in this Controverſie by the authority of the Fathers. He ſaies thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since you bring the authority of Councils to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than nothing, and again the authority of the Fathers to a little leſſe than nothing; in order to the ending of Controverſies, this your violence againſt any provocation to antiquity and conſent to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will give me leave to make this Treatiſe much ſhorter than at the begining appeared poſſible; for it is evident out of your own words, that it is to no end to deale with you out of Fathers: and I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deale with no body but to ſome end. I will therefore humor you in this: and I will lay aſide all that might hereafter be ſaid concerning the opinion of Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Nimia perfectio parit ſuſpicionem.</hi> My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is ſo curious in this apology of his, that he is to be ſuſpected. I gave no ſuch occaſion, but he takes it againſt the uſe of the Fathers in this point. I am not guilty, in any ſober mans judgement, of any privative diſrepect unto them. I do not bring
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:40740:271"/> 
               <hi>the authority of the Fathers to a little leſſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> what is due juſtly either to Councils or to Fathers I do willingly give. But becauſe infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not granted, therefore am I charged with diſreſpect. This is a fallacie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them this doth not deny unto them ſuch reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as is equal. And for the Fathers, I have not waved any teſtimony which hath been produced againſt our cauſe; I have not ſaid, as he,
<q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</q> Yea, I have uſed the ſame Argument againſt my Adverſaries <hi>in triumphum.</hi> Again, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as he in his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick: but I have ſaid nothing which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the word of God, to the conſent of the Fathers and of the Doctors of the Church: but becauſe I will not make the word of the Fathers and of the Doctors equall to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible word of God, therefore am I not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accuſed of ſlighting the Fathers and Doctors of the antient Church. But this was neceſſary for my Adverſary, to colour his refuſall of anſwering to thoſe Fathers I brought againſt him, and to the anſwers which I gave to the teſtimonies of the Fathers which he brought againſt me. So difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſometimes by Sophiſters conſtrued for imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency. By this Argument I muſt ſay nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per but what may be eaſily anſwered. But it had been more ingenuous, firſt, to have exhibited ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid authorities out of the Fathers of the Primitive antiquity; or at leaſt to have given a ſufficient anſwer to my refutation of what uſe he made of thoſe he quoted againſt me; and then to have laid aſide the urging of the Fathers upon my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Refuſall of them onely as infallible Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. To gather up then my exceptions againſt this part of his apologie; I ſay firſt, I do not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:40740:271"/> in terms, or by conſequence, bring <hi>Councils to a little more than nothing, nor the authority of the Fathers to little leſſe than nothing, in order to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Controverſies.</hi> I allow them to be of great uſe in his terms, <hi>in order</hi> to the ending of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. There may be an ordinability of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or in order, to this end, without infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them: they may finde out and give us the infallible ſenſe of Scripture; but we cannot take it ſo upon their word: their authority is moving but not cogent of our aſſent. Secondly, I except againſt thoſe words wherein he imputes to me a <hi>violence againſt any provocation to antiquity and conſent to Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I deny. Neither in termes nor by diſcourſe can they finde ſuch words or ſenſe from me. I have uſed their own weapon againſt them. I have anſwered their objections from them. I renew the provocation and challenge which Biſhop <hi>Jewell</hi> and others of our Divines have made to them, to ſhew, if they can, any notable part, yea, any two, yea, any one of the ancient Fathers that clearly and conſtantly hath profeſſed the points wherein we differ from them. And if the Fathers had been for them, why did they corrupt ſome paſſages of the Fathers which ſpoke againſt them; which they have not yet cleared themſelves of? Yea, thirdly, whereas he ſays <hi>my</hi> refuſall of the Fathers <hi>will give him leave to make this Treatiſe much ſhorter than at the beginning;</hi> I ſay (not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting here upon the impropriety of a Treatiſe, if it be no more as to my ſatisfaction: or of the terme, if it be more) that there had been rome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all the Fathers authorities he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for himſelf, and alſo for all that he could ſay to my anſwers about their teſtimonies, without There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:40740:272"/> his Treatiſe ſo long, if he had left out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences, and references, and repetitions.</p>
            <p>Therefore hath my Adverſary taken more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than I afforded him in his refuſall of dealing with the Fathers: yet not more liberty than was neceſſary for him, leſt he ſhould be in neceſſity to anſwer what anſwers I made to his former teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of them; and alſo to what teſtimonies I have produced againſt him.</p>
            <p>And I finde him wary leſt I ſhould make this advantage of his reſolution to wave the Fathers. He would make it to be no deſign but a rationall purpoſe, therefore he goes on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But doe not think that I doe this, as if what you here ſaid againſt the authority of the Fathers found any credit with me, or as if what you ſay were in the leaſt degree hard to be anſwered, for you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot be ignorant that we alleadge plenty of the Fathers againſt you, as are confeſſed by your ſelves to have been the prime Doctors of the Primitive Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The rule is good, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is not damned that doth not believe, that all which is ſaid by men on their own behalf is true. But ſecondly, they do not produce many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>the prime Doctors of the Primitive Church;</hi> namely, not of the firſt 300 years; nay, nor of the firſt 600 years: others are Poſtnates and have not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Primitive Antiquity: Yea, ſome they name as teſtimonies for them were not Fathers. And ſome works they cite for them which are falſely aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to true Fathers, as ſeveral of our Writers have demonſtrated, even with the Confeſſion of ſome of their Church. Thirdly, whereas he ſaies <hi>[Do not think that I do this as if what you have ſaid againſt the authority of the Fathers found any credit with me]</hi>
               <pb n="629" facs="tcp:40740:272"/> he wrongs me with a fallacie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if he would have men believe that I ſpake againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Fathers ſimply, becauſe I ſpake againſt their authority as abſolutely convictive of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in point of truth. And alſo, whereas he ſaies it did not find credit with him, I am of his opinion: for certainly little is like to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Pontificians that is againſt them. But after this manner his Treatiſe might ſoon be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; it finds not credit with me. One blot would ſerve for all the Treatiſe. Fourthly, what reaſon may this be called, the Pontificians uſe plenty of the Fathers againſt us; therefore he will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my teſtimonies from them, nor to my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to his teſtimonies againſt us. Doe any of thoſe Pontificians fully anſwer my teſtimonies, and doe they ſufficiently take off my anſwers? If they doe, he ſhould have told me which, and where. But were I as apt to brag as the Romans are I might not be far from crying <hi>victoria,</hi> that I ſhould ſtand to anſwer the Fathers and bring them to ſtand for us (though my Adverſary ſaies, I <hi>bring them to leſſe than nothing</hi>) and yet he that makes ſo much of them in ſhew, ſhould detrect this way of plea by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas their ſmall errors uſed preſently to be diſcovered and cryed down.</hi> This is not altogether true. For how many of their errors continued long: yea, great errors alſo, as the Millenarie opinion? And Infant Communion was not preſently decreed neither. Therefore yet it remaines to be proved, that any of the points of difference betwixt the Papiſts and us was a ſtanding opinion of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, which my Adverſary would inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it would make a learned man amazed to ask
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:40740:273"/> as you do, how few of them have touched upon our differences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no ſuch cauſe of Amazement. Learned men in generall wonder leſſe, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men cannot wonder particularly at this, as knowing the reaſon, which was added by me, <hi>having not occaſion by Adverſaries:</hi> and therefore doth my Adverſary wiſely paſſe by any mention of the reaſon, as not being pertinent for his uſe. But alſo was that I ſaid well guarded, firſt, <hi>how few,</hi> I did not ſay none. Secondly, I ſaid tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, namely, as to handle, and this is neceſſary to be believed; becauſe indeed there were few of them Argumentative: then though ſome of them might put out occaſionally ſome expreſſions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our differences, yet is not this to touch argumentatively our differences; for, <hi>aliud agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis parva autoritas,</hi> as the rule is. And then third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if many of them at leaſt did not touch, ſo as to handle diſcurſively all our differences, there is no cauſe of admiring my ſpeech; for if they had han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled ſome, not all, how ſhould we have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in thoſe which they had not handled? Now then let all be conſidered; then upon the whole matter let me ſay this, that if any Pontifician can prove, that many of them did handle argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively all the points of debate betwixt us, then I ſhall give leave for the amazement of my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Therefore as to the Authors he produceth of his ſide, who give account of the Fathers in our diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as <hi>Coccius, Gualterus,</hi> the Author of the Progeny of the Catholicks and Proteſtants, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other named by any other; I ſay this, that he ſhould have told me particulary where each of them doth produce any Father and in what point,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:40740:273"/> and alſo ſhould have ſhewed in them, that many Fathers have all conjunctively ſpoken of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points; and alſo that they have ſpoken of them directly on purpoſe where the ſeat of the matter was; and alſo, that no where they contradict what in one place they ſaid, or at leaſt, did not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſpeak doubtingly: otherwiſe he concludes not any thing of weight againſt me. And then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I can returne my Adverſary number for number and weight for weight of our own, who have anſwered all the teſtimonies of the Fathers, which their learned Champions have produced, as Biſhop <hi>Jewell,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Chamier</hi> of <hi>France</hi>) who have refuted the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Fathers. Yea, the challenge of the firſt of them was never yet well anſwered as to the teſtimony of the Fathers. And thirdly, either the Fathers cannot be brought in with their ſuffrages for them, or they can: if they cannot, why doth <hi>Campian</hi> and others crack and brag of the Fathers? and then alſo my Adverſaries Authors are diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled. If they can, then either the Fathers ſpeak contradictions, ſince we produce them as well for us, (and therefore cannot we be ruled by them) or elſe my Adverſary needed not to have ſhifted the anſwering to them, but might have found o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages out of them to have commodiouſly reconciled the ſeeming variance. Yea, then either my Adverſary had not ſuch cauſe to reſt infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a Council, if all the Fathers of all ages agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or the conſent of the Fathers might be a rule to the Council; and then my diſcourſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had good conjunction with the Controverſie about Councils.</p>
            <p>As for the Author of the Progeny of Catholicks and Proteſtants, whom he brings in here, as <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:40740:274"/> a part all our main differences, and doth in all theſe points give</hi> us <hi>the very words of</hi> our <hi>own chief Doctors clearly acknowledging a great number of holy Fathers directly oppoſit to</hi> us <hi>in each one of theſe points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that it is poſſible ſome of our Church may not meet with right editions of the Fathers; might not diſcerne their true works; might miſtake the ſenſe and application of ſome words, or not being able dexterouſly to reconcile their expreſſions to ſome other paſſages of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and to our opinions, might conclude them as oppoſit. If this Argument were good, then are they alſo bound to conclude the Fathers to be on our ſide, becauſe <hi>Bellarmin</hi> produceth in his Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions teſtimonies of the Fathers for us. Indeed he endeavours to anſwer thoſe teſtimonies: but I dare affirme, that ſeverall of thoſe teſtimonies which the Author hath produced from our own ſide of the Fathers, may as well be anſwered as ſome of thoſe which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers. Thirdly, my Adverſaries might have known alſo, that there is a book written by none of ours which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of Papiſts by Papiſts: So then, if they will ſet our Divines againſt us, we can ſet their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines againſt them; yea, alſo in ſeverall points were the teſtimonies of the Primitive Church ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt ſome of their points in the Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil by ſome of their Church. Fourthly, I have read <hi>Breerley</hi> through (it being commended to me by one who thought, I think, thereby to convince me in the caſe) and I can give no other account than as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> doth, that he hath not dealt exactly with the Confeſſions of thoſe of our Church, as in the inſtance of ſome paſſages out of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> as may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
               <pb n="633" facs="tcp:40740:274"/> page 62. As alſo in a paſſage of <hi>Luther,</hi> as may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Chilling.</hi> If the pages 79 and 92 be compared. And therefore have we no reaſon to be concluded againſt upon his word; yea, ſome of the authorities he bringeth do not reſpect the main points betwixt us: and as I remember, ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities are not contradictory to our cauſe, and therefore was I rather confirmed by reading of that book. And therefore <hi>groundleſſe</hi> is my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries excuſe for not medling with the holy Fathers in this Controverſie betwixt us. Though they did not profeſſedly diſcuſſe and determine our queſtions (and therefore cannot their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo much ſway us) yet their expreſſions for us might weigh with our Adverſaries; who ſo much boaſt of them at leaſt, they might ſay ſomewhat to what anſwers have been made to their quotations of them. And if we muſt not make uſe of them, becauſe we cannot account them infallible, then my Adverſaries diſcourſe might have been alſo well ſpared, for I am ſure his diſcourſe is not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>He having then diſmiſſed the hearing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>ſine die;</hi> he comes upon us thus. <hi>And indeed your Doctors would faine diſpute out of Scripture onely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If <hi>onely</hi> be taken in order to the ultimate reſolution of faith, we would indeed diſpute out of Scripture onely; becauſe the Principles of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are onely to us infallible, but if <hi>onely</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken excluſively to all uſe of the Fathers, we deny it. To ſhew that our Doctrine is truely Divine, we prove it out of Scripture: to ſhew that it is not new, we compare it with the ſayings of the Fathers; yea, the judgement of the Fathers hath it ſelf to faith as a rationall diſpoſitive; but not as an iner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:40740:275"/> determinative, this Priviledge we reſerve to Scripture, which is to us the formall object and ground of Divine faith. And if they can ſhew us <hi>ſic dicit Dominus,</hi> for abſolute credence to the Church, we have done.</p>
            <p>But he gives us his <hi>Criſis</hi> why we would faine diſpute out of Scripture onely. <hi>Becauſe they find it to be true, that the Scriptures alone cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide many Controverſies but by ſome Interpretation or other, they think themſelves able to elude the force of Arguments drawn from Scripture onely: the ſayings which are not in Scripture are in no caſe receivable by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Well gueſſed. Surely we have here a meer Cavill by a <hi>non cauſa:</hi> doe not our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries think that they are as cunning at interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we? They are wont to brag of the brave Education and Learning: therefore likely they can tell how to elude an Interpretation as well as others, and there were thoſe that told them they did do ſo in the Trent Council.—<hi>Catilina, Cethegum.</hi> And would not our Adverſaries have all the diſpute referred to the Church which they can order as they pleaſe as a Leſbian rule, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupting the ſtile or adultering the ſenſe, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid of the Hereticks then, or prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting Authors againſt them to be read? Yea, what debates were there about the ſenſe of the Decrees of the Council of Trent? Yea, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees were purpoſely put into ſuch termes of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie, that ſo the mind of the Council might be drawn into different ſenſes according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Litigants, as the Author of the Hiſtory relates. Secondly, herein then appears our ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, in that we diſpute with you by that which is capable of other ſenſes: whereas they would have
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:40740:275"/> us to be referred to the ſenſe of the Church, which they think cannot be accommodated for us. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we do not ſay, that <hi>no ſaying is receivable in any caſe by us but out of Scripture,</hi> but receivable equally upon neceſſity to ſalvation we ſtill deny e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſaying: we receive ſufficiently what is ſaid by the Church in point of Diſcipline: and what is ſaid in point of faith we receive with due reverence; not with abſolute faith.</p>
            <p>And certainly we ſeem to give more reſpect to the Church than they do to Scripture, if all of them be like my Adverſary; for ſo he goes on. <hi>Whereas indeed there is no good got by diſputing of texts of Scripture, but either to make men ſick or mad, as our Adverſaries may daily ſee by their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Scripture-Combates with the Anabaptiſts, the Sabbatharians, and other upſtart Sectaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Omne mendacium, quod de Deo dicunt, quodammodo genus eſt Idololatriae,</hi> as he ſaid in his Preſcriptions: and this which is falſely ſaid of the word of God, is for the Idoll of the Roman Church. The Scripture hath it ſelf to the Church as the Emperor to the Pope in the Roman account: and as the Moon hath it ſelf to the Sun, ſo hath the Emperor himſelf to the Pope; the Moon depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sun for light, the Emperor upon the Pope for authority; and the Scripture upon the Church for light and authority. But firſt, he argues from the deniall of the act to the deniall of the power; yea, from the deniall of the effect to the deniall of the power; becauſe there is no <hi>good got by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of texts of Scripture,</hi> therefore, but our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Scripture doth not follow from the effect, but from the inſtitution. Secondly, as for thoſe points which are neceſſary there needs be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting upon the texts. Thirdly, the unſucceſſe
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:40740:276"/> follows from the perverſneſſe of thoſe who will <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and have more mind to victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than verity. Fourthly, why had they then in the Trent Council the Bible in the midſt of them? Why did the Divines urge Scripture? Yea, why did the Nicene Fathers determine the conſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Son by Scripture? Yea, why did <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> combate with <hi>Marcion</hi> out of Scripture in his <hi>de carne Chriſti, ch.</hi> 6. <hi>Si non probant quia nec ſcriptum eſt:</hi> and again, <hi>ſed nihil de eo conſtat, quia Scriptura non exhibet:</hi> and again, ch. 7. <hi>Non recipio quod extra Scripturam de tuo infers.</hi> And why did he proceed againſt <hi>Hermogenes</hi> by Scripture, in his 22. ch. againſt him, <hi>Adoro Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae plenitudinem:</hi> and again, <hi>Scriptum eſſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat Hermogenis officina.</hi> But fifthly, if we ſhould ſend the Sectaries to your Church for ſatisfaction, would this make an end of the differences? For the firſt queſtion would be, how your Church was proved to be the infallible Church? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all that do diſpute out of it, do acknowledge to be the word of God: but all do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your Church. Sixthly, if the Church could end ſo well all differences, why are ſo many queſtions undetermined, as about the Pope in relation to temporals, in relation to Councils: about predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, about Immaculate Conception of the Virgin? Why are not theſe made an end of? Nay, ſeventhly, Hereticks have combated with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, and many were not ſatisfied with the determinations of Trent. Therefore let them not prejudice Scripture by the obſtinacy of Sectaries. Had not the Sectaries been ſet on and armed with their principles they might ſooner have been over come: and if nothing ſhould be made uſe of for our neceſſary direction but that which is convictive of
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:40740:276"/> all, my Adverſary might in reaſon have ſate ſtill, or brought better Arguments. Sectaries are not apt to be ruled by the meanes of Scripture: but his <hi>mediums</hi> are not apt to rule me without it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I could ſmile at it, that Pontificians ſhould uſe this expreſſion, that the <hi>Church is the King's High way;</hi> when as ſome principles of ſome of the chief of them do diſpoſe them as they think fit, to take Kings out of the way. But this by the way. Indeed their Church will lead us to <hi>Rome</hi> but not to truth. The univerſall Church will lead us ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to truth than to <hi>Rome.</hi> But what way have we to lead us to this way? If the Church were the Kings high way, how ſhall we know how to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the road? If we had a mind to go <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in the Fathers ſenſe, the midle way; we ſhould make uſe of the univerſall Church to find that which is held to be Scripture; and then go in the way of Scripture, which is Gods High way. And ſurely the Royall law is like to be the Royall way. And which is more reaſonable, that the Scripture ſhould be onely a directory to the Church, or the Church a directory to Scripture: if the former, then when we know the Church, we may leave the direction of Scripture and bid it goe back; for now we know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> way: and ſo the Scripture ſhould not be neceſſary, which yet is held by the Papiſts generally, and elſewhere acknowledged b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my Adverſary: if the latter, then is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the high way to truth. And therefore in the debate of truth the appeale lies from the Church to Scripture; not contrariwiſe. And ſo it muſt, for a diſtinct and perfect knowledge of the Church
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:40740:277"/> we muſt have from the Scripture, as before. So that that which is the rule of the rule muſt be the rule of that which is ruled, even in that wherein it is a rule. So then in the ſearch of truth we muſt make the Scripture to be the way of our reſolution, becauſe by it we muſt know diſtinctly the Church. And not onely ſo, in the ſearch of this truth, which is the true Church: but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truths too which are neceſſary; unleſſe the Scripture ſhould refer us to the Church abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for truth: which is not yet demonſtrated. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as to humane perſwaſion, we plead the Church; as to faith, we plead the Scripture. By the Church we come to know what goes for truth in it: but by Scripture we come to know, whether that which goes for truth be ſo indeed. In things of queſtion and of diſcipline we are not ſtoicall to the Church; but in buſineſs of faith we muſt be Scepticks notwithſtanding; were there any need in ſuch things to ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Things of faith may prevent queſtions on either ſide; things of queſtion require no faith by neceſſity of matter on either ſide.</p>
            <p>That he adds, <hi>ſince by that means</hi> (of Scripture onely) <hi>either neither ſide will be victorious, or it is a hazard whether;</hi> is not neceſſary to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſince we have formerly ſhewed the neceſſity of <hi>appealing to Scriptures</hi> and <hi>diſputing out of</hi> them onely (as to faith in things of faith) which my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary would deny me upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this debate out of Scripture would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a certain and clear victory. And as for victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we hope they intend it not. No body is to get the victory in theſe diſputes: for they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for truth. And for what is neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, we have in Scripture the plain truth, and
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:40740:277"/> what is not neceſſary, one may have that victory and not the truth; and ſo one may have the truth and not the victory. Let them ſhew us truth and they ſhall not ſtay for the victory.</p>
            <p>That which follows in this Sexion is convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retorted, and more to my Adverſary. <hi>Theſe things he might have learned from the antienteſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as before, <hi>if</hi> he <hi>had regarded their Doctrine. Yet ſince their authority hath ſo low a place in</hi> his <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in order to the finding out of truth,</hi> which is againſt them, he doth not <hi>lay aſide all that might be ſaid out of the Fathers</hi> to <hi>humor</hi> me, as he ſays, but upon ſome other good reaſon: methinks he ſhould not ſo far ſpare his Adverſary, if he did ſee him not to be well guarded on that part, But, it is like, the truth is, when they produce the Fathers for them, then we muſt be their Children abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is more than they would have us doe: but when we produce the Fathers for us, then they will not be their children at all. They muſt have the Fathers come all the way to them: otherwiſe they have nothing to ſay to them. Surely we had more reaſon to refuſe any dealing with the Fathers, becauſe we cannot recognize them as infallible, than my Adverſaries, who acknowledge them, when they pleaſe them, to be ſuch. And if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Fathers be part of their principles they bragge of, they are to ſtand to their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when we diſpute with them out of them; or elſe they betray them. We are not bound to ſtand to their principles, but they are bound by their own Laws, to anſwer to them.</p>

               </gap>s <hi>to ſubmit to Generall Councils,</hi> as controlling turbulent oppoſition, or in points of outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Church, I grant it: but if he takes it by an infallibility ingaging faith, then I deny it. Thoſe virtues are of uſe to the former ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to the latter. In the firſt ſenſe of Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Humility is diſpoſitive; but not the <hi>actus Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> as he ſays of moſt ſubmiſſive obedience. The <hi>actus Imperans</hi> of this externall ſubmiſſion is an act of internall obedience to God, as commanding ſuch obedience to the orders of thoſe whom under pain of damnation we are bound to obey, but in things lawfull and honeſt onely. And no further are we obliged to obedience. Therefore whereas he ſpeaks as if under pain of damnation we are bound
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:40740:278"/> to <hi>obey</hi> them univerſally it is not ſo. And it will not be <hi>Humility</hi> to obey them in all things redupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catively, but Pride againſt God. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who underſtand their duty, ſaid, Acts 4, 19. Whether it be juſt to obey God or you, judge ye.</p>
            <p>But it may be a generall Council cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing unlawfull; ſo they ſay. No? They cannot <hi>de jure;</hi> but ſurely it is poſſible: were not the Apoſtles then commanded, after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had conſulted, not to preach in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? And if they ſay the Council erred not in faith herein, but in point of action, we anſwer, firſt, they erred in the faith of a practicall point: that practicall <hi>dictamen,</hi> that ſuch a command might be laid upon them, was erroneous. Secondly, they erred, <hi>ex conſequenti,</hi> in this moſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall point, that Jeſus is the Chriſt. And therefore thirdly, they erred ſo far, as by their error they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed Chriſtian Religion. Therefore infallibility doth not univocably belong to Councils: therefore may they erre: therefore are we not abſolutely to obey them: therefore Humility doth not diſpoſe ſimply to an obedience of faith; ſuch Humility is voluntary humility, and not a virtue.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Divels Rebellion</hi> he ſpeaks of, for want of <hi>Humility,</hi> is not much to his purpoſe, though true: will this conſequence be weighty, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill by Pride rebelled againſt God, therefore we by Humility would believe a Council in whatſoever they ſay? we are diſputing now upon the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of belief, as he would have it: now the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill did not rebell againſt God in point of diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which reſpects the underſtanding; but in point of independency, which reſpects the will. The Divels Rebellion was againſt God, as the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:40740:279"/> Bonum,</hi> not as the <hi>Summum Verum.</hi> For as to belief ſimple, if there were a proper obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in it, they ſeem to believe ſtill, and therefore to be obedient, if this were an obedience: becauſe they are ſaid to <hi>believe and tremble.</hi> And their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion was a ſin of malice; and this ſpeaks a moſt free oppoſition of the will: but our unbelief of ſome things decreed in Councils, is neceſſary to the underſtanding as not ſeeing reaſon of aſſent; and therefore is it not to be charged upon want of Humillity.</p>
            <p>Whereas then he ſays Pride <hi>is ſtiled the Mother of Hereſie,</hi> it is eaſily diſtinguiſhed, that in Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie there are two parts, the materiall part, which is, the holding of that which is contrary to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith; and the formall part, which is the obſtinate oppoſing the Church in it. Pride is the Mother of the latter: but it is not abſolutely the Mother of the former. For the Apoſtles did not diſbelieve at firſt the Reſurrection of Chriſt upon pride. And then St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not have excuſed himſelf in the perſecution of the Church, that he did it by ignorance, and ſo there could be no ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple error. So that what he ſays is not here perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: for we are now in diſpute about the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith, in his ſenſe; not about the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of peace. His argument concludes the latter rather than the former.</p>
            <p>And this he prompts me to in his next words, <hi>Now as Humility bringeth with her this neceſſary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the interiour: ſo Charity is the vertue which will be ſure to ſee that peace and unity be kept exteriourly in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The former part is ſufficiently evacuated, Humility and faith are not of the ſame Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: faith hiſtoricall (which we ſpeake of) or
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:40740:279"/> dogmatical, is ſubjected in the underſtanding; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is a morall vertue. And a morall virtue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſpeculative principle. Neither are they always of a combination. For he that is humble is not always in the right opinion; and he that is proud is not always in the wrong opinion. And if Pride were but ſymptomaticall to error, it would be ill for <hi>Rome.</hi> But for the latter part, that <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> will endeavour to keep <hi>peace and unity,</hi> is not like to be denied, yet we muſt ſee that our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Unity be regular, we muſt not for Charity loſe Truth; though in purſuance of Truth we muſt not loſe Charity. We hold our own, and give good words of others. We would be one in judgement, and that is of Charity: but not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to any in error; ſo we ſhould forſake truth. However we will not differ in love; for we can love thoſe that differ, and pray for them: and be ready to joine with them when they will leave their error, or not injoin it to us.</p>
            <p>Indeed the uſe of Councils is more reſpective to the formal part of hereſie: and therefore we do formally ſatisfie them in reverence and peace; duely weighing what they decree, and decreeing to hold what is due. Grant no other ſubmiſſion; and urge no other <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to any <hi>Councils,</hi> and we have done.</p>
            <p>Here the firſt five lines do beg the queſtion which we have been diſputing of,<note place="margin">Par. 15.</note> and if they did of themſelves prove any thing, would prove more than that he ſpeaks of, <hi>exteriour unity.</hi> For if the Church did unerrably lead us into truth, as the <hi>Kings High way,</hi> then we ſhould have one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perſwaſion, which would make interiour unity. But though <hi>exteriour unity,</hi> as he ſpeaks, is not ſufficient to his diſpute, yet is it enough for
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:40740:280"/> the demand of the Church viſible. The Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible (which, as ſuch, hath a neceſſary connexion with ſalvation) conſiſts of thoſe who do agree as one in points propoſed by God, becauſe they are to be believed; and are ready to believe what is to be believed becauſe propoſed, when the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall is clear. But the Church viſible is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his exteriour unity, which is not broken by private ſuſpenſion of aſſent, for this exteriour unity is ſufficiently conſerved, negatively, by a <hi>non</hi> oppoſition. Exteriour unity is contradiſtinguiſhed to interiour, he provides for exteriour unity, then he provides for that which is contradiſtinguiſhed to faith. What then is become of the application of all his diſcourſe to faith in Councils?</p>
            <p>But to let this paſſe. I ſee he doth not like my Syllogiſm for him. I put his matter in as good a form as it would bear in ſhort and categorically: but he is not pleaſed with it; and therefore without further anſwer to it, he ſays, he will do it yet <hi>more clearly for</hi> himſelf <hi>in this manner: under pain of damnation all are bound to agree in this, that every one interiourly giveth an infallible aſſent to all ſuch points as are neceſſary to be believed for ſalvation: but all can never be brought to agree in giving ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly this infallible aſſent to all ſuch points, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they ſubmit their aſſent to ſome living Judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with infallibility. Therefore all can never be brought to agree in that in which they are bound to agree under pain of damnation, without they all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their interiour aſſent to ſome living Judge indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is his Syllogiſm. And an anſwer is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to it, although he would give no anſwer to mine, which gave him a diſtinction able enough to ſave the text, he ſeems to build upon, from his
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:40740:280"/> impropriation of it. Yet we will give anſwer to his own form.</p>
            <p>And as to his <hi>major,</hi> we grant it, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is neceſſary to ſalvation is ſo far neceſſary to be believed as it is injoined unto ſalvation. And that propoſition of his is clearer than his proof; for his reaſon doth not infer it, namely, <hi>becauſe all are obliged to pleaſe God, and to have that faith without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ebr.</note> For let the reaſon be put into form of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then let any one ſee whether it will be cogent thus: all are obliged to pleaſe God and to have that faith without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; therefore his <hi>major</hi> is true, under pain of damnation all are bound to agree, &amp;c. No, one and the other are true, but one is not proved to be true by the other: that <hi>axiom</hi> in the ſcope of it ſpeaks of a faith as to that place onely in this particular, that there is a God. And therefore doth not this text aptly prove a neceſſity of interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our aſſent to all points neceſſary to be believed for ſalvation. It ſeems by the compendiouſneſſe of that text, that very few principles are neceſſary to be believed unto ſalvation, becauſe (according to my Adverſary) we may pleaſe God with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief according to this text, which intends but that one main Principle, that <hi>there is a God, and that he is a rewarder of them that dilligently ſeek him.</hi> And ſo this will abate the plea of Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> and of my Adverſary, who contend, that there is a great number of things which are neceſſary to be believed <hi>under pain of damnation.</hi> And if he would extend that text virtually to a neceſſity of particular perſwaſion, that whatſoever we do is lawfull (as if it ſhould have the ſame ſenſe with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>whatſover is not of faith is ſin</hi>)
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:40740:281"/> Firſt, that is not the meaning of the text. And then ſecondly, ſo it would exceed his purpoſe, which is for points of faith: for ſo it would alſo have reference to things indifferent; unto which the other text is properly applied.</p>
            <p>Well, let us ſee his <hi>minor</hi> proved. He proveth it thus, <hi>An infallible aſſent cannot be built but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubmiſſion to an infallible authority, and no other infallible authority ſufficient to breed this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their interiour aſſent to all points neceſſary can be aſſigned but the authority of the Church.</hi> Well, the <hi>major</hi> of this Syllogiſm we grant: but firſt, how proves he the <hi>minor?</hi> (And yet we might alſo except againſt the form of it; for it ſhould be thus for the <hi>minor,</hi> but there is no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible authority but the Church; and yet ſo the form is not right neither; for the <hi>medium</hi> is not duly placed) But how proves he the <hi>minor?</hi> For this is yet to us the queſtion: out of queſtion he may prove what he will, if he can make the queſtion proof. And therefore leſt his <hi>minor</hi> ſhould appear to be groſly falſe, (for he by and by acknowledgeth the Scriptures authority to be infallible) and leſt that <hi>minor,</hi> as it ſhould be formed, ſhould not fully infer the <hi>minor</hi> of his proſyllogiſm, he ſhuffles in in the <hi>minor</hi> of his laſt, more than ſhould be.</p>
            <p>And let me now make uſe of his principles. Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. In all definitions of the Church I cannot have faith. Therefore in all definitions of the Church I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God. The firſt propoſition is Scripture, and a principle which he alſo uſeth. My ſecond propoſition I prove by his proof of his, thus. <hi>An infallible aſſent cannot be built but upon ſubmiſſion to an infallible authority.</hi> The Church is not yet
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:40740:281"/> proved to have infallible authority; therefore cannot we have infallible aſſent in the definitions of the Church, and by conſequent, not faith; for faith is in the nature of it an infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Then towards the confirmation of his laſt <hi>minor,</hi> he comes over with the deniall of this property to Scripture, <hi>The authority of Scripture, though infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, doth not give us clear texts to ground our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſent upon them in all points neceſſary to ſalvation, as I ſhall ſhew in the next chap.</hi> This is begging of the queſtion in the ſecond chap. not in the third, if it be there proved, but here he affords me then that which is a poſitive <hi>minor</hi> to my laſt Syllogiſm againſt him; and compleatly it is made by his own principles now, infallible aſſent is not built but upon ſubmiſſion to an infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Authoritie of Scripture is infallible. Therefore, Both his own propoſitions. Onely the form of the diſcourſe follows his.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding its infallible authority, he ſays, <hi>It doth not give clear texts to ground our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſent upon them in all points neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> So that now all the queſtion ſeems to be reduced to the debate about the clearneſs of the texts. He ſeems not to deny the texts in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but denies them in the adjunct of clearneſſe. Anſ. Firſt, if there be texts for all points neceſſary materially, then is that main opinion of the Papiſts about traditions ſunk: for ſince they are ſaid to come in upon way of ſupply of what is not ſet down at all in Scripture, and yet is neceſſary to be believed, then if all be ſet down in Scripture, but ſome things not clearly, then have we no need of any new matter of traditions, but only of traditive Interpretations, which what they are, and where
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:40740:282"/> they are, who can tell? Secondly, if he ſuppoſeth more points neceſſary to ſalvation than indeed are neceſſary, (as they are wont to do) then indeed the Scripture doth not afford clear texts for all things neceſſary in their opinion; yea, none at all for ſome of their opinions: but as to thoſe things which are really neceſſary, ſo we deny it. The Scripture hath ſufficient clearneſſe for all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary upon due account. Thirdly, The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils do give us no other ſenſe of thoſe texts which are not clear in themſelves, than they are capable of: do they? No, he will ſay; for then they ſhould not declare the ſenſe of Scripture, but make it; which their greateſt Doctors, when they are in their ſober minds, do deny, then are we determined in the Controverſies by thoſe texts, and not by the authority of the Councils. The Councils do but rub the glaſſe that we may ſee more clearly the ſenſe, but it is the ſenſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the point. They do not make the way of truth, but ſhew it, and therefore the Church is not the High way, but the Scripture. If they by their diſcuſſion and diſcourſe add one degree of claritude to thoſe texts, muſt the cauſality formal of the aſſent be attributed to their authority? They do but make clear the object; the aſſent of faith is not to the degree of clearneſſe, but to the object cleared. Fourthly, what if ſome of the greateſt Doctors do give all this power of explication of ambiguous Scripture to the Pope, and he conſtitutes the ſenſe imperially, not expounds it rationally; and makes his authority antecedent to the ſenſe, and not the ſenſe antecedent to their definition; but <hi>ipſo facto</hi> this muſt be the meaning thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith ſo? Is this a clearing of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Fifthly, it muſt be clear to me that the
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:40740:282"/> Councils have cleared the difficulty: otherwiſe I ſhould deny my aſſent to the text, becauſe it is not clear in the conſtruction, and yet ſhould give my aſſent to the Councils determination, and yet this not clear to me neither. Now then, if they will have us judge of the definition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that ſo we may determine our aſſent, (for we muſt by judgement conclude the Council clearly to determine the ſenſe in queſtion, or elſe we cannot give any due aſſent) why will they not allow us to judge alſo of the ſenſe of Scripture, that ſo rationally we may believe it? Sixthly, as the clarity is wanting, (as I ſuppoſe he means) but to ſome texts, ſo alſo but to ſome perſons; and therefore is there not an abſolute need to all of this infallible Judge. Yea, how many took liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſuſpend their aſſents to the determinations of the Council of Trent: and yet they would have a Council to be binding to others? Seventhly, is the defect of the degree of claritude negative or privative? not privative; for that will charge God. And ſo that of <hi>Nilus</hi> will be true to be ſure, <hi>he that accuſeth the Scripture accuſeth God:</hi> but if negative, it is no other than God thought fit for his word. And do we think that God would require, under pain of damnation, belief to his word, and yet not give unto it competent clearneſſe reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the points of faith neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Eighthly, what then muſt we think, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſalvation, of all thoſe antient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for ſome centuries, wherein they had not a Generall Council? were they all loſt? Or had they faith without a Generall Council? If the former, how do they ſay the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church? And why do they alſo not diſ-acknowledge thoſe times of the
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:40740:283"/> Church to have been the pureſt? And were ſo many of them Martyrs and yet loſt? But if the latter, then alſo may we have faith without a Generall Council ſufficiently to ſalvation. Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſenſes of Scripture as to particular points were clear to the Fathers in the Council ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally before they gave their ſuffrages on either part; were they not? If not, how came they to vote for that ſenſe which was right? If ſo, then the product of the Councils definition is not it which clears the ſenſe of the Scripture to them, and conſequently not to us. Tenthly and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Scripture doth not give us clear texts for all points neceſſary, and therefore we muſt ſtand to the authority of the Church; then alſo the Church ſhall not be it upon which we rely as a competent Judge; becauſe the Church, even in a Council, doth not deliver the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo clearely as to end all controverſies. And this manifeſtly appears by peruſall of the Trent Hiſtory, wherein it frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, that the Decrees and Canons were ſo framed as to give a liberty of divers ſenſes for more ſatisfaction, and ſatisfaction to more.</p>
            <p>And this laſt account in this laſt particular doth make ſufficient reply to what he ſpeaks in the ten next following lines; wherein he objects to me the difference of thoſe amongſt us to proceed from our acknowledgement of Scripture to be the triall of faith. Surely he did not the ſame day conſider the differences at home. It is not proper to object that which is common, we can retort it <hi>mutatis mutandis, And we ſee with our eys thoſe who ſubmit to the authority of</hi> the Church <hi>as infallible, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:40740:283"/> mainly in theſe very points,</hi> which the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod hath ſpoken of: <hi>for one thinketh in his Conſcience</hi> the Church <hi>is to be underſtood one way, another thinketh in his Conſcience</hi> it <hi>is to be underſtood another way; and this other is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed</hi> (interpretatively by the Synod) <hi>to differ even from the greateſt authority upon earth,</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinks; becauſe he thinks the Synod hath defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for him. And then he may eaſily have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to <hi>differ from another private man, and that other private man hath as good ground to differ from the other.</hi> So our Adverſaries incuſſion of our differences amongſt us is patly repercuſſed upon them; and with more weight and edge too; becauſe ſecondly, we holding a difference of points by the matter, are capable of more excuſe for our diſagreements in things not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall; than they, who holding all equally upon the propoſall of the Church, muſt needs differ in that which is equally fundamentall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that is defined by the Church is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo. Yea, alſo he that errs in one point with the Papiſts, according to Mr. <hi>Knot's</hi> argument, hath faith in none. And one of them that differ about the ſenſe of the Council muſt needs err, though it is undetermined which. And therefore third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, would not my Adverſaries have been pleaſed with ſuch an argument from me, The Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do diſagree, therefore their opinion is the cauſe thereof, and if that ſhould be the cauſe, we ſhould all diſagree, and in all. Neither fourthly, doe we licenſe any to differ, but they take their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty to ſuſpend aſſent till they ſee the word of God, as well as upon good reaſons you move men to chuſe your Religion. And therefore, as to neceſſaries, Scripture is the <hi>poſſible means of
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:40740:284"/> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in the interior man, in which faith onely doth conſiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Union we are to conſider in order to Salvation; not the exteriour union, which is not ſo neceſſary, though ſimply deſirable. As far as truth will go, it muſt go with it, but not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And yet this is now and then mingled in the diſcourſe of my Adverſary: and very politickly; becauſe the Church hath more conjunction with an exteriour union of peace, than an interiour of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What you add of God his ſufficiently providing for his Church by Scripture onely is in this ſenſe true, that in Scripture we read that we are to hear the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Surely I do not owe, in ingenuity, any thanks to any Adverſary of mine for this, that they ſeem thus to pleaſe themſelves in a ſtudy how to make our opinion tollerable. If I do, I will ſoon be out of debt, as ſoon as I can ſay, that their opinion, about the Church to be the High way to truth, is ſo far true; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was wont to ſend us to the Scripture for our rule of faith and manners; as hath been ſhewed. Secondly, what Council ever determined the ſenſe of that precept, <hi>goe tell the Church</hi> to be underſtood of a Council as to bind abſolutely to the belief of all that they propound? And if a Council had not defined this the ſenſe, then how ſhall we know it to be the ſenſe, by my Adverſary; becauſe he ſaies, we muſt reſolve our faith in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Council? and if it hath defined that the ſenſe, how came they to have authority to define this to be the ſenſe of the place? If not clear to this purpoſe, how came they to divine infallibly
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:40740:284"/> this ſenſe? for the Scripture according to them did not appear to have this ſenſe without a Council; then, who gave authority to the firſt Council to give this infallibly to be the ſenſe? If clear, then have we no ſuch neceſſity of an infallible Judge for umpiring of litigant ſenſes, Thirdly, Tell it to the Church, <hi>ex vi authoritatis,</hi> as to teach: not <hi>ex vi infallibilitatis,</hi> in teaching: in regard of authority as to perſons: not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, as to truth. Repreſentatively, in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; not abſolutely, in the matter. We are to hear them as authorized to teach: but not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to believe them, as if they were aſſiſted not to err. He that is appointed by Chriſt, and doth ſay that which is falſe, is not to be believed; becauſe, if he ſaies that which is true, it is not to be accounted true, becauſe he ſaies ſo, but he is to be accounted as to ſpeak true, becauſe it is ſo: yea, they may know that that text was applied by Chriſt as to cenſure in points of treſpaſſe, not to obedience in points of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not that Scripture alone by her ſelf endeth all our differences, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Who ever ſaid ſo? Who is his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? It were eaſie to have the victory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Adverſary, if poſſible. No; Nor the Church <hi>alone by her ſelf.</hi> But we ſay alſo, the Scripture doth not formally end any, as they would have a living Judge; and yet is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in neceſſaries; for by propoſing plainly what is neceſſary, it concludes neceſſarily againſt the neceſſitie of a living Judge infallible. What is neceſſary more than to believe that which is neceſſary? And therefore no need of traditions: and what more plain than that there
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:40740:285"/> is no need of an infallible Judge, as to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince what is neceſſary is plainly delivered in Scripture? It is ſufficient in the matter for neceſſaries: and it is clear enough in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to points of faith underſtood <hi>ſignanter.</hi> And would we be ruled by Scripture, there would be fewer Controverſies in the Church, and of the Church. And were not their Church a party for it ſelf, it would give all to Scripture. The intereſs of the Church hath brought in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, not for ſalvation, but for its authority. And the Scripture muſt not clearly have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all points neceſſary, becauſe then what repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would be given to the authority and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the Church?</p>
            <p>But we are invited much to the third chap. and expectation is raiſed, wherein he ſaies, <hi>when I ſhall have fully ſet down the ſtate of the queſtion, you ſhall find all that you add in this place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, he ſayes, ſhould be done before it be ſaid. If he will prove, that we muſt err in point of ſalvation without obedience to their judge. If he will prove, that all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is damnative: and if he can prove, that their Church, or the Church hath not erred, yea, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err; then we will excuſe him for repetitions in the third chap. for he cannot come off hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely with anſwering in a third chap. what was ſaid in a former, more fully, unleſſe he ſaies much more to what is ſaid, than what he hath yet ſaid. But we do not prejudice his Judge.</p>

               <hi>You deliver your opinion in your anſwer to my third Num. p.</hi> 12. thus. And then he tels me my opinion; of which he ſays, <hi>no proof was given by you untill you came to this preſent place.</hi> For proof he hath had as much as could reaſonably be required, and more, I ſuppoſe, than he deſired. But I was to follow him: and therefore he was not to accuſe me. And he might then have begun with the proof, if he would have made ſhort work.</p>
            <p>He then prepares himſelf to reinforce the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. And therefore he ſaies, <hi>And firſt, I will take leave to ſtate this queſtion a little more fully and diſtinctly.</hi>

And ſo he ends his firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your aſſertion then is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, this is my aſſertion. And I am not aſhamed of it yet: for it is not mine alone; but
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:40740:286"/> the Scriptur's; and St. <hi>Auſtin's,</hi> and others, as he hath heard before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this aſſertion there be two things which need<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full, and diſtinct declaration; the firſt is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare theſe words [neceſſary to ſalvation] the ſecond to declare thoſe words [plainly ſet down.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Content, let him be as good as his word, onely let him take care he doth not, as ſome he knew, confound that which is to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and diſtinguiſh that which is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. So let him turn his anſwering to what I ſaid againſt his aſſertion into an oppoſition of mine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And firſt, concerning thoſe words neceſſary to ſalvation, they muſt of neceſſity be underſtood ſo, that all things are plainly ſet down in Scripture, which are neceſſary, firſt, to the univerſall Church, as it is a Community. Secondly, all things neceſſary to all ſtates and degrees that muſt needs be in this Community. Thirdly, all things neceſſary to every perſon bound to be of this Community.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This way he thought to deſtroy my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, as Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> does, to deſtroy the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth:</hi> but it will not do. For here is he faulty, in confounding that which is to be diſtinguiſhed. He ſhould have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed betwixt neceſſaries to ſalvation, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to the univerſall Church, as it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity: though all that is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary to the Church taken confuſely of the perſons: yet whatſoever is neceſſary to the univerſall Church as a Community, is not neceſſary to ſalvation; for then before there was a competent aggregation in a Community, there was no poſſibility of ſalvation. And that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:40740:286"/> is to be ſaved by the holding of things neceſſary, is it not? Yes, he would ſay, then this Community doth not come in to integrate things neceſſary to ſalvation: and if not, then thoſe things which are neceſſary to this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, doth not come in neither. Then he ſhould have done well, ſecondly, to have diſtinguiſhed betwixt a Church in its being, and in its well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All things are not neceſſary to the being of a Church, which are requiſite to the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of it. Now ſalvation may be had in a Church which hath not its due well being. And thirdly, he might have diſtinguiſhed betwixt neceſſity abſolute and neceſſity of Convenience, with the School-men. All things are not neceſſary in the firſt kind, which are neceſſary in the latter. Now we are upon neceſſaries in the firſt kind. And as to theſe, fewer things there are of this order. Theſe things are confounded for their advantage. But alſo he ſeems to diſtinguiſh what is to be confounded; for he ſeems to make ſome things neceſſary for the univerſall Church, <hi>as a Community.</hi> Whereas more is not neceſſary to the univerſall Church upon the formality of a Community. This was touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but herein he doth diſtinguiſh where he ſhould not diſtinguiſh.</p>
            <p>And thus by diſtinguiſhing what is not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, and by confounding what is to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, he would confound me in the change of the ſtate of the queſtion. But this vain and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. For the ſtate of the queſtion reſpects men <hi>in communi,</hi> not in a Community. Then ſecondly, ſuppoſe that the Scripture had not given us gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall directions concerning the conſtitution of the Church, and the Officers of it, and the power of thoſe Officers, and obedience to that power in
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:40740:287"/> things of free obſervation in themſelves, yet our aſſertion would be ſound and good, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſet down plainly all things neceſſary to ſalvation. Some were ſaved before ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity: ſome may be ſaved who are wrongfully put out of ſuch a Community; and ſome may be ſaved after ſuch a Community is obſcured, and in the darke, as they confeſſe the Church ſhall be in the time of Antichriſt. But then thirdly, the Scripture hath ſufficiently provided, and as much as is neceſſary to be ſure, <hi>how the Church is to be provided in all times and places of lawfull Paſtors.</hi> And alſo what power the <hi>Paſtors ſhould have in reſpect of one another, or in reſpect to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar flocks.</hi> And how thoſe laws they make ſhould bind without appointing <hi>how many ſhould be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to this effect.</hi> And alſo who ſhould <hi>call</hi> this <hi>Aſſembly, who preſide in it,</hi> when there are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates; at leaſt negatively, not the Pope, (who hath nothing to ſhew for himſelf in Scripture) nor the Antient Church. And alſo <hi>when it is to be accounted lawfull, when unlawfull.</hi> This is ſufficiently determinable in Scripture by analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to the Jewiſh Kings, and to the Aſſembly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts.</hi> As for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtration of theſe Aſſemblies will they ſay, it is <hi>de jure Divino?</hi> And as for the queſtion, <hi>whether the Precepts of this Aſſembly oblige under pain of damnation, to the keeping of Feaſts, or Faſts, or Eaves,</hi> we ſay firſt, it doth appear in Scripture, that obedience to lawfull authority is due indefinitely and in generall; when there is no reall exception againſt the matter. And therefore by the Command of God are we bound in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, injoyning nothing but that which is lawfull. But though they do bind under pain of
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:40740:287"/> damnation; yet is not this a point neceſſary to be known under pain of damnation. The queſtion with us is not whether they do thus bind, but whether we cannot be ſaved without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whether they do thus bind. And if we may be ſaved without this knowledge, then is it not neceſſary to Salvation, that this ſhould be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For though it be neceſſary for us to know that all ſin is damnative (and this is ſufficiently laid down in Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. laſt:) yet is it not neceſſary under pain of damnation that we ſhould know every ſin that is damnative; for then we ſhould have no pardon for ſecret ſins by generall Repentance; and then who could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? And therefore though to every one that knows that this is a true propoſition, that Precepts of the Aſſembly do bind under pain of damnation, it is neceſſary to exerciſe actuall particular Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for thoſe tranſgreſſions which he knows; yet to him that knows not the truth of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it is not. And this is known to be a ſchool queſtion. And though they bind more than in caſe of ſcandall and of contempt, yet muſt their obligation mediate be underſtood to be qualified after the manner of the ceremoniall law, not the morall; and therefore in competition with morals their binding is relaxed. Again, if it were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that thoſe obſervations ſhould be generall, why did not the firſt Councils eſtabliſh them? Yea, it ſeems, it was not neceſſary that all ſuch obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations ſhould be univerſally practiſed: For then how came the Eaſtern and Brittiſh Churches to differ from the Roman obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their pretences of preeminence? Yea, one of the Antients in application to the obſerving of <hi>Eaſther,</hi> which for the time he thought was free,
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:40740:288"/> gave this ſentence, in <hi>Euſebius.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; the difference of faſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the agreement of faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Adverſary doth, amongſt his Feſtivities he mentions, wiſely conceal the mention of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> becauſe he knew the differences from the Roman Church in that particular.</p>
            <p>And for the ſame form of <hi>publick ſervice,</hi> which <hi>ought to be impoſed on all,</hi> and <hi>when all are bound to be preſent at it;</hi> would any one ſay, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what he ſaies, that this is neceſſary to be, and to be known unto ſalvation? If he means to be <hi>impoſed upon all,</hi> in the Catholick Church, what Scripture, or what Father, or what Council hath he for it? Indeed <hi>Ignatius</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, ſayes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but this was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as to a particular Church. And ſome cannot come to Church; and may not they be ſaved? and ſome particular nations muſt have ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paſſages which are common to all the parts of that nation and not to other nations. And doe Canonicall hours ſo bind, as, not to be where they are, or not to aſſiſt always, upon morall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, excludes <hi>de ſe</hi> from Heaven? When the time of Antichriſt comes, according to them, ſurely their Canonical hours will not be in ſeaſon; and yet they will ſay, ſalvation may be had in the Church. Whereas neceſſaries to ſalvation do not fall under a neceſſity to be diſpenſed with. And therefore if ſuch obſervances are excuſable by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, it is ſure that they are not in our ſenſe neceſſary. Theſe are onely <hi>juris poſitivi,</hi> as they diſtinguiſhed in the Trent Council: but to be ſure that which is neceſſary to ſalvation is <hi>juris Divini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>what Sacraments are to be adminiſtred</hi> the Scripture telleth us expreſſely. For <hi>time,</hi> it is not
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:40740:288"/> neceſſary to have it determined, nor <hi>how often;</hi> but for the <hi>eſſentiall form</hi> it is ſet down: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall manner is not ſimply neceſſary. Here he confounds cunningly, and mixeth ſomewhat neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary with ſomewhat not neceſſary. Neither doth he diſtinguiſh betwixt neceſſity of precept and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of meane, ſomewhat is neceſſary in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way which is not neceſſary in the latter. And this latter is it with which we have to debate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the right ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All theſe things,</hi> he ſays, <hi>are neceſſary to a Church as a Community.</hi> To follow him again, we ſay, firſt, that we deny that all theſe things are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to a Church as a community: for ſeverall Churches have differed from one another in ſome of them; as in Faſts, and in the keeping of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and in forms of Prayer: for as for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies they talk of, they are <hi>filii populi.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though neceſſary to a Church, yet not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation. Thirdly, ſome of them may be neceſſary to a Church viſible, not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Church as inviſible: but he tampers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the change of the ſtate of the queſtion, to make what is neceſſary to ſalvation to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a Church as viſible; and whatſoever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a Church as viſible; to be neceſſary to ſalvation; which cannot be true. For as for that, that there is no ſalvation to be had out of the Church, (according to that of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his <hi>Tract. de ſimplicitate Prelatorum, Habere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Deum Patrem qui Eccleſiam non habet Matrem</hi>) yet this is to be underſtood of thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of the Church, as is to be ſeen there by the comparation of antecedents and conſequents and the whole ſcope of the <hi>Tract.</hi> And therefore ſimply what is neceſſary to a Church viſible is not
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:40740:289"/> neceſſary to ſalvation; becauſe, without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Father, it may be poſſible to have ſalvation without the Church. And therefore may I conclude that my Adverſary did not well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his promiſe of ſtating this queſtion <hi>a little more fully and diſtinctly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet there is not one of all theſe things plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in Scripture, whence very many and very important differences be amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> All he ſays is not true. For the Sacraments are plainly enough ſet down in Scripture; for all that is therein eſſentiall and neceſſary. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Argument is not concluding, theſe things are not plainly ſet down in Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very many and very important differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians. For firſt the unplaineſſe of them in Scripture is no efficient cauſe thereof; for they might in thoſe things give every one their liberty in their particular Churches; as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth plainly ſhew us in his ſecond <hi>B.</hi> firſt <hi>Ep.</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken of ſome who did hold thoſe things which they did once take up, he ſpeaks notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding—<hi>ſed, ſalvo inter Collegas pacis et Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae vinculo, quaedam propria quae apud ſe ſemel ſunt uſurpata, retinere; quae in re nec nos cuiquam facimus, aut legem damus, cum habeat in Eccleſiae adminiſtrationis voluntatis ſuae arbitrium liberum unuſquiſquae praepoſitus, rationem actus ſui Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no redituras.</hi> So he: Therefore may they not all practiſe the ſame thing, and yet there be no morall difference: if negative differences, not poſitive contentions: if ſome, yet not many: if many, yet not important, in point of ſalvation, becauſe each Biſhop in his Church hath free power to eſtabliſh what he thinks fit. And what Generall Council
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:40740:289"/> hath bound the univerſall Church in all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities? Yea, again, the unplaineſs of theſe things in Scripture is not the <hi>cauſa ſine quae non</hi> of theſe differences: for there are differences with the Roman Church againſt others, even in ſome things which are plainly ſet down in Scripture: as in point of juſtification, againſt Images to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: againſt half Communion; and generally the differences betwixt us. And indeed what is there ſo plain about which ſome have not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? And then again, how is this mended by a Council? Not by their Council of Trent; becauſe in their Decrees the ſenſe is not plain. Therefore let them find better proviſion than God hath made directly in Scripture, before they find fault with Gods direction as to thoſe things which are <hi>important</hi> unto ſalvation: for otherwiſe the term is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is beſide the ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Nextly, he objects the differences amongſt us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Biſhops with ſuch and ſuch a power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that without them you can have no true Prieſts or Deacons, and without theſe no true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, things ſo neceſſary to the ſalvation of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a queſtion belonging rather to the Church than to ſalvation: and therefore we need not ſay any more to it. Yet ſecondly, the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us are for the moſt part ſtirred upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians have no cauſe to impute to us as a fault the diſagreement of Proteſtants in this point; becauſe it ariſeth in great part from the domination of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> They thought by an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they could never ſufficiently gainſay the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Biſhop but by caſhiering the whole <hi>genus;</hi> and
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:40740:290"/> therefore to make all ſure, they denied all Biſhops; ſince the Argument is good <hi>a negatione generis ad negationem ſpeciei;</hi> if no Biſhop, then not univerſal. Indeed here they erred, if they thought that the poſition of Biſhops did inferr the univerſall: for it doth not follow <hi>a poſitione generis ad poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem ſpeciei determinatae:</hi> and therefore they might have Biſhops, and not him. Yea, the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Biſhops by Divine right is as like a mean to deſtroy the Pope's authority as any other. And to this purpoſe was it ſo holty diſputed in the Trent Council: and ſome loſt their favor with the Pope for being eager in the affirmative. And in the promotion of Cardinals at the end of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, the Pope profeſſed he would paſſe by thoſe who had ſtood for Reſidence and Biſhops to be <hi>jure Divino.</hi> For this inſtitution of them by Divine right made them not to depend upon the Pope, which would weaken his authority.</p>
            <p>And therefore as to the Controverſie about Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, whether we derive them and their authority from Scripture, my Adverſary might have done well to have ſaid nothing: ſince if it be neceſſary to be determined clearly, then the Trent Council is to be blamed for not determining it. If it be not neceſſary, then why doth he put it in amongſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary queſtions. To this therefore we ſay no more than thus, Had there not been Biſhops there would not have been a Pope; (and therefore is this an argument that there were Biſhops in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church, for how otherwiſe could there have been a Biſhop univerſall) ſo alſo had there not been a Pope, there would have been leſſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about Biſhops: as appears by this, that if <hi>Petrus Balma,</hi> who was the laſt Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> would have turned Proteſtant, he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Biſhop.</p>
            <pb n="665" facs="tcp:40740:290"/>
            <p>As for <hi>no true Sacraments without Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> we ſay, if he takes Prieſts in a proper ſenſe, we deny that there is now any ſuch to be; becauſe there is now no reall externall ſacrifice. If he takes it in the Analogicall ſenſe, we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of true Prieſts; being rightly ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And for thoſe who have not Biſhops, ſome of them would have them, if it were in their power; as <hi>Bogerman</hi> ſaid, in the Council of <hi>Dort,</hi> when that Government was commended to him, <hi>Domine nos non ſumus adeo felices.</hi> And as for thoſe who are ordained without Biſhops (were this our caſe) we may be as ſure they are true Miniſters, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts can aſſure themſelves that they have true Prieſts; in reſpect of the uncertainties they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the due intention of the Prieſt in Baptiſm, and of the Biſhop in Ordination.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Deacons;</hi> they might have been left out of the rank with Prieſts as to true Sacraments, for it will not appear that Deacons are appointed <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Divino</hi> to aſſiſt the Miniſters in the Sacraments; and if ſo, yet not to be neceſſary to true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they do aſſiſt, otherwiſe no true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What ſhall this alſo with the Romans goe into the account of articles of faith? And ſhall this be as neceſſary to be believed as that Jeſus is the Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sacraments, things ſo neceſſary to the ſalvation of all men.</hi> This we have ſpoken to before: and it comes in here under a ſimple diction, and not poſitively (as it may be interpteted) affirmed; or if [ſo neceſſary] be to be taken <hi>ſignanter,</hi> then is it more eaſily denied, as <hi>to all men.</hi> Our former diſtinction is yet good, neceſſary by neceſſity of precept, not by neceſſity of mean. Neither is the other Sacrament ſo neceſſary as that: and yet are
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:40740:291"/> they put together upon equall neceſſity. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments bind us, not God, to work only by them. And alſo are they adminiſtred as duely with us as elſwhere.</p>
            <p>Then he brings in a Syllogiſm againſt us out of my own words, <hi>What is not plainly delivered in Scripture is thereby ſignified not to be neceſſary: but it is not plainly delivered in Scripture that the Church ſhould be governed by Biſhops with ſuch and ſuch authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he would bring in ſome of thoſe who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them, and us in this point, diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Biſhops. But how would he conclude? Therefore not neceſſary to ſalvation? unleſſe he concludes thus, it doth not contradict us in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. And if he does conclude ſo, he concludes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their intention: for they would conclude no more than that they are not neceſſary to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church: becauſe it is not held by others, that this Government with <hi>ſuch and ſuch authoritie</hi> is ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But to the aſſumption, we ſay, <hi>dato,</hi> that the Government of the Church by Biſhops with ſuch and ſuch power is not plainly ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet let them ſhew as much out of Scripture with the practice of the Church for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> his being univerſall Biſhop, as we can ſhew out of Scripture for Biſhops with ſome authority ſuperior to Preſbyters; and I ſhall think better of their cauſe. And therefore let them remember, <hi>Parvi ſunt foris Arma niſi eſt Conſilium domi.</hi> Let them make ſure at home before they combate us with our own contentions. For ſecondly, as for <hi>ſuch and ſuch authority,</hi> if he takes it for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall point and indiviſible degree, which the Biſhop muſt have, of authority over the reſt of the
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:40740:291"/> Clergie; who is there that ſo contends it, but the Roman? Some ſuperiority in the latitude may be able to conſerve the form: and this is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily proveable out of Scripture with the practice of the Church.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, ſince he hath brought the Antepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coparians upon the ſtage to make ſport for them; what will the Pontificians ſay, if this argument be in earneſt brought againſt them, <hi>whatſoever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is plainly ſet down in Scripture?</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Biſhops <hi>with ſuch and ſuch authoritie is not plainly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> therefore not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The <hi>major</hi> propoſition is yet true and good againſt all his batteries. The <hi>minor</hi> is to have their advice, whether they will affirm it or deny it; let them ſpeak categorically: is it plainly ſet down or not? If it be plainly ſet down, then this inſtance is againſt them, if it be not plainly ſet down, then they have nothing plainly ſet down for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the former rule: if there be no Biſhop plainly ſet down, then not the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> This he gets by our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the form of ordaining Priests</hi> or Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is ſufficiently ſet down, and we have it practiſed with us without the <hi>Patin</hi> and the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice:</hi> and that none but thoſe who are Prieſts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally or eminently, as being more, ſhould bleſſe the bread and conſecrate the Sacrament; this is clearly enough ſet down; and what kind of bread for the Sacrament, as much as is neceſſary, is ſet down. The Pontifician hath no reaſon, if he conſiders himſelf, to urge all particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about the Sacraments, ſince he accounts them ſo neceſſary: would God pinch that which is neceſſary under ſo many contingences, which he
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:40740:292"/> doth not ordinarily provide againſt? Therefore either they are not neceſſary; and then why are they inſiſted in? Or if neceſſary; yet not in all the ſeverall circumſtances: for then under how many accidentalities ſhould ſalvation be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</p>
            <p>He ſays then, he could add many more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to the former kind <hi>no leſſe neceſſary to be decided.</hi> If no more neceſſary, it is not like to trouble us. <hi>Or if neceſſary, they ſhould be decida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by plain Scripture.</hi> Yes, if neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>And then your Doctors could not jarr about them.</hi> This I deny, and he had better have taken our grant, that thoſe of this ſort are not plainly ſet down in Scripture, unleſſe he had proved it more ſtrongely than by our differences. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to differ in plain things: but we need not. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, St. <hi>Mark</hi> the 6. 53. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this is retorted. Many things might be named which were in the opinion of ſome Pontificians <hi>no leſſe neceſſary to be decided,</hi> than the point of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſin, the immaculate conception of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, the point of Reſidence and of Biſhops whether by Divine right; and yet are they not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Trent Council: no nor thoſe neither poſitively. But it may be they are not neceſſary: for if neceſſary <hi>they ſhould be decidable</hi> by <hi>plain</hi> Decree of Council: and <hi>then the Doctors could</hi> not jarr about them. But to give a further check to this unreaſonable exacting of ſuch particularities to be plainly decided by Scripture: let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider generally how little was affirmatively defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and clearly in the Council of Trent. Yea, for further inſtance, are theſe ſeverals which he hath pointed at more neceſſary to be decided than the point of Indulgences, which was the main point
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:40740:292"/> which occaſioned the diviſions of the Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently? And yet was not this ſufficiently han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled: yea, as the Author of the Hiſtory ſays, the Proteſtants complained that the Synod had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it over without clearing any doubt or deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any Controverſie. If they could not or would not, how ſhall we be bound under pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take our infallible and certain guidance from them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ecce iterum Criſpinus— ſome of you will hove no words at all neceſſary to the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſm, ſome will have ſuch kinds of words, and others, words very different from them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> He makes our differences not onely by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but for ought I ſee by fiction alſo: for I know none that would have no words, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in ſubſtance, or if they would; let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for themſelves. The eſſentiall form of words as to Baptiſm is as plainly ſet down as can be by words in Scripture, in the 28 of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And if any differ from this form then my Adverſaries argument was nought, whereby he would prove things not to be plainly ſet down; becauſe there were differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about them; for what can be more plainly ſet down than the form of Baptiſme? and yet he talks of differences thereabout. In the third and fourth Paragr. he proſecutes the ſame impertinencies to the queſtion in hand. And untill he proves all the points he doth inſtance in to be ſuch as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation in the ſame punctualities, I have nothing to do but to deny them to be ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which <hi>in formalitatibus,</hi> there is no ſalvation. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi eadem ratio eadem lex.</hi> According to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their uſe is the proportion of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in Scripture.</p>
            <pb n="670" facs="tcp:40740:293"/>
            <p>As for ſuch things as <hi>are of ſtrict neceſſity to certain men of certain ſtates and degrees in the Church.</hi> It goes upon a falſe ſuppoſition, that what is of ſtrict neceſſity to certain men of certain ſtates and degrees in the Church, ſhould be of ſtrict ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſalvation: nothing is of ſtrict neceſſity to ſalvation but that which is neceſſary to all unto ſalvation. Now it is not neceſſary to all unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to know what is of ſtrict neceſſity to ſome certain men of certain ſtates and degree. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, little in reaſon can be ſaid to be of ſtrict neceſſity to ſome certain men of certain degrees and ſtates in the Church; firſt, becauſe many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have diverſified theſe uſages, and ſecondly, becauſe no generall Council have deſcended to the binding of all abſolutely thereunto, nay, indeed not to the propoſing of them.</p>
            <p>And as for the forme of ordaining <hi>Biſhops in words or actions,</hi> the way in our Church is as full according to proportion in Scripture as any other, and our Biſhops have been alſo Canonically ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by three Biſhops, notwithſtanding the ſlanders againſt it: and let them prove, that what is in this caſe appointed in Councils is more neceſſary than what is done in our conſecration, or elſe they do nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They muſt alſo know whether they can lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit women to baptize at all, or baptize in neceſſity only, and not out of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, it is plain in Scripture that no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did baptize. Secondly, that baptizing and teaching are committed to the ſame perſons, as before, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. Now women are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to teach by St <hi>Paul,</hi> therefore may they not baptize. Thirdly, how can mans authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which God hath reſtrained, ſo as to make
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:40740:293"/> it neceſſary to ſalvation that this allowance ſhould be made, and alſo that all ſhould know it? And fourthly, it is yet to be proved whether there be ſuch abſolute neceſſity of baptiſm, as to diſpenſe herein in caſe of neceſſity, ſince St. <hi>Thomas</hi> was of opinion, as was urged in the Trent Council, that before Chriſt, children were ſaved by the faith of the Parents, and without the Sacrament; as it muſt be there meant, p. 239. of the Hiſtory. I know ſome ſpeak favorably in this point, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it ſhould ſo be done, but as not annulling it when done: but my Adverſary ſhould firſt have made the <hi>Subſtratum</hi> ſound and good, namely, the abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation. For if we ſhould be ruled by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in this matter, then we ſhould be ruled by him in all points: which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will not ſtand to; for they withſtand him in more particulars than we, as hath been noted by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> And beſides, his authority we might confront with <hi>Tertullian's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whether they may permit women or Lay-men to bleſſe the bread and diſtribute the Sacrament, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt ſaid, do this all, not plainly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing how far theſe his words extended themſelves.</hi> Surely my Adverſary intended me rather good meaſure, than good weight in ſuch argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, one would think, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this queſtion, if any, in the firſt Ep. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. Where he ſaies of Miniſters in general, that they are the Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of God. And then is this their bleſſing or diſtributing, if it might be allowed, neceſſary to ſalvation? And for his argument, it is improperly produced; for it is ſpoken to them not as Officers of the Church in adminiſtring, but as members of the Church in receiving: and this might he have taken notice of
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:40740:294"/> if he would have quoted the text intirely: for it is ſaid, Do this in remembrance of me, St. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.19. This belongs to every one in the act of participation. And then again, as he leaves out fomething not for him, ſo he adds ſomewhat which ſhould be for him, for he reads it <hi>do this all,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>all</hi> is not in the Evangeliſts; nor in the firſt Ep. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Again, if it be uncertain whether our Savior meant this for women and Laiques, <hi>do this all,</hi> then ſince by theſe words they would urge Chriſts inſtitution of the Sacrifice, Laymen and women ſhould have the higheſt, or might have (if the Church pleaſed) the higheſt dignity in their account in the Church; and that is <hi>conficere cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chriſti.</hi> And then the ſtory of Pope <hi>Joan</hi> ſhould be accounted of by them as more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If ſhe might do the office of a Prieſt, ſhe might alſo do the office of a Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether lawfull miſſion of Prieſts can be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Laymen or no.</hi> What? And muſt all we upon neceſſity of ſalvation know infallibly this, whether this Prieſt was ſent by a Layman? though a Layman hath not, nor can have, any authority to ſend, and the Roman in this gives more liberty to Laymen than the Scripture or our Churches, yet is it neceſſary for every one to ſalvation to know whether ſuch an one which doth the offices of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is legally ſent or not? Muſt every Layman examine his Commiſſion? And our Saviors inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein is our rule, who gave power to others by that authority which he had received from his Father, as St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Authoritate mihi commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> all authority is given me in Heaven and on earth, goe ye therfore. Now Laymen have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and therefore they cannot give any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according to the rule alſo.</p>
            <pb n="673" facs="tcp:40740:294"/>
            <p>And <hi>what kind of ordination is neceſſary for their function,</hi> and <hi>what commiſſion is neceſſary for their lawfull miſſions,</hi> and alſo <hi>what power to make</hi> (that is to conſecrate) <hi>and adminiſter Sacraments;</hi> theſe are <hi>plainly</hi> enough <hi>ſet down in Scripture,</hi> if the Roman Church had not diſturbed the clear waters for the chief Fiſher; and if not, the Church by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive law cannot appoint that which is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. All things that are of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right are not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation: to be ſure then what is not of Divine but poſitive right, as the Romans have alſo diſtinguiſhed, is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And therefore whereas he ſays, <hi>there are endles Controverſies about them,</hi> I am of his opinion in my ſenſe of the words; for they are to no end amongſt thoſe who have a ſober mind to be directed in them by Scripture; at leaſt they are to no end, as in order to our diſpute; becauſe they come not within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation. It may be neceſſary to know how theſe are to be ordered, that they may be ordered rightly: but this is not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation: yea again, if theſe things were left to the Church, we muſt take the order before the Councils: otherwiſe the Church before the time of Councils had wanted that which was neceſſary: and therefore indeed are they not neceſſary: or elſe God had been wanting to them in neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>A third ſort of things neceſſary not plainly ſet down, as he thinks, we have in his fourth number.<note place="margin">Num 4.</note> 
               <hi>All being obliged to ſerve God in a true Church,</hi> &amp;c. This is ambiguouſly delivered: either as <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> being in a true Church they are obliged to ſerve God in it; or are bound to finde out the true Church, and then to ſerve God in it. Now
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:40740:295"/> though both belong to our duty, yet both are not equally neceſſary: becauſe it is poſſible in that which is not a true Church (if ſo many things be neceſſary to a true Church as they would have) ſalvation may be had by ſimple ignorance and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall repentance. And I hope ſome were ſaved before a Church, with all the integrants of a true Church, was framed. But in a true Church no man can be ſaved without ſerving of God. The Church of the Donatiſts was not accounted, by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> nor my Adverſary, a true Church, yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not deny but ſome might be ſaved in it. Now this is underſtood by my Adverſary in the latter way, namely that every one is bound to finde out the true Church and to ſerve God in it, for ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having a lawfull ſucceſſion of true Paſtors true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained themſelves, and truely ordaining the Prieſts, who muſt be known to adminiſter true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in their true matter and forme, Preaching alſo the word of God by lawfull miſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now me thinks the Romans with their mountains ſhould have relation to <hi>Montanus</hi> who fanſied that the <hi>Paraclet</hi> did by priviledge come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to make up what was wanting to ſalvation, by inſpiration. For we muſt have infallible notes of a Church, which the word of God in Scripture hath not appointed to us. And we muſt have things neceſſary to ſalvation, which the Scripture hath not made neceſſary: yet they muſt be neceſſary to ſalvation, for their uſe. Certainly as he gives well the cogniſance of a good man, ſo may we alſo make uſe of it for a good Chriſtian, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we ought not to judge honeſt men by their performances but by their purpoſe:
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:40740:295"/> ſo we ought to eſteem good Chriſtians not by their happineſſe to finde, but by their purpoſe to finde out the true Church; which cannot reaſonably be done by a lawfull ſuceſſion. Firſt, becauſe this is accidentall, not as to ſalvation onely, but as to a true Church: and therefore can be no certain and univerſall rule: for how came the firſt Church, which was originall to the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendants, to be a true Church? yea ſecondly, how will the true Church be a true Church, according to their principles in the time of Antichriſt, when there is not like to be, according to their profeſſion, almoſt any face of a Church? How ſhall it then be diſcerned by a lawfull ſucceſſion of Paſtors. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this cannot be characteriſticall of the Roman Church (which they would have to be the onely true Church) becauſe the Greek Church may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this priviledge alſo. Yea, fourthly, it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a falſe Church may ſo fairly plead a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſion (as the Church of the Donatiſts who had alſo Biſhops) as to thoſe who ſhould come a long while after them, that it could not be eaſily diſcerned by common people: and therefore this is not the way ſo plain and direct <hi>as that fools can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err.</hi> Yea, fifthly, we are not to diſcern true Doctrine by the perſons, but the perſons by the Doctrine, according to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as before: and therefore if true Doctrine be not proved by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as it cannot be, becauſe then it ſhould be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the perſon) we cannot conclude a true Church by the ſucceſſion; ſince all ſober men will rather argue thus; that is a true Church which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth true Doctrine, than that Church profeſſeth true Doctrine, becauſe it hath a true ſucceſſion of Paſtors. Yea, ſixthly, did my Adverſary mean what he ſaid of a particular Church, or of the
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:40740:296"/> univerſall Church? Not of a particular Church ſure; for that cannot be the way and Judge of all Chriſtians, as he intended: But then of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Catholick Church. Well then, he muſt mean that that is the true Catholick Church which hath a <hi>lawfull ſucceſſion of Paſtors,</hi> namely, of Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is by them called ſignantly the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of the Church: This muſt be his meaning in reaſon, becauſe the lawfull ſucceſſion of Paſtors in particular Churches is, by my Adverſary, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for themſelves; but not for the Catholick Church, which can conſiſt without thoſe parts which are not true (and therefore no parts.) And this is like to be his meaning by his opinion. So then the Roman Church he would have here by the premiſſes to be the true Church, as being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have a lawfull ſucceſſion of Paſtors, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> But how ſhall we give up our ſelves in abſolute obedience to the guidance of the Roman Church, if this were an infallible and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive mark of the true Church, that it hath a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſion of Paſtors? For no man can have ſo much as a morall certitude that there hath been in <hi>Rome</hi> from St. <hi>Peter</hi> an interrupted lawfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Paſtors, much leſſe can he have a Divine perſwaſion thereof. For firſt, it can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Scripture that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome.</hi> I do not deny it that he was ever there; but it is no object of faith. And the Romaniſts are ſhrewdly put to it for a proof, when, to prove it, they would interpret <hi>Babylon,</hi> from which St. <hi>Peter</hi> writes, to be <hi>Rome.</hi> But then Secondly, St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould rather have derived the Priviledge of univerſall juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and infallible direction to <hi>Antioch,</hi> as is abſerved, where he ſate firſt ſeven years, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi> ſets it down, and where Chriſtians had their
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:40740:296"/> name. Thirdly, it is a great queſtion upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, who ſucceeded St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Carranza</hi> cannot determine it. Fourthly, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was appointed rather for the Jews than for the Gentiles: and therefore the Trent Council in their comminations do very well to put St. <hi>Paul</hi> with St. <hi>Peter;</hi> for indeed St <hi>Paul</hi> was the Doctor of the Gentiles. Yea, fifthly, for ſix hundred years together there was no Paſtors at <hi>Rome</hi> in their ſenſe, not Paſtor of the univerſall Church, as appears by <hi>Gregory's</hi> proteſtation againſt <hi>John of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> who would arrogate and uſurp univerſall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>
            <p>And therefore there was not alwyes in the Church, in my Adverſaries ſenſe, a lawfull ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Paſtors; becauſe there was not Paſtors in his ſenſe: and ſo by his argument, there ſhould not have been a Catholick Church for that time. Yea, Sixthly and laſtly, how can we be aſcertained, by certitude of faith, that there was ever a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſion of Biſhops in <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe we are not certain, in that kind of certainty to be ſure, nor indeed in any other, that the Popes were true Biſhops or true Prieſts, or true Chriſtians, becauſe their principles bring it into queſtion by the uncertainty of the qualifications of thoſe who were to make them Chriſtians by Baptiſm, or Prieſts by orders, or Biſhops by conſecration? And alſo ſecondly, becauſe ſome, as it is known by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, have got into the ſea by <hi>Simonie;</hi> which makes it diſputable even amongſt themſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it did not <hi>ex vi Criminis</hi> make them no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. And the thirtieth Canon of the Apoſtles (which they acknowledge as binding too) injoins, that ſuch as get their dignity by money ſhould be put out. Yea, thirdly, when there were Antipapes
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:40740:297"/> how could the Common people by aſſurance of faith know which was the right? For though they ſay, that he is to be accounted the right whom the Council doth accept; yet is it a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can infallibly judge in the caſe; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no certainty of faith. And then there is not always a Council; and how can the Council be called without a true Pope? If they may, then is not the Pope eſſentiall to the infallibility of the Church.</p>
            <p>This is anſwer enough to what he ſays about his <hi>lawfull ſucceſſion of true</hi> Paſtors; that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends hereunto is collaterally anſwered here; more particularly before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on, It is neceſſary to the ſalvation of every man to believe and do ſome things, and not to do ſome other things not plainly ſet down in Scripture.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo neceſſary as it is not to beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſo often. This propoſition doth indeed plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict our propoſition, but doth not prove it to be falſe, unleſſe it by it ſelf did evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be true. Therefore it is enough for me to deny it, being the Reſpondent. But we ſee by the way, that thoſe who make the Church its infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility their firſt principle, are apt to make all it ſays to be as clear as the firſt principles of Sciences. He that believes, and does according to Scripture, is ſurer of ſalvation than all the Church can make him. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as <hi>Ignatius's</hi> phraſe is, He that goes by the rule is ſafe; he that goes by Scripture in faith and obedience goes by the rule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Now God hath propoſed the Scripture as our rule, by <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> confeſſion in the beginning of his Controverſies, as before. And if it be not a compleat rule, then indeed is it not a rule; for it
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:40740:297"/> comes ſhort of a rule; and this will not ſerve <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin's</hi> uſe; becauſe then they whom he diſputes againſt might have urged their revelations beſide the rule, though not againſt it, as the Pontificians are pleaſed to diſtinguiſh. And as for point of faith, we have (beſides what teſtimonies out of the Fathers for this I have given before) the plain authority of St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his 4 <hi>Cat. p.</hi> 85. <hi>Edit.

               </gap>. Concerning things Divine and the holy Myſteries of faith, there ought not to be delivered any thing without the Divine Scriptures. And therefore in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he underſtands by traditions the ſum of thoſe things that were taken out of Scripture, as in the 5. <hi>Cat. p.</hi> 117. And ſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Praeſ. cap.</hi> 13. His <hi>Regula fidei,</hi> is a ſum of main points of Doctrine taken out of Scripture. And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this rule he ſayes, <hi>Adverſus Regulam nihil ſcire, omnia ſcire eſt.</hi> And ſo <hi>Irenaeus</hi> alſo means tradition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in ſeverall places.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Baſill,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> are quoted by the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians in the Trent Council, for holding that the Chriſtian faith is contained partly in the Scriptures and partly in traditions. But for theſe Fathers (if their conſent did ground infallible aſſent) are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſ-underſtood or elſe are contradictory to themſelves? and therefore we cannot rely upon them; becauſe one part of the contradiction muſt be falſe. As for St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I have formerly quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for holding, that all things neceſſary to faith and manners are amongſt thoſe things which are plainly contained in Scripture. And St. <hi>Baſill</hi> I have produced too. And as for <hi>Cyprian,</hi> we will quote him for the other part, namely, of
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:40740:298"/> action (though we might alſo name him for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the rule in things of faith; for he makes his proofs from Scripture.) In his ſecond <hi>B.</hi> of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, third Epiſtle, he hath theſe words, <hi>Quare ſi ſolus Chriſtus audiendus eſt, non debemus attendere quid aliquis ante nos faciendum putaverit, ſed quid qui ante omnes eſt Chriſtus prior fecerit. Neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim hominis Conſuetudinem ſequi oportet, ſed Dei veritatem.</hi> Wherein he oppoſeth the truth of God to whatſoever cuſtom. And the truth of God he underſtands to be of the word written; for there he proves all about the Cup in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be mingled with Wine and Water, out of Scripture, which proves however he took Scripture to be our rule in Agents.</p>
            <p>Yea, alſo this point was agitated by <hi>Marina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in the Trent Council: where he delivered his opinion,<note place="margin">P. 151. z.</note> that the Fathers did not make Tradition to be equall to Scripture; and therefore was he reprehended in the Council by Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> for not allowing, that Articles of faith are divided into two kinds: <hi>ſome publiſhed by writing: others commanded to be communicated by voice.</hi> And can any ſober man imagin that God ſhould by his ſpirit give order for the writing of the Myſtery of the Goſpell, and yet ſhould alſo give order by his Spirit that ſomewhat ſhould not be written, but kept in Myſtery for orall tradition, and yet ſhould be as much neceſſary as that which is written? —<hi>credat Judaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every one is to believe ſome things diſtinctly. Now which theſe things be, or how many, Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Let this be taken for an antecedent: will it be concluced from hence, that therefore all things neceſſary are not plainly ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:40740:298"/> For though we have not the formall and materiall number of things diſtinctly to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: yet all that is diſtinctly to be believed may be plainly ſet down there. And therefore if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, we believe ſufficiently. Therefore if he takes the terme, <hi>[diſtinctly]</hi> in this ſenſe, that we muſt neceſſarily know, that this is one of the points neceſſary to be believed, we deny it, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very point that is neceſſary: although we may ſay ſo of ſome, as that Jeſus is the Chriſt; becauſe in Scripture ſalvation is denied any other way, as, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.12. If he takes the term as ſignifying that ſome things are actually and explicitly to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we grant it; but the conſequence ſo is not valid. Secondly, this returnes upon them, and therefore ſhould they not have moved this ſtone. For where have they ſet down a liſt of all thoſe things which by every of them are neceſſary to be believed <hi>diſtinctly</hi> in contradiſtinction to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith? And if they ſay, that they are ready diſtinctly to believe whatſoever is propoſed by the Church: ſo we ſay, that we are alſo ready to believe whatſoever ſhall be ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of Scripture. And ſure we have as good cauſe for an implicit faith as to Scripture; as they have as to the Church. And if Mr. <hi>Knot's</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be the ſenſe of the Roman Church, there is but one fundamentall point, of them actually and diſtinctly to be believed, <hi>in which are compriſed all points by us taught to be neceſſary to ſalvation, in theſe words, we are obliged under pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to believe whatſoever the Catholick viſible Church of Chriſt propoſeth as revealed by Almighty God. If any be of another mind, all Catholicks denounce him to be no Catholick.</hi> So he. And therefore why do they urge a particular and Inventory of all
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:40740:299"/> points diſtinctly to be believed, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with one Generall? If the Church muſt be proved by Scripture, as formerly we have ſhewed, and according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> then one generall comprehenſive point might more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſufficient for us, and that is this, we <hi>are obliged under pain of damnation to believe</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever plainly appeares to be revealed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in Scripture. But yet we do not content our ſelves thus; for we ſay all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary are diſtinctly to be believed; and they may diſtinctly be believed, becauſe they are plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; more plainly than the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, at leaſt the Trent Council. And he that ſays he is bound to believe all that is contained in Scripture, when clearly propoſed to him as ſuch, by conſequent is ready to embrace all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe they are plainly delivered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed is our opinion more agreeable to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct account of what is to be expreſſely believed than theirs, becauſe we make a diſtinction in point of credibility by the matter; ſaying, that ſome things are plainly propoſed, becauſe neceſſary to be believed, though all things are neceſſary to be believed when plainly propoſed. The former ſort whereof requires abſolute belief; the latter conditionate to the competent appearance of them to be ſuch as God hath ſhewed to come from him by revelation.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some things are neither <hi>de fide,</hi> nor <hi>de verbo fidei;</hi> as that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Biſhop of the Church. Some things are <hi>de verbo fidei,</hi> yet not <hi>de fide,</hi> in propriety of phraſe, as neceſſary in the matter; as namely hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall truths, as that Jeſus rode to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Some things are <hi>de verbo fidei</hi> and <hi>de fide</hi> alſo, as that Jeſus is the Chriſt, that whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſhall be ſaved. The queſtion now betwixt us is of the laſt kind, whether Scripture with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent clearneſſe ſets down all thoſe things which are <hi>de fide</hi> in this ſenſe. So that my Adverſary was to prove that theſe particulars are ſo neceſſary to be believed, that no man who doth not believe them <hi>diſtinctly</hi> can be ſaved. And while he ſaith ſo, that they are ſuch, and doth not prove them, we need ſay no more than that he doth not prove them. <hi>Aſſerentis eſt probare.</hi> And I am not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto words but Arguments. Yet ſecondly, theſe are ſufficiently knowable by Scripture, the firſt by the equity of the fourth Commandement, and the intimations thereof in the new Teſtament. The ſecond by God's own inſtitution in ſtate of innocency, and by the firſt <hi>Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. But for fornication, let every man have his own wife, <gap reason="foreign">

And alſo they will incurre the danger of being engaged to anſwer for that Pope, who as before, gave liberty to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wife.

If the law of God hath not made theſe caſes of Mariage as plain as is neceſſary for thoſe who are not ſo ſtudious to know the utmoſt of their liberty, as to reſolve a negative of practice upon any appearance to the contrary, then the law of God muſt as clearly, as to exclude doubt, ſhew unto us that infallible directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereby we may come exactly to the knowledge of what is to be done herein.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> My Adverſary here was very bold, to bring into equall compare the books of <hi>Judith</hi> and <hi>Tobit</hi> with the book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> one book of the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi> as to the Autopiſty thereof. But the Jews who ſay that every letter of Scripture makes a mountain of ſenſe, could ſee more in the book of <hi>Numbers</hi> than in thoſe Apocryphal books. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would reſolve the acceptance of one and the refuſall of the other into a reaſon of both, and aſk why the Jew acknowledged the book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> not the other, we muſt find that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the one and the diſacceptance of the other cannot fall into the account of the Jewiſh Church its authority; becauſe the queſtion will rebound why the Jewiſh Church did authorize one and not the other. And therefore my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary gets nothing by this objection: for the Church cannot be the reaſon of the approbation of the one and the preterition of the other; becauſe this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made by the Church muſt be determined by a judicious act upon good cauſe. For do they dream that the Church hath an arbitrary power to receive one book, and to expunge another out of the Canon? Did they not excerciſe in it a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion? Now he that diſcernes ſees betwixt two, and ſees cauſe why one ſhould be taken the other left. Every elective act caſts the ballance upon more weight. And therefore muſt we not take the recenſion of books canonicall from the power of the Church. And then again ſecondly, this availes not the Roman Church; becauſe, if the diſcerning of books canonicall did auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratorically depend upon the Church its declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet as it is noted, not upon a particular Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And therefore, they ſaw nothing in them for their reception, and yet did in others. And if it belongs to the Church authoritatively to declare what books are Canonicall; yet cannot the Church have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to declare more than the Apoſtles conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; if they take thoſe Canons to be Canons of the Apoſtles: for otherwiſe they muſt challenge a power to the Church not only of declaring what is Canonicall, but alſo of making it ſuch; which is more than their great Doctors dare affirm. And if they will ſtill plead thoſe books Canonicall, let them anſwer it to St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and to the reſt, whom they think not to have differed from the Church, and yet have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them in this.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, they muſt infallibly ſhew that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry verſe in which I find this point is not thruſt in amongſt other true parts of Scripture, or ſome word changing the ſenſe either thruſt in or left out in this verſe, and this they muſt know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</hi>

But for the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptednes of the text, if they will not believe me, let them believe <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as before, who denies any ſubſtantiall corruption: but then again, we are as ſure as they, for we have for it, all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the Church hath, if it be infallible, we have it. Again, the Scripture is corrupted, or not? If
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:40740:301"/> ſo, then by the Roman Church or by ſome other. Not by the Roman Church, they will ſay: then by ſome other is it corrupted? If by any other, then firſt, how well have they been keepers of Canonicall truth? and how then ſhall we truſt them? Secondly, if corrupted, then how do they know that thoſe texts which are produced for them are not corrupted? If by the Church they know them not to be corrupted, this is the queſtion, which is to be proved, and therefore cannot yet prove it. For as they ſay we cannot know the Scripture to be infallible by the Scripture: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we know infallibly the Church to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible by the Church. Though it were infallible, yet this muſt be alſo known <hi>infallibly,</hi> according to my Adverſaries argument. Indeed; if the word of God did leave witneſſe to its infallibility, then we are ſatisfied: but, if the texts of Scripture be corrupted, how ſhall I be ſure whether thoſe they make uſe of be not corrupted? Therefore had they beſt for ever cloſe their mouths againſt any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Scripture; untill they can ſufficiently prove that the authority of the Church is <hi>principium primo primum</hi> in Divinity. For the teſtimony of the Church cannot exceed, of it ſelf, its <hi>genus.</hi> It can make no more than an high opinion; which comes ſhort of, and is too low for infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But then moreover, this objection is retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them. How can we be infallibly aſſured, that in the Decrees and Canons of Council there ſhould be no corruption, that one thing is not <hi>thruſt in,</hi> or ſomewhat <hi>left out;</hi> ſince we know that there was a falſification of the Nicene Council, as before? Since they have corrupted paſſages of the Fathers, as before? Since ſome words of the Decrees of the Council of Trent were changed after the vote,
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:40740:302"/> as appear in the Hiſtory? So then in this reſpect, as in others, we may conclude, they have no reaſon to accuſe our way of uncertaintie: for we may be ſure of this, that no way is ſo full of uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as theirs. If the Scripture be true, they may be a Church; if falſe, they may be Heathens. What he ſays. <hi>Thirdly, after all this,</hi> &amp;c. hath in it no ſuch difficultie, as they imagin; for the words themſelves (incorrupted) do ſhew their own ſenſe, as being for the things neceſſary, ſpoken in a plain and <hi>common</hi> acception. And alſo their Decrees and Canons, as before, are to be ſure, more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to diverſitie of ſenſe, becauſe they were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, at leaſt ſome of them, for ſuch a capacitie. Neither; if ſome things be expreſſed <hi>figuratively,</hi> doth any ſuch perplexity ariſe; becauſe the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expreſſion doth not oppoſe the literall ſenſe ſo much as it doth ſometimes illuſtrate it. And this kind of ſpeech as to Sacraments, in regard of the relation betwixt the ſign and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is indeed naturall and proper. Though the manner of ſpeech be not proper ſimply; yet <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> as to Sacraments, it is proper. And my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary might have taken notice that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath noted, as before, that things darkly ſet down in one place, are to be compared with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places where they are delivered more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>And therefore that which follows about the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity in what ſenſe we muſt take the words, if we go <hi>by Scripture only,</hi> might very well have been ſpared. For, as we do not argue in Divinity from texts <hi>myſtically</hi> delivered, unleſſe the myſticalneſſe be rendred in Scripture: ſo we do not account thoſe texts, which are ambiguous, to be ſuch as to contain points neceſſary to ſalvation. Therefore
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:40740:302"/> is my Adverſary very wide in this diſcourſe, becauſe it goeth upon a ſuppoſition, that every text is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be underſtood and infallibly in the ſenſe thereof. This can be denied freely without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement to our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Might we not therefore ſmile at that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as if we were bound <hi>infallibly to know the ſecret free will of God,</hi> for which we <hi>muſt have a revelation,</hi> or elſe our cauſe ſhould be loſt? What is this to the contradiction of us, unleſſe we were either obliged to know infallibly all ſenſes of all texts, or unleſſe thoſe texts, which contain points neceſſary were ſo doubtfull in the ſenſe thereof. We deny both. The Scripture is in the ſenſe. And as to points neceſſary, the revelation is in the words? no need of a revelation of the ſenſe after the revelation of the words, becauſe the ſenſe is revealed in the words. As if when our Savior ſaith, <hi>This is eternall life to know thee the onely true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we muſt yet have an eternall labor to find out diſtinctly in what ſenſe we muſt take plain neceſſary truths. As if when our Savior commands us to <hi>repent and believe,</hi> we had need of another revelation or an infallible Judge to tell us in what ſenſe we muſt take the words. As if when our Saviour ſays, that he hath <hi>revealed theſe things to babes,</hi> we muſt go to the Holy Father of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Fathers of a Councill for an uncontrolable expoſition of <hi>theſe things.</hi> If then by the <hi>ſecret free will of God,</hi> Gods purpoſes of binding us in our obedience; that, as to things neceſſary, is revealed in the termes. His <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> as they ſpeak, as to theſe things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, is plainly delivered; and otherwiſe the expreſſion were not good, if we needed another revelation of the ſenſe. Indeed the <hi>voluntas bene
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:40740:303"/> placiti,</hi> as to his actions, that needs a revelation; but what is this to our purpoſe? The former <hi>will,</hi> how he would expreſſe himſelf, was <hi>free</hi> to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did reveal himſelf in ſuch writings: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was determined by the plain ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, as to thoſe matters of faith. And where do they <hi>find this revelation in Scripture,</hi> that we muſt go to the Church for a revelation of the ſenſe of difficult texts? Yea, of thoſe texts which concern the Church? How ſhall we know whether thoſe texts be rightly interpreted, and know it infallibly? Not by the Church: For the queſtion is of the Church. Not by a revelation made to particular perſons: for then we might have a revelation of other texts in the ſenſe of them. Therefore muſt they ſay they are plain. And if ſo, then ſo may other texts be, eſpecially ſuch as reſpect neceſſity to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Therefore when we have tried all ways, as to faith we muſt center in Scripture. And let them think upon that of Chriſt to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>What he ſays <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I have little to ſay to. The authorites of <hi>Sanctius</hi> and <hi>Sharpius,</hi> which he produceth, are more for my advantage than his. For my Adverſary confeſſeth, that <hi>learned San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctius</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>that holy Scripture in thoſe things which are neceſſary, is clear.</hi> Secondly, as for the <hi>nineteen rules</hi> which he gives, <hi>as neceſſary to the knowledge thereof;</hi> this may reſpect other texts of Scripture which do not contemn neceſſary points. Thirdly, if thoſe rules be intended as to the knowledge of what is neceſſary to ſalvation, (and not to the knowledge of Scripture in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) yet the difficulty muſt not be great even by thoſe rules: for how then can Scripture be clear,
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:40740:303"/> as to things neceſſary? Yea, alſo St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives rules for the underſtanding of Scripture, and yet holds, that Scripture, as to faith and manners, plainly delivers things neceſſary, as before. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it neceſſary for our cauſe to exclude the uſe of means for the underſtanding of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture even in things neceſſary. It is ſufficient to us, that by the uſe of means, thoſe texts are ſo plain as that we have no need of an external infallible Judge. But we can admit with <hi>Sharpius</hi> the means he names, <hi>to know originall Languages, to diſcuſſe the words, Phraſes and Ebraiſms, to confer the places which are like and unlike to one another;</hi> as to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Scripture, <hi>de communi;</hi> and they are neceſſary: but he cannot mean theſe rules to be neceſſary for the underſtanding of every truth in Scripture. And therefore, if his authority were ſufficient, yet cannot this he ſays be effectuall to prove a neceſſity of all theſe means, as to the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the ſenſe of thoſe texts wherein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truths are laid down. That Jeſus is the Chriſt; that whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved; that there is a neceſſity of good works, are truths ſo plain, as he that cannot uſe thoſe means, may plainly diſcern: and therefore need we not the help of thoſe rules, as <hi>to produce infallibility.</hi> To be even then with my Adverſary for theſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we may alſo urge as the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Collen,</hi> who as before reformed his Church by the rule of Scripture, ſo alſo the Cardinall of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who in the Trent Council ſaid, <hi>It was better to take for our ground the Scripture, whence true Theology is taken; than the ſubtilties of Philoſophy which the Schools have uſed.</hi> Hiſt. Trent Counc. <hi>Pag.</hi> 197. 8. And add hereunto the uncertainties of the ſenſe of a Council, as appears by conteſt of <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Viga,</hi> Hiſt. Tr. Counc. 216.</p>
            <pb n="692" facs="tcp:40740:304"/>
            <p>As for the <hi>ſaying of that ſo much eſteemed</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth, which he adds, <hi>fifthly,</hi> namely, <hi>no more certain ſign that a point is not evident, than when ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt &amp; underſtanding and indifferent men, &amp; ſuch as give themſelves liberty of judgment after mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the matter, do differ about.</hi> Unto which he ſubſumes, <hi>About how many points do you and your Brethren differ, which I have in this chap. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be points</hi> mainly <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation, which according to this rule of knowing what is evident, what not, are evidently not ſet down plainly in Scripture?</hi> What comes this to, but a confuſion? For Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> gives us the <hi>Maxim,</hi> and my Adverſary makes the aſſumption upon preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he hath proved many things to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered about which he ſaith he hath <hi>ſhewed to be neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> By Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> rule thoſe points ſhould not be neceſſary, becauſe we differ about them. But my Adverſary would fain prove, it may be, that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> rule is falſe. If it be falſe, how can he uſe it againſt me? If it be not falſe, then it concludes more againſt him, however, till he proves our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to be about neceſſaries, his diſcourſe hath neither forme; nor truth, upon his part.</p>
            <p>Some twelve lines of this number he imploys in repetitions, and references to the fourth chap. His repetitions have been anſwered in the matter, his References are referred to their place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 6.</note>That which follows concerning texts which he thinks are for him, that <hi>the very reading of them ſheweth them to be no leſſe plain and clear to this purpoſe than thoſe places which you cry out to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident for the proof of every point which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation,</hi> me thinks doth ſomewhat enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair upon what he had ſaid before, that we could
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:40740:304"/> not underſtand <hi>God's free will</hi> how to mean his own words <hi>without a revelation.</hi> For now thoſe texts, which they fanſie for them, by the very reading of them, ſhew themſelves to be as clear as thoſe which <hi>we cry out to be ſo evident;</hi> we ſay ſo plain. So then ſome degree of clearneſs there may be in words without a revelation of the ſenſe; ſince God hath no mentall reſervation. And if they grant ſome clearneſſe, as it is neceſſary they muſt for thoſe texts which concern the Church, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there may be more than they grant. Secondly, will they ſay, that thoſe texts, they urge for the Church, are as clear for the Roman Church in point of infallibility, as this propoſition is, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believes ſhall be ſaved? Dare they ſay it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? We can prove the contrary by their own argument; that about which there is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is not ſo clear: there is more difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the texts for the Church; therefore thoſe not ſo clear. Therefore alſo let them no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our differences: for our differences from them prove well that their way is not plain, and their differences amongſt themſelves prove better that their way is not plain. And our differences amongſt our ſelves do prove onely that thoſe points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we differ are not plain; but do not prove that thoſe points that are neceſſary are not plain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in them we do not or need not to differ. Thirdly, are thoſe texts for them no more plain than our texts for things neceſſary to ſalvation? If not, then where is the ground of their infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For the texts are not clear for it: are they? If they be, then our texts for neceſſaries to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are, I hope, as clear, then what need of a Judge infallible? And why then do they not as well believe the points neceſſary to ſalvation upon
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:40740:305"/> account of Scripture as they do the point of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility? Well, but our texts being not clear ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently of themſelves, the authority of the Church adds clearneſſe: doth it? Yea, but this is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly affirmed, if they do ſay ſo, than they think of: for the judgement of the Church is more influxive into the clearneſſe of it as to us, than their authority. They firſt ſee the ſenſe of the texts, before they do declare it by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. For if this be the ſenſe becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it ſo, and they do not declare it to be the ſenſe, becauſe they ſee it diſcuſſively to be the ſenſe; then God, inſpiring the Pen-men of Scripture intended but the words of Scripture, and that the Church ſhould give us the ſoul, the ſenſe, the Kernell of Scripture. And why then did the Trent Councill make Scriptures the chief rule, as they ſay, of their proceedings, if they did not determine of points and actions by their diſcerning the mind of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to thoſe particulars? So then alſo, if their diſcerning of the ſenſe of Scripture was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to their definitions, then the Scripture is diſcernible in the ſenſe to us alſo. Fourthly, if thoſe texts, he names, be no clearer than thoſe we ſay which are neceſſary to ſalvation; then let them never endeavour by Scripture to perſwade any to their Religion. For if the texts be no clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for the Church, than points in Scripture are, as to neceſſity of ſalvation, then ſurely the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is equall on both ſides; and then there is by Scripture no neceſſity clear of an infallible Judge.</p>
            <p>But he prefers his texts in clearneſſe to ours in the following words. <hi>And I am ſure you can bring no ſuch evident texts for all, yea, or for any of theſe points which I have already ſaid in this
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:40740:305"/> ch. not to be evidently ſet down in Scripture though they be of prime neceſſity, as others alſo which I will by and by add.</hi> The uſe of this to me is this, to ſay that the ſame was ſaid before, yet alſo we can note that he ſhould have preferred the clearneſſe of thoſe texts for the Church before the clearneſſe of thoſe points which we confeſſe to be neceſſary to ſalvation; but he prefers it before thoſe which we either deny or queſtion to be neceſſary. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſhould ſay this were a Sophiſters trick, I could not tell how to deny it. And yet alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſay, if thoſe texts which are for the Church are ſo plain, then <hi>a fortiori,</hi> thoſe texts which are for points neceſſary muſt be more plain; and my reaſon is this, becauſe theſe are neceſſary for the being of a Member of the Church inviſible, thoſe for the Church, onely neceſſary for the being of a Member of the Church viſible. Now there is a greater neceſſity of the former than there is of the latter: for as before, it is poſſible to be ſaved without the finding of a regular viſible Church; but it is not poſſible for any to be ſaved who is not a Member of the inviſible. Yea, again he doth not ſpeak according to the mind of Mr. <hi>Knot,</hi> in ſaying texts for the Church are ſo evident, for one of the qualities of the object of faith, ſhould be,<note place="margin">Ch. 6. againſt Dr. <hi>Pots.</hi>
               </note> according to him, that it is obſcure; that ſo it may be capable of the obedience of faith. But to end this, we onely note more the ſlavery of the Romaniſt; in that he is bound to be ſo diſ-ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to hold the texts of Scripture to be ſo clear only for the Church, which they interpret the Roman. But alſo herein they do not differ from all other ſects, which they ſo much upbraid, that texts for them are clear, if any other. And we have the benefit of it (whom he takes to be a Sect)
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:40740:306"/> till he ſhews the Contrary. But the Scripture doth <hi>far more clearly ſet down a Command to goe to the Church for our full inſtruction. So St.</hi> Paul <hi>was taught all things neceſſary for his knowledge by thoſe few words. (Acts the</hi> 9.6.) <hi>Goe into the City, and it ſhall be told thee what thou muſt doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And have they no better Arguments, St. <hi>Paul</hi> was commanded to go into the City, and there it ſhould be told him what he muſt do; therefore we muſt go to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> and there we ſhall know all things neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So then. As the Cardinall <hi>Richlieu</hi> was flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by a great ſervant of his, that God needed not to have extended his Providence to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er world; but he might have left that to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance of the Cardinall: ſo God needed not to have indited by his Spirit any more of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than only to lead us infallibly to the Church. Go to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and there <hi>it will be told</hi> us <hi>what muſt be done,</hi> in order to life everlaſting. Chriſt might have laid aſide the care of his Church; &amp; might have devolved that to his Vicar. If we would ſay any thing to ſuch a reaſoning, we might ſay, firſt, he ſhould have ſhewed us as fair a warrant for going to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to go to the City. Secondly, he was ſent into the City to know what was to be done; not <hi>known:</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> denies to have had his Doctrine from man. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11, 12. Thirdly, this direction he was to have from <hi>Ananias,</hi> was rather in order to his Function than to his ſalvation. Fourthly, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> was extroardinarily inſpired and indued with a power of Miracles for the reſtitution of his ſight. But is the Pope thus? Can he give the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Ananias</hi> did; Indeed he may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:40740:306"/> but can he give the Holy Ghoſt as <hi>Ananias</hi> did? At leaſt, can he give ſight? he can ſooner take it away. If we being blind ſhould take the guidance of ſuch a Prophet, he would lead us into <hi>Samaria,</hi> and not ſet bread before us.</p>
            <p>Indeed Pope <hi>Anacletus</hi> (according to <hi>Carranza</hi>) tels us in the end of his firſt Epiſtle, that <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did eſtabliſh this by the Command of our Lord and Savior, that greater and more difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ſhould be referred to the Apoſtolick ſea, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Chriſt did build his univerſall Church (u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſam Eccleſiam) when he ſaid tu es Petrus, &amp;c.</hi> But when theſe Epiſtles are proved genuine; and then binding in his own cauſe, and when the Pope (who hath the ſame power) ſhall have determined the difficult queſtion (which <hi>Carranza</hi> puts off) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and others, whether <hi>Anacletus</hi> was predeceſſor to <hi>Clement;</hi> and when it ſhall be made good that Chriſt gave to St. <hi>Peter</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall power over the univerſall Church, and not onely power over every Church, as to the reſt of the Apoſtles (as it was diſtinguiſhed in the Trent Council) and when they ſhall have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who ſays the Church was founded, not <hi>ſuper Petrum,</hi> but <hi>ſuper Petram, voce Domini;</hi> in the 8. <hi>Ep.</hi> of the 1. <hi>b.</hi> then we may be in greater neceſſity to ſay more to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all might ſee this City of the Church, he placed it on a mountain, whence all neceſſary points are delivered from a living Oracle ſpeaking ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, that no doubt can remain of the true ſenſe; or, if there be made any doubt of any thing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, this doubt will preſently be cleared by ſome new declaration authentically notified unto us by our Paſtors ond Doctors, which God gave us (as the
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:40740:307"/> Scripture ſaith) that we ſhould not be children wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wavering and carried about with the wind of falſe Doctrine with circumvention of error,</hi> We have put all in for weight: we ſhall anſwer now diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly. Firſt, as to the mountain; we muſt know what mountain this is upon which the City of the Church was built. Whether the mount <hi>Gerezzin,</hi> or whether is mount <hi>Eball,</hi> how ſhall we know? And which are the Samaritans and which the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſolymitans, how ſhall we diſcern? We muſt yet wander upon the Mountains to know which mountain is the right. Each will claim the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a <hi>living Oracle.</hi> Therefore if we were to take our reſolves of all <hi>neceſſary points</hi> from the Church, we were yet to ſeek which is the true Church. And ſo the prime neceſſary would be uncertain, namely, which ſhould be our infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Propounder and Reſolver of all neceſſary points. How ſhall we reſolve this capitall and cardinall Controverſie which is the right Church, the Mother and Miſtriſſe of all Churches? Yea, the queſtion is yet to be agitated and determined infallibly whether there is to be any ſuch, it is not yet proved, but my Adverſary here ſeems to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. Well; give it, not grant it in the <hi>theſis,</hi> that there is ſuch a Church. How ſhall it be made beyond all queſtion, that this or this is the Church for the <hi>Hypotheſis?</hi> Whether <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> or <hi>Allexandria,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> is the City of that Church how ſhall we be aſcertained infallibly? Muſt the City be built upon a hill in the letter? Then indeed there might be ſome diſcovery: and yet more Cities are ſo built, and therefore no certainty. And <hi>Rome</hi> hath too many hills to be a topicall argument that it is the ſeat of Chriſt: ſeven hills are rather topicall
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:40740:307"/> for Antichriſt, as in the revelation. Secondly, if the Church be as faſt to a place as the Heathen gods to their Temples, muſt the Church by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the place always have the ſame priviledges in the <hi>zenith?</hi> So then if the Roman Church was ſo faithfull, as that for a time, they did flow to it for direction in doubtfull caſes; muſt it always be as the Oracular Virgin? Will <hi>Caſſander</hi> believe it that <hi>Caſſandra</hi> was always ſo clear in her Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? What ſays <hi>Lycophron?</hi>

Is not the word of God an <hi>Oracle?</hi> Let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. Were not the Scriptures of the old Teſtament the Oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2.? To them were committed the Oracles of God. Have we not a generall command, <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony? If they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them, Eſ.</hi> 8.20. There is light in the Law and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony always: but there is not always light in them that would direct without or beſide them. But the word they will ſay is not a <hi>living Oracle,</hi> But the word is an Oracle, and it is a living word, as before in the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And the living God ſpeaks to us in this written Oracle. And therefore untill we ſee in this written Oracle, that we have and are bound to a <hi>living Oracle,</hi> my Adverſary ſays nothing. Thirdly, we deny, that his <hi>living Oracle</hi> ſuppoſed ſpeaks <hi>ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly; that no doubt can remain of the true ſenſe.</hi> This is ſufficiently declared before in the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:40740:308"/> decrees of the Council of Trent. So that indeed their living Oracle ſpeaks after the old ſort of the Heathen Oracles, as <hi>Loxias</hi> did, ſo as to preſerve truth in one ſenſe or other. Each party thought that the Oracle ſpake for him. As he to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes—Aut erit aut non</hi> they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one of a true prophecy, yea, theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Oracles have a true ſenſe in them, but we know not which. Well then alſo; as for <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary points</hi> we ſay fourthly, as before, that we have no need of <hi>a living</hi> Oracle, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks ſo plainly and ſo <hi>diſtinctly, that no doubt can</hi> juſtly <hi>remain of the true ſenſe.</hi> And what needs more, as to ſalvation? Yea alſo it ſpeaks plainly, and ſo diſtinctly unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other profitable points, as that <hi>no doubt can remain of the true ſenſe.</hi> And fifthly, whereas they ſay, <hi>or if there be made any doubt of any thing of importance, &amp;c.</hi> this new peice takes off from the old, and makes the rent worſe: for if the living Oracle ſpeaks ſo <hi>diſtinctly, that no doubt can remain of the true ſenſe,</hi> then what need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further proviſion for doubts emergents, as if they durſt not truſt their own principles. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if they can aſſoile all doubts that ſhall ariſe; why do they not? why, ſince the Trent Council, hath there been no other to explain the ſenſe of the former in ſeverall particulars? that which was never done and yet would be of ſuch uſe is moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputed for an impoſſibility; as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Pelagians. This would prove wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ignorance in the Church Repreſentative. And therefore cannot we be obliged to follow it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely: for it ſeems ſometimes it will not lead us. And if they ſay that we may well be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the infallible dejudication of the ſenſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:40740:308"/> terms; why do they then include in the caſe a <hi>thing of importance?</hi> Yea, and alſo we can then by their allowance ſay, we may be ſafely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of ſome points which are not of <hi>importance</hi> to ſalvation: and therefore are in a capacity good enough to give the negative to a Judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſixthly, neither can the doubt <hi>be preſently cleared by ſome new Declaration authentically no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified unto us by our Paſtors and Doctors.</hi> Not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, firſt, becauſe a Councill muſt be called which the Roman Church will be well advi- of before, and if it coſts them as much time to conſider of it and to diſpatch it as the Trent Council, this <hi>preſently</hi> will not come within for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and more. And if he ſays the preſent Pope can preſently deliver the ſenſe, and notify it <hi>authentically;</hi> then why ſays he it may be done by <hi>Paſtors and Doctors?</hi> Why doth he ſpeak in the number of plurality to the prejudice of the one Authoritative Paſtor? Well, it may be, he means Paſtors and Doctors, in common, can <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically</hi> notifie us the ſenſe; then private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors may be authentick, which ſpoils all; and is contrary to Jeſuit and Roman Catholicks (as they call themſelves) in generall: and to his own opinion, who placeth all authority and infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a Council confirmed by the Pope. For we are bound they ſay, to the ſenſe of the Decrees: then if private Doctors and Paſtors can authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally notifie us the ſenſe, then are we bound to them. Yea, and alſo why may not then our private Paſtors and Doctors declare to us the ſenſe of doubtfull texts, as well as theirs; and then why an infallible Judge? Yea, can private Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors authentically notifie us the ſenſe;
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:40740:309"/> and not the infallible Judge? If he can, why doth he not? If he will not, how ſhall we take him for our Guide? They have determined the words of their definitions, but have either not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined or determined not to determine the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and ſenſe: but that muſt be left for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſeventhly and laſtly, he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have not have produced theſe paſſages in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to thoſe texts. For God gave us <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors;</hi> then not onely one Paſtor of the Church, as the high Romaniſt accounts; who makes all others to be as his Curates in all the univerſall Church. Why then doth one arrogate that which in common is aſſigned to more? <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> thinks it unreaſonable, that the name of Biſhop, which is common to many, ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to one, though he denies not there the ſuperiority of one to the reſt of the Clergy: and my Adverſary would have the action of a Paſtor authenticall to be common to many, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the title others would have proper to one, and to be given to the reſt but analogically. This text then by my Adverſaries expoſition derogates from the ordinary and univerſall Paſtor, becauſe it alloweth his priviledge to many. But then again, he commits a fallacy of diviſion, in attributing the end to a part which is applied to the whole: for it is ſaid there, And he gave ſome Apoſtles; ſome Prophets; ſome Evangeliſts; ſome Paſtors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, the work of the Miniſtry. They are all given com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexively for that end, and he takes it diſtributive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of the laſt. As if all faith were to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the dictates of Paſtors and Teachers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:40740:309"/> the Church is built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief Corner ſtone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. Yea, and again, there is to be made a difference between the Paſtors and Doctors then and now, there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been then better gifts given to them than now, and they having been then nearer the fountain of Evangelicall truth than now: and therefore though the office is continued, it is not neceſſary, that when the Chriſtian Church hath been ſo long ſetled, there ſhould be ſuch perfection in the ſucceſſors. <hi>Diſtingue tempora,</hi> as the rule is.</p>
            <p>His ſeventh number might well have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:<note place="margin">Num. 7.</note> for he ſeems to charge me with not doing what in the eight number he ſays I go about to do. Only whereas he ſays for me, that the <hi>Scriptures taken by themſelves all alone do teach us with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility all things neceſſary to ſalvation:</hi> the terms may admit a diſtinction. If he takes the terms <hi>all alone</hi> ſo as to be underſtood contradiſtinctly to an infallible Judge, ſo we ſtand to them, if he takes them ſo as to exclude all uſe of Paſtors and Doctors, ſo are not we bound to them, we can in our opinion exclude the infallible Judge without excluſion to the direction of Paſtors and Teachers; which although not exempted from poſſibility of error, yet may alſo be conſulted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in texts ſufficiently plain. Beſides, as he ſtates the point for us, that <hi>the Scriptures taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all alone do teach us with infallibility all things neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> we can eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto, upon another diſtinction, which we, have in metaphyſick about the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that the unapprehenſiveneſſe of them doth more proceed from the weakneſſe of the faculty, than the nature
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:40740:310"/> of the things themſelves: ſo the Scriptures by themſelves alone do teach us with infallibility all things neceſſary; although we were not able to perceive infallibly the ſenſe of them. All things neceſſary yet are infallibly taught there; and therefore this ſerves to the evacuation of their <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum non ſcriptum;</hi> becauſe that this is not pretented for the clearing of Scripture, but for the ſupply of matter defective.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 8.</note>To come now to the diſcuſſion of the texts. <hi>And firſt, you preſſe the ſecond time that of St.</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Tim. 2.15, 16. And here he ſays, <hi>Take for my firſt Anſwer that which I gave you when you firſt alleadged this place, ch.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 13. <hi>And you muſt pardon me if I ſay</hi> that which he had ſaid before. But how can I take it for full ſatisfaction, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I am referred to the third chap. and here we are ſent back again to the place from whence he came, This, if we might ſay ſo, is plain bo peep. He hath my anſwer there which is yet good. <hi>The Scriptures thus Profaned and by ſuch interpretations truely diſcanoned (as I may ſay) are rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that effect which St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtles (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to St.</hi> Peter) <hi>had with ſome men,</hi> i. e. <hi>they are ſubject to be depraved by them to the perdition of their Interpreters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is this to us? And yet will they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are ſubject to deprave the Scripture, therefore is Scripture ſubject to be depraved? And after the ſame manner that the Scriptures may be <hi>diſcanoned</hi> by ſuch interpretations, ſo may alſo the Decrees of the Councils, if men have a greater reverence of the Decrees and Canons of Councils than of the Holy Scriptures. And if Scripture be <hi>diſcanoned</hi> by a falſe ſenſe, then Scripture is cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a true; and ſo then by giving a true ſenſe
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:40740:310"/> of Scripture, the Church ſhould make Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which yet is denied by the learnedſt Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians. And alſo if we muſt put upon Scripture the corruptions of men, as he doth by a fallacy of accident, then have we leſſe reaſon to eſteem of Scripture by the authority of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereby the way you are again to take notice, &amp;c.</hi> unto <hi>it was then true.</hi> To that which he ſays here we anſwer again, (ſince he will have it ſo) that the act of wreſting Scripture is damnative, not by the error of the underſtanding, but by the perverſeneſſe of the will; whatſoever the matter of that Scripture be, whether neceſſary or not. And he does well to conclude for us, <hi>Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe places did not (according to your Doctrine) contain points neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> namely, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were hard.</hi> It is right, yet not becauſe they were wreſted they did not contain points neceſſary: for points neceſſary may poſſibly alſo be wreſted: but rather becauſe they were hard to be underſtood. Points hard to be underſtood are more like to be wreſted, than points wreſted hard to be underſtood. And the <hi>perdition</hi> follows not upon the ignorance of the things not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but upon the depravation of the texts. And therefore our <hi>allowance</hi> of ſome <hi>liberty of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations even in hard points, may</hi> not <hi>eaſily prove</hi> damnable. Firſt, the liberty is not ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as neceſſary. Secondly, the liberty is not damnable, but the abuſe. Thirdly, the <hi>allowance</hi> is not ſo much to <hi>hard points,</hi> but things plain, where the Lamb may wade. Fourthly, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the people ſhould know that which is neceſſary to be known: it is accidentall that they ſhould miſ-interpret the text which doth not contain that which is neceſſary. Now ſhall he be
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:40740:311"/> deprived of that which is neceſſary, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent inconvenience; which alſo, if he hath a ſober mind, cannot betide him? <hi>Felix periculum in neceſſariis. Sapiens non curat de accidentali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was then true which I told you in another place, that though the Scripture be a moſt right rule. yet it is very commonly ſo crookedly applied, that we ſtand in need of a better ſecurity of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of it (in which the very kernell of the letter doth conſiſt) than we have of the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (finally ſtood unto) made by the private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own diſcretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> My Adverſary, by his fallacy of accident, is falling upon another queſtion, namely, this, whether it be not dangerous to let men have the free uſe of Scripture: which although it ſeems to conclude for him, yet doth not punctually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt me in the particular point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, namely, whether the Srcipture doth plainly deliver things neceſſary. As it is ſaid by ſome, that ſome Hares when they are hotly hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted will ſquart before another hare, to put the Hunters upon a new chaſe: ſo he would ſtart as it were another queſtion to put me off from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the right queſtion. But ſecondly, we will follow this alſo: and we ſay that he here grants as much as which extenſively concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. For if the Scripture be a <hi>moſt right rule,</hi> as he confeſſeth, then are we to be ruled by it. Let me aſk, why did God give us <hi>this moſt right rule?</hi> what, to be laid aſide, becauſe by ſome it is <hi>crookedly aplied?</hi> Is this a good conſequence? Becauſe the authority of the Church hath been ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Hereticks; therefore we ſhould not urge the Authority of the Church. Becauſe the Goſpel
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:40740:311"/> doth harm to ſome by their corruption, therefore we ſhould not have it preached. Becauſe <hi>Dudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius,</hi> the Biſhop of five Churches, ſaid of the Trent Council, that the Holy Ghoſt had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the Council, and that he was carried in a Carriers Portmantle to Trent, and that the Spirit of God which moved upon the waters could not come to Trent, becauſe the waters were up; therefore we muſt not make uſe of Councils for the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Controverſies. Such conſequences his argumentation affords; let them own theſe, or retract their reaſoning. Thirdly, where ſhall we have a <hi>better ſecurity of the Interpretation of it?</hi> Let them firſt ſecure a better ſecurity of the Interpretation of it. It is true, if the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Council be compared with the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a <hi>private judgement,</hi> it is probable that the Interpretation of a Council ſhould be better, but the queſtion is, whether we can have ſecurity for faith by the Interpretation of a Council. This we deny, ſince Councils may poſſibly erre in the Interpretations of ſome texts; and particularly the Trent Council did err in ſome Interpretations, as ſome of the Divines therein have ſignified. And then fourthly, he doth freely or inconſiderately miſtake our cauſe in the allowances we give to the private judgement of diſcretion: for we do not ſay that we ſhould <hi>finally ſtand to</hi> our private Interpretation, either as to determine others thereby, or to prefer our own Interpretation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that publick judgement of a Council; but this we ſay, that the ſenſe of Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtruded to us as to believe it upon their account, unleſſe we ſee good reaſon out of Scripture for it. The <hi>private judgement of
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:40740:312"/> diſcretion</hi> hath not it ſelf in this caſe, as in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary competition to the Council; but hath it ſelf negatively, and is upon the ſuſpenſe, till it ſees Gods word for it.</p>
            <p>But he knew my anſwer, as it ſeems. <hi>I know your anſwer is, that it is accidentall to this rule to be miſapplied, and this cannot infringe the authority of Scripture.</hi> Yes, this was in ſubſtance my anſwer before. But now it will not ſerve, as my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary would perſwade me by his diſtinction. <hi>It doth not indeed infringe the authority of Scripture u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as God would have it uſed with due ſubmiſſion to the publick Interpretation of the Church. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. unto <hi>neither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He means private judgement of diſcretion doth <hi>not infringe the authority of the Scripture u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as God would have it uſed:</hi> but the miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it (which he ſhould have ſpoken to) doth <hi>infringe the authority of the Scripture ſo uſed.</hi> So we ſee he did not diſcourſe properly. But ſecondly, he ſeems here to make nothing almoſt of Scripture unleſſe <hi>uſed with due ſubmiſſion to the publick Interpretation of the Church.</hi> And this alſo in effect begs the queſtion, whether we cannot make uſe of Scripture well, as unto neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without ſubmiſſion to the publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Church; and alſo again it begs the queſtion, whether we are bound to ſtand to no ſenſe of Scripture without ſubmiſſion to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Interpretation of the Church. Yea, thirdly, we may alſo <hi>crookedly</hi> apply the determinations of the Church, as hath been ſhewed <hi>de facto;</hi> and therefore why doth he argue againſt the uſe of Scripture as the rule becauſe it may yet be <hi>croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly applied?</hi> This argument is to us common with them: we can uſe it againſt the Church, as
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:40740:312"/> they uſe it againſt Scripture and therefore this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine our particular Controverſie. Yea, fourthly, the Scripture which is acknowledged by my Adverſary <hi>a moſt right rule,</hi> is a rule to the Church too, is it not? If not, then have they no Divine authority to ſhew for the authority of the Church: if ſo, then we can make uſe of Scripture without the authority of the Church, becauſe we make uſe of Scripture for the authority of the Church. <hi>Omne per accidens reducitur ad aliquid per ſe.</hi> So we may make uſe of Scripture by it ſelf; and therefore the authority of Scripture may be infringed without reſpect to the authority of the Church. And therefore all he ſays comes to nothing, unleſſe he proves two points. Firſt, that Scripture needs an infallible Interpreter for things neceſſary: The ſecond this, that <hi>God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us of an infallible Interpreter</hi> with infallible knowledge who it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither is this to ſpeak more irreverently of Scripture than St.</hi> Peter <hi>ſpoke of St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> He ſays, the Scripture is a <hi>moſt right rule:</hi> good. He ſays, it is infallible: good. He ſays he ſpeaks no more irreverently of it, than St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles: good. Good words. and we give good words for his good words. But doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> put in the authority of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Interpretation of the Church to be neceſſary to the right applying of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles? This did not St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Did he ſay that St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles doth not plainly contain any thing neceſſary to ſalvation? this did not St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Did he ſay, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies in his Epiſtles, that the Church is our infallible Guide, and the way ſo plain that fools<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This did not St. <hi>Peter.</hi> If they will believe him without the atteſtation of his ſucceſſor, let them conſider what he ſays in his 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 19, 20, 21. <hi>ver. We have alſo a more firm word of Prophecy.</hi> More firm, or moſt firm; as ſometimes the Comparative for the Superlative. More firm ſurely than the Church (which in part, is built upon it, as St. <hi>Paul) Whereunto ye doe well that ye take heed as to a light ſhining in a dark place, &amp;c.</hi> And if a light ſhining in a dark place, then it hath not ſuch need of an infallible Interpreter: we ſee light by itſelf. It is not ſo dark and obſcure as my Adverſary would have it: for it is a light ſhining in a dark place. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if that a light and ſhining in a dark place, then the whole new Teſtament is a light ſo clear and ſufficient as that we need not the help of an infallible Judge either to this light; or in this light. And can it be well immagined that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>being not of private exhibition or delivery, becauſe Prophecy came not of old time by the will of man, but holy men ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> can it be imagined that this ſhould be by the Holy Ghoſt ſo obſcurely or ambiguouſly propoſed, as that we muſt have neceſſity of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Judge to make the ſenſe of it ſufficiently plain to ſalvation? If the Holy Ghoſt can clearly give us the ſenſe as ſpeaking by his Church, could he not as plainly give us the ſenſe as when he ſpake by the Prophets? Have we need of another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and Revelation of the ſenſe? But it ſeems by them God muſt accomodate the ſtile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the uſe of the Roman Church, and muſt invelope it in cloudy difficulties, that we muſt go to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee the Sun of Righteouſneſſe ſhining there, as in <hi>Delos,</hi> without a cloud.</p>
            <pb n="711" facs="tcp:40740:313"/>
            <p>And this alſo is enough to anſwer what follows, which is ſo much out of the way, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find our queſtion in it, whether things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary are plainly contained in Scripture. For what is this to it, that <hi>nothing more clear than that the words of Scripture are capable of ſeverall ſenſes?</hi> If he means in all Texts, he is as eaſily contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, nothing more clear than that ſome <hi>words of Scripture are</hi> not <hi>capable of ſeverall ſenſes.</hi> If he means of ſome: what is this to the <hi>Elench?</hi> We can ſay ſome words are capable of ſeverall ſenſes conſiſtently to this, that things neceſſary are plain. And as to his queſtion, <hi>how ſhall we infallibly know Gods ſecret intention</hi> (in which ſenſe, or whether in <hi>both</hi> he intended them) <hi>but by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter having infallible aſſiſtance from the ſame Holy Spirit, who aſſiſted thoſe who did write the Scriptures?</hi> We anſwer, firſt, as before, it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not the queſtion unleſſe it be applied to <hi>words</hi> which ſpeak of neceſſaries to ſalvation: and then we deny it, that ſuch texts are ſo perplexed. Secondly, ſome texts we may take in divers ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not contrary. Thirdly, as he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us an infallible Judge: ſo here he doth not prove a need of an infallible Interpreter; unleſſe he could prove that it is neceſſary to ſalvation, that we ſhould know the intended ſenſe of every doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſſage in Scripture. Neither again fourthly, (for they ſhall have it <hi>toties quoties</hi>) the definitions of the Councils are, ſome of them, <hi>ex compoſito,</hi> ſo framed, as that we do not clearly ſee the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council in what <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>whether in both the words</hi> ſhould be taken. And muſt we not then, according to my Adverſary, have another infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Interpreter of them? And if they deliver not the thing clear, then another infallible Interpreter
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:40740:314"/> of them? and if they deliver not the thing clear, then another infallible Interpreter of them: and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi> And if they ſay, it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in points of queſtion indubitably to decide in plain terms which part is to be held, then we aſk why they do not allow a latitude to us: ſince the Council by them is intended for a remedy. And therefore need we not again ſay, that we do not give <hi>ſo much ſcope to ſuch poor creatures as ignorant men are.</hi> They have but their rational liberty to find the way of Salvation in the Scripture, unto which it was appointed, in things doubtfull, we ſay they ſhould conſult with learned men. We do not <hi>inveſt them with ſo ample a faculty to interpret it without any interiour ſubmiſſion to the Church.</hi> They take their own freedom and right to ſee reaſon why they ſhould ſubmit to the Church, either as clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſenſe, or proving its infallibility. They are bound to ſee good reaſon why they differ from the Church; but they are not ſimply bound to believe upon whatſoever reaſon the Church gives or none. Neither doe we ſay, that he may <hi>ſtand out in his judgement againſt the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of whole Generall Councils;</hi> not ſtand out in an heady oppoſition, but yet may ſay, <hi>Salvo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liori judicio,</hi> that he muſt ſee how, what they define be correſpondent to Scripture, in points of belief. Secondly, how ſhall poor ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures know what ſeverall Generall Councils have agreed in, ſince ſome have differed from others, as hath been ſeen? They muſt know by infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that the Councils have defined this; and then that they have defined it infallibly. And ſo they put poor ignorant men upon greater difficulties. And if it be ſaid that the ignorant men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church, that ſuch a point is defined by
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:40740:314"/> the Councils: it is anſwered, no: we are to believe, according to my Adverſary, the Church onely as it is infallible; and that is in Councils confirmed by the Pope. Thirdly, if the Church be the way for poor ignorant creatures, becauſe of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty (pretended) of Scripture; yet as to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, it ſeems it is not neceſſary that it ſhould be the way to them, becauſe to them, being ſo learned, the Scripture is not ſo difficult: and therefore upon the matter, we may conclude, that it is more reaſonable, that ignorant men ſhould goe the way which learned men ſhould goe in, than that learned men ſhould go the way which fools and ignorant men go in.</p>
            <p>So then that which my Adverſary ſays after, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, needs not be traduced, <hi>And yet this very ſelf ſame man is wiſely by you ſent to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. Any Miniſter of the Goſpell, ſay you (but) I muſt not ſay any Generall Council is able compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently through the Scripture to direct the people to their happineſſe.</hi> This, and more of this kind he hath with ſome undue reflexion upon his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary with an Ironie; but if all be weighed, and the reflexion not weighed, all will come to not much. For, firſt, I never gave him occaſion to think that I preferred the judgement of a ſingle Miniſter before the judgement of a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. But that which I ſaid, if he would have taken notice of it, doth infer a great deal of reſpect to the faculty of a generall Council. For if I ſay that a ſingle Miniſter may competently inform us of ſo much as is neceſſary; then much more a generall Council. And this is implyed in the words of him that doth give a due reſpect to Councils. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he might alſo have remembred that this uſe
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:40740:315"/> of a Miniſter of the Goſpel was ſpoken upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the text, or may be grounded thereupon, that <hi>the Scriptures were able to make wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> therefore upon the place it is to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to things neceſſary to ſalvation, which doe not need ſo judicious a debate of a Generall Council; becauſe there is no ſuch difficulty in the ſenſe of them. If I ſay that my Adverſary could have told us, that the authority of the Church is in the Pope and a Council, do I prefer my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary before a Pope and a Council, or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and a Pope; (for it is a mighty queſtion which is ſuperior, ſince they have no mind to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Council of <hi>Conſtance?</hi>) And if I ſay, my Adverſary could have ſatisfied ſuch a ſcruple about the number of Orders, do I ſay that my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary could have aſſoyled all doubts in Theology as well as a generall Council? I did not ſpeak of a Miniſter excluſively to a Council in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authority; but excluſively rather to a Council in the neceſſity thereof. And this ſets the accent upon the Council, <hi>ex abundanti.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not drive the compare <hi>ad idem:</hi> for I ſpoke of the ability of a Miniſter as to things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which are ſufficiently plain of themſelves: he brings me in ſpeaking of a Miniſter, as to things of queſtion which are not neceſſary: and this therefore is not logically done; for comparation muſt be in the ſame kind. Now ſurely a Miniſter of the Goſpel may as well inform us as to things neceſſary which are ſufficiently plain, as a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Council in things of Controverſie, which are not neceſſary to be believed on either part. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>judgement</hi> of the Church were not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the word of God, but we take the word from the Church, as <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſays in his Epiſtle
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:40740:315"/> dedicatory of his Doctrinall principles (and yet herein he ſeems to beg the queſtion, whether the Scripture was intended onely to bear that ſenſe which the Church gives of it) yet as to things ſufficiently plain, there is no need of conſulting the judgement of the Church; becauſe they are ſuch, then, as they will ſay, that the definitions of a Councill are ſo plain, that any Prieſt of theirs may inſtruct the people in the rignt ſenſe: ſo the Scriptures are ſo plainly delivered as to things neceſſary, that any Miniſter of the Goſpell may make a man wiſe unto ſalvation by them. And we may well ſay that the Scriptures were inſpired for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore have I yielded him what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; yet it being ſo ingenuous, I ſhall alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe it, <hi>Do but allow me this to the Church, that it can competently through the Scripture direct the people to their happineſſe, and we will not contend with you, whether this competent direction ſhall be called an infallible direction or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I could be content to ſtand to ſuch an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and to compromiſe the diſpute unto ſuch terms. For we can freely allow unto him all this, even <hi>pendente lite.</hi> And we have formerly allowed as much: therefore have they either no mind to accept of our reſpect to the Church; or my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of his own accord is coming to move mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that which he ſays here hath three im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments: firſt, an authority and faculty of the Church; which we have granted. Secondly, that this authority, in the exerciſe of its faculty is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective through the Scriptures. Thirdly, that this direction to the people is competent to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Only let it be provided, that the Church its direction of the people by the Scriptures doth not
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:40740:316"/> derogate from the peoples uſe of the Scripture; thus we can afford all this: for this is no way contradictory to our propoſition, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth contain plainly all things neceſſary to ſalvation: or not this alſo, that a Miniſter of the Goſpell may competently inform the people in the neceſſaries to ſalvation. And if a Miniſter can do it, ſurely the Church. But the ſtreſſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe lies in this, whether what the Church can doe may not ſufficiently be done without the Church: And then ſecondly, if not without the Church, whether it may not be done without the Church its infallibility. Now to this laſt my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſpeaks thus, that he ſtands not upon this, whether <hi>this competent direction ſhould be called an infallible direction or not.</hi> No? doth he not? Then he ſeemeth to yield that which he hath ſo much contended for, the infallibilitie of the Church; that that is not neceſſary. He hath formerly urged the infallibility of the Church to ground faith; now he either grants, that we may be ſaved without faith; or, that faith may be grounded without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility: which indeed in my opinion doth yield the cauſe. But then alſo they will give us leave to note that the cauſe betwixt the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt and us, as to <hi>verbum non Scriptum,</hi> is alſo yielded hereby: for if he will ſit down with this poſtulate, that the Church may competently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to happineſſe <hi>through the Scriptures,</hi> then the word not written is ſecluded from a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent direction to ſalvation. For the word not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is abſolutely contradiſtinguiſhed to <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And therefore I ſee no reaſon we ſhould goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this work. which is not ſo hard, as tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <pb n="717" facs="tcp:40740:316"/>
            <p>But that he calls us back with an <hi>Epanorthoſis, Though we think it moſt certain that no fallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection can competently direct the people to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Well, will they ſtand to this? Where ſhall we have them? If it can, then as before. If it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not upon their ſecond thoughts; then we ſay, <hi>abſolute loquendo,</hi> we grant it; thus, that the Church not propoſing any infallible direction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not competently direct us; and therefore untill they prove the Church infallible in their traditions infallible too: or as to the interpreting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they have no cauſe by their own argument to obtrude ſo often the authority of the Church; becauſe it is no competent direction to happineſs, unleſſe it be infallible, as they now think. But take the Church as propoſing Scripture, which we have hitherto made plain ſufficiently as to things neceſſary; ſo, though the Church be not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its own direction, yet being conſidered, as bringing Scripture which is infallible, it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently direct unto happineſſe. And ſo theſe great magnifiers of the Church, upon due account, have left us in the field to defend the Church when they have left it. We can make uſe of its competent direction, with the Scripture, which is certain and infallible. They cannot make uſe of the Church without infallibility. So then, as the Catholick Moderator ſays of the reformed religion, that it cannot be blamed in the point of juſtification, ſince it lays hold upon that which can certainly ſave us, namely, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: ſo alſo to be ſure, here we are on the ſurer hand, becauſe we make uſe of that which is certainly infallible, the Scripture; and alſo of that which gives us ſome competent direction, the Church; ſpecially taking the Church univerſally for place and time. It is no
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:40740:317"/> queſtion that the preſent Church cannot end the preſent controverſies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now becauſe, by the way, I did ſay our Church could not err in damnative errors, you conceive me to grant that it may err in points not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is well put in <hi>[by the way I did ſay]</hi> he ſpake it more than once; and it appeared alſo to be ſpoken proviſionally, that there might be ſome refuge for the Church, if it ſhould be convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of ſome error; yet not <hi>damnative.</hi> And ſurely it were better for them to lie cloſe under the buckler of this diſtinction unleſſe they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arguments to prove univerſall infallibility. But ſince, it may be, Mr. <hi>Knot's</hi> inconveniences of that diſtinction have been found prevalent, and ſo it is quitted.</p>
            <p>He expounds himſelf thus, <hi>When I ſaid theſe words I did onely take and ſubſume that which you your ſelves moſt commonly grant unto the Church, that it cannot err in damnative matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This but one degree from a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He ſays he meant it as we. If he meant it as we, how doth he conclude againſt us? We hold it diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, upon the caſe of the whole Catholick Church; though a particular Church may err in points damnative. So then he, meaning it as we, leaves the way plain to inferr that he held that the Church might err in points not <hi>damnative.</hi> If he <hi>did take</hi> it as we, we are agreed: and then by Mr. <hi>Knot's</hi> argument infallibility is extinguiſhed. He uſed it formerly in way of diſtinction, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificatively or not. If not, then the uſe of it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly is none: if ſo, then he is loſt. And they may very eaſily perſwade themſelves that we can allow unto them this priviledge of the Church,
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:40740:317"/> that <hi>it hath a main advantage over any Miniſter, or private Interpreter.</hi> This we can afford unto them without abſolute infallibility of the Church. If they will be contented with ſuch a priviledge to the Church as no Miniſter or private Interpreter can have, they need not exceed the diſtinction of the Church's not erring in damnatives, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically taken. For a private Miniſter or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter may erre in damnatives. Yea, alſo this exemption from errors damnative (in this ſenſe) gives a demonſtrative <hi>reaſon why we ſhould not follow our own interpretations,</hi> without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe, becauſe the Church (univerſall) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err in damnatives, therefore we ſhould prefer that, when we ſee not plain cauſe to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and becauſe it may err in other things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot we abſolutely yield the Church obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith for its own ſake. And our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the Church in interpretations are not therefore <hi>damnative</hi> ſimply becauſe we differ from the Church, but if we contemn the Church which hath authority and more faculty, and if we wreſt hard texts, as ſome men did in <hi>St. Paul's Epiſtles to their own perdition, as St. Peter ſaith.</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may be <hi>flatly contrary</hi> and not <hi>damnative.</hi> till the Church be proved without poſſibility of error, to be without poſſibility of error: let them then hold the former diſtinction untill they can make good theſe two points: firſt, that the Church cannot err at all: the ſecond, that all error is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native. Theſe are two hard propoſitions; and therefore, if that which is moſt hard is moſt eaſily broken, as the rule is in the Trent Hiſtory, they ſhould do well to break them.

               </gap>, to teach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out envy, to learn without ſhame. But I need not learn from my Adverſary how to order my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in this particular. The forenamed text, which I uſed in my ſecond rejoinder, was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced patly againſt his aſſertion, that, <hi>If God had not left us the infallible direction of his Church, he had not well provided for the ſalvation of men.</hi> To this I oppoſed the text in the 15, and 16. v. that <hi>the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation:</hi> And by conſequent, God hath well provided for ſalvation of men in generall. Then I urged the particulars, in which it is able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, in the 16. ver. And now, becauſe I did not conclude punctually againſt the terms he hath in this paper, (and yet, <hi>nemo teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur divinare</hi>) he tells me, that I and ours <hi>have a notable talent in not concluding contradictorily.</hi> As he ſaid in <hi>Tacitus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam tu tam fortiter fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
               <pb n="721" facs="tcp:40740:318"/> To the buſineſſe then, we ſay, firſt, that my Adverſary did, or might know, that in a diſcourſe every Syllogiſm, or proof, or anſwer, doth not formally, and <hi>in terminis</hi> conclude againſt the main queſtion. It is ſufficient if it concludes againſt the laſt inſtance: for if that be rightly made, the virtue thereof will rebound ultimately to the principal queſtion. And ſecondly, as to his Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, which he thinks concludes abſurdly upon our opinion, we ſay it is unanſwerable, becauſe it hath neither mode nor figure. He had better have put it into an <hi>Enthymem;</hi> or a full Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm thus: Whatſoever is inſpired by God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains plainly all things neceſſary to ſalvation. All Scripture is inſpired by God, therefore all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now he had the wit not to put it thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhould, ſo, eaſily have denied the <hi>major,</hi> as it is to be taken in the note of univerſality, <hi>[whatſoever]</hi> diſtributively; yea, alſo and becauſe whatſoever ſo is inſpired doth not contain any thing neceſſary to ſalvation: for every thing in Scripture doth not contain any neceſſary point. And therefore like a Sophiſter he wraps it up in an obſcure form; yea, none, that it might not be diſcovered. Thirdly, if <hi>All</hi> in the propoſitions be taken collectively or complexively, ſo we own the matter of the propoſitions, and the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath nothing in it but ſound Doctrine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſequences of <hi>teaching ſubmiſſion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Church, and by her all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation.</hi> And fourthly, he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly have taken <hi>all Scripture</hi> complexively: for if it were to be underſtood diſtributively, then, if every part of Scripture were profitable to all thoſe ends, what would become of their addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>verbum non ſcriptum?</hi> If every part could
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:40740:319"/> make the man of God perfect, what uſe of the merchandize of traditions, as of neceſſity to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? And yet fifthly, it is like he would have ſwallowed his own diſcourſe for the Church thus, All definitions of the Church are inſpired by God. All Doctrine of the Church inſpired by God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all things neceſſary to ſalvation; therefore all definitions of the Church contain all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation. This would have pleaſed him well, ſince he ſays the Scripture teacheth all things neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> by this one arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, becauſe it <hi>teacheth us ſubmiſſion to the Church and by her all things neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſixthly, he miſtakes me ſimply, or worſe, if he thought that I meant to conclude contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by every particular unto which the Scripture is profitable. He commits herein a fallacie of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, making that to be concluded ſeverally which is to be concluded jointly. And ſeventhly, we will now join iſſue with our Adverſary upon the text, and firſt, upon the 15. ver. thus, That which is able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation contains plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things neceſſary to ſalvation: but the holy Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore the Scripture contains plainly all things neceſſary to ſalvation. And if there be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions made as to the <hi>major,</hi> that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not an ordinary man, and therefore though they might have that effect upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one; we ſay as before, that it follows <hi>ex abundanti.</hi> If there were enough to make him wiſe, then <hi>a majori,</hi> others; becauſe he, as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, needed more direction, as my adverſary affirm'd with Mr. <hi>Creſſy.</hi> And I hope they will not ſay, that they were able to make him wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe <hi>he had learned them from his youth;</hi>
               <pb n="723" facs="tcp:40740:319"/> for then if they would learn them from their youth they might make them alſo wiſe unto ſalvation: and therefore they ſhould alſo learn them from their youth, as the ſaying of the Jews was, a boy of five yeares old is to be applyed to the Bible. Again, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> if the old Teſtament was able to make him wiſe unto ſalvation, then ſurely the old and the new together: but the old was able to make him wiſe unto ſalvation; the new not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet for <hi>a great part</hi> written, as the Rhemiſts note. And when they can find as much reaſon for the addition of their word not-written to the new Teſtament, as there was for the addition of the new Teſtament to the old, then let them ſay that this text doth not exclude Traditions. If they did ſay, it did not exclude Traditive interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it would be more reaſonable; becauſe the new is added to illuſtrate and declare the old: but it excludes traditions of new matter; becauſe the new adds no new matter to the old. And yet again, as to the manner of delivery of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Scripture; if the old Teſtament, which was more obſcure, was yet able to make <hi>Timothy</hi> wiſe (as to point of knowledge) unto ſalvation: then certainly in the new Teſtament is there ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of plainneſſe, becauſe the new is the old revealed, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2. Ep. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we will put into the argument all the ends unto which the Scripture is profitable. That which is profitable to all thoſe ends ſpoken of in the 16. ver. <hi>to Doctrine,</hi> in things to be known;
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:40740:320"/> 
               <hi>to redargution</hi> of errors; <hi>to correction</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <hi>to inſtruction, in Righteouſnes, that the man of God might be perfect, furniſhed for every good work,</hi> doth ſufficiently provide all unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> as before; and alſo with ſufficient plainneſſe, ſince the old Teſtament could do it before the new was conſigned: but the Scripture taken <hi>in complexo</hi> doth ſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this text is ſufficiently full and clear againſt them.</p>
            <p>And his argument out of this text againſt me, wherein he ſays he hath <hi>a contradictory concluſion againſt me,</hi> we will now hear: this it is. <hi>That which in this text is ſaid onely to be profitable for theſe ends, is not thereby ſaid to be ſufficient to theſe ends; and yet much leſſe ſufficient to end all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies neceſſary to ſalvation by it ſelf alone: but the Scripture in this text is ſaid onely to be profitable to theſe ends here expreſſed: Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Anſwer unto this of his may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>major</hi> of my laſt Syllogiſm. For thus <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> and my Adverſary diſtinguiſh upon the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> that the Scripture may be profitable and not neceſſary for theſe ends; and ſo in effect, the Rhemiſts upon the text, <hi>that the reading of the Holy Scripture is a great defence and help of the faithfull, eſpecially of a Biſhop.</hi> And this is the ground of his Argument. We anſwer therefore, firſt; if he means his <hi>major</hi> thus, that what is not ſaid in terms to be ſo, is not ſaid ſo by conſequence neither, his <hi>minor</hi> is not true. And if he mean it otherwiſe, it is peccant in the ignorance of the <hi>Elench;</hi> for we can acknowledge his Concluſion without prejudice to our cauſe: for though it be not ſaid ſo in terms, yet by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence,
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:40740:320"/> and <hi>interpretative</hi> it is. Secondly, to the <hi>minor</hi> we ſay, though it be only ſaid to be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: yet ſince it is not ſaid that it is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, it doth not exclude ſufficiency: that which affirms ſo much ſimply doth not ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: for then we could no way reconcile divers hiſtoricall paſſages of the Evangeliſts. But that it doth include ſufficiency, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and my Adverſary do deny; <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to <hi>Chemnitius;</hi> my Adverſary to me. Yet <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſtands not ſo much againſt the term, as if it could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>ſufficient;</hi> but contends that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſufficient alone: <hi>as meat, though it be profitable to nutrition, yet it is not ſufficient alone. For if naturall heat be wanting or any other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body neceſſary to nutrition, it will not nouriſh, in his fourth B. de verbo Dei non ſcripto, cap.</hi> 10. But what is this to the purpoſe? For we doe not maintain the Scripture to be ſufficient to ſalvation, alone; for there muſt be faith and repentance and obedience. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> adds upon the place, <hi>through faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> but we ſay it is ſufficient <hi>in ſuo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> as to direction of us: this ſatisfies our cauſe. If this be confeſſed, we have done. As meat is ſufficient as to the matter which ſhould nouriſh: ſo the word of God is ſufficient, as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of things neceſſary to be known; yea, for our comfort too, as <hi>Iſid. Clarius</hi> upon the text: and therefore he ſays when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had uſed many conſolations, he uſeth here the greateſt. <hi>For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the moſt ſtrong conſolation to have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſent from Heaven, quae et tantis in tenebris lumen praeferat, et graviſſima quaeque efficiat ut fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant levia. And theſe comforts (he ſays) he did ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably give him when he was to tell him of the ſad
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:40740:321"/> news of his departure.</hi> And as for the word there, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if we would take aim of the ſenſe by the Syriack (ſince the Greek intimates the Hebrew in the new Teſtament, and the Syriack is called the Hebrew in the new Teſtament) it ſeems to be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as is ſufficient; becauſe the word for [pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable] in the Syriack is taken from a word which ſignifies to abound and exceed. Thirdly, although all that is profitable is not ſufficient (though all that is ſufficient is profitable) yet that which is profitable <hi>ut ſic,</hi> as to perfection, ſeems very ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. That which helps him to perfection helps him ſufficiently: <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> as to point of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And if it extends not to ſufficencie in the expreſſion: the reaſon may be, becauſe other things alſo are profitable practically. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>ſufficient to end all Controverſies neceſſary to ſalvation by it ſelf alone.</hi> Becauſe there need not be any controverſies neceſſary to ſalvation: yea, rather neceſſary it is that there ſhould be no Controverſies about things neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: becauſe poſſibility of error in thoſe things is ſo dangerous. And therefore he ſuppoſeth that which is not to be ſuppoſed. <hi>For the man of God may be perfect by Scripture; ready furniſhed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work.</hi> The man of God; to wit, the Miniſter. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Timothy</hi> according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Jewiſh Title, <hi>but thou man of God flie theſe things.</hi> And this we ſtrengthen with St. <hi>Cryſoſtom's</hi> note upon the text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not ſimply partaking, but with accurateneſſe furniſhed: and again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Inſtead of me thou haſt the Scriptures (not tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) if you will learn any thing from thence you may, ſo that the Fathers comment imports the
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:40740:321"/> Scripture to be ſufficient, as to learning. If any thing elſe could be pretended as equally profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then either St. <hi>Paul's</hi> teaching him: but he was to depart; and in ſtead of him he was to have the Scriptures; or traditions: but he ſaith not, thou haſt the word not written; but thou haſt the Scriptures; and that the man of God by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be with accurateneſſe furniſhed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore untill they can find any thing ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture, or any thing neceſſarily condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the ſufficiency of Scripture, we reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with our cauſe upon account of this text; wherein alſo, as uſually, by a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, leſſe is ſaid: more is underſtood. If the Pontificians had ſuch a text for their cauſe; this <hi>profitable</hi> text would have been made ſufficient.</p>
            <p>As for the third anſwer, that <hi>St. Paul doth not ſo much as ſpeak of the whole Canon of Scripture; whence he is moſt weakly cited to prove that the whole Canon containeth clearly all things neceſſary to ſalvation;</hi> We may not ſay that this is <hi>weakly</hi> urged. For the argument proceeds <hi>a fortiori,</hi> as before. If part of the Canon; if the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſufficient, then the whole much more. And if Traditions were neceſſary to be added to the old Teſtament, as happily they will ſay, why did God give us the new Teſtament? And to be even with them again; when they ſpeak of the Roman Church, we might alſo ſay, this is <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> urged, to prove the opinion of the whole Church; becauſe they do not <hi>ſpeak of the whole</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, when this is proved, it is manifeſt that part of the whole Canon is loſt. How then know you the ſame neceſſary points not delivered in other parts of Scripture were not delivered in theſe parts of
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:40740:322"/> Scripture which are periſhed, and ſo are come not to be extant in writing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The former is, I ſuppoſe <hi>proved</hi> more than they deſire. And to this we anſwer, firſt, if it be manifeſt that ſome part of Scripture is periſhed, he might have told us, which: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſeems it is not manifeſt. No certain and manifeſt knowledge of the generall but by ſome particulars. Secondly, If any part be loſt, it is either of the old, or of the new Teſtament: if of the old, the new hath the ſame matter, as to ſufficiency, with clearneſſe. If of the new; the old was able to make <hi>Timothy</hi> wiſe unto ſalvation. And my Adverſary might have known, that not onely Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> affirms that there is enough in one Goſpel preciſely neceſſary to ſalvation: but alſo that their <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in the former <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>Ch.</hi> ſays that all the utilities of Scripture which here are rehearſed, are found in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Ep. of St. <hi>John.</hi> If any book then be loſt, (which we are not certain of, nor they neither, becauſe, for ought we know, not defined by the Church) yet by nis opinion (namely, <hi>Bellarmins</hi>) that which remains may be profitable, (yea, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient) for thoſe uſes without an infallible Judge. And again, if any book of either Teſtament or any of both be loſt, this will redound to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Roman; becauſe they account that they onely are the Church, and that the Church is the keeper of Divine truth; then they have not faithfully preſerved the truth of God; and therefore, if they were infallible in what they doe propoſe how ſhould we truſt them, that what is delivered as truth, they would keep; ſince through their negligence they have let ſome book or books of Scripture periſh? <hi>Quis
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:40740:322"/> cuſtodiet ipſos cuſtodes?</hi> But it may be they have kept traditions more faithfully. Then ſurely the books of Scripture were loſt with good diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it might reflect honor to the integrity of Traditions.</p>
            <q>O ſanctas Gentes quibus haec naſcuntur in hortis Numina!</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Your ſecond Text to prove this is Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Here is the text;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 10.</note> 
               <hi>but where is the contradictory concluſion</hi> in terminis, <hi>and that evidently? that it is plainly ſet down in Scripture that the Scripture by it ſelf alone is ſufficient to decide all neceſſary Controverſies, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Omne reducitur ad principium,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas's</hi> rule is. The occaſion of this began thus. I was to diſpute againſt the Judges authority to bind upon his own account; as he might have noted, had he pleaſed. My argument was this, the Judge determins by Scripture or not. If not, then he makes a new law; and the authority of the Church in propoſing Divine truths is immediate by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, and not by diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (which <hi>Stapleton</hi> denies in the beginning of his ſixth generall Controverſie) if by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then doth his determination bind by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture, whereof he is but a Miniſter. This my Adverſary ſays not a word unto. Then <hi>ex abundanti;</hi> I put this text to him to give him a check in the courſe of his exceptions againſt Scripture. We do not ſay that the Scripture is formally a Judge: but yet by this text we have ſo much ſaid as amounts in effect, to be a Judge internall by mediation of conſcience; which is more than their Judge infallible can pretend to.</p>
            <pb n="730" facs="tcp:40740:323"/>
            <p>And therefore as to the demand of a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Concluſion from hence, I ſay, this text was pertinently produced to that purpoſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of it; which was not that it ſhould be a directory weapon againſt my Adverſary, but that it ſhould be of uſe to cut off their Pleas againſt Scripture, as that it is a dead letter, not a living Judge; it is <hi>living, quick:</hi> that it can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; it <hi>is active</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that it cannot decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; <hi>it is ſharper than any two edged Sword.</hi> As the law decides caſes of right, ſo it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides Controverſies of faith. And thoſe points of faith (pretended) which are not contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it doth cut off. If they ſay, it cannot reach the Conſcience: What then can? <hi>It is piercing to the dividing of ſoul and ſpirit, joints and marrow.</hi> If they ſay it cannot judge, it is here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, criticall, exactly judicative of the thoughts and notions of the heart.</p>
            <p>But, to come to the point, he would have me ſhew that this <hi>ſharpneſſe is in order not onely to decide Controverſies, but alſo all neceſſary Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and to do this by it ſelf alone.</hi> And if not, <hi>where is then your Contradictory Concluſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It may decide Controverſies, and not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Controverſies; but if it decide neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, then, to be ſure, it doth decide Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. Our queſtion is whether it determins ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Controverſies. Yea, neither are we bound to diſpute the queſtion, becauſe we ſaid it not, nor are we bound to make it good in their ſenſe. In our ſenſe yet it doth ſufficiently decide all neceſſary Controverſies; becauſe it doth ſo plainly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things of neceſſary faith, that there needs not be any deciſion of them by any inerrable Judge. And then alſo ſecondly, becauſe, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny queſtion about neceſſary points, the Scripture
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:40740:323"/> is the rule according to which it is to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And thirdly, it doth in effect examine and judge in the inward man caſes of opinion and of action, which an externall Judge doth not, as ſuch: becauſe they are not known to him. And in this regard, I conceive, that the heretick is ſaid as before, to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> becauſe the law of God, or of the Spirit of God in the law, doth by his own Conſcience condemn him in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a materiall error againſt his own light. Yea, let them anſwer to their own <hi>Eſtius,</hi> who upon the place ſaith, that the Scripture hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of God attributed to it; and becauſe God ſpeaks to us by Scripture: and therefore he ſaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Gladius penetrat et laedit: ita ſermo Dei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuetur et punit: Itaque ſignificatur cognitio non nuda ſed qualis eſt Judicis examinantis et cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centis ut puniat:</hi> As the ſword pierceth and woundeth: ſo doth the word of God take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and puniſh; therefore is ſignified not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked knowledge, but ſuch as is of a Judge, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and taking cognizance, that it may puniſh. Now becauſe that which is not intended ſometimes proves better than that which was intended (as the rule is, <hi>Melius eſt aliquando id quod eſt per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens quam id quod eſt per ſe</hi>) therefore may we draw an argument in form from hence, thus; That which judgeth, and infallibly, is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge. The Scripture judgeth; ſo the text: and <hi>Estius</hi> upon it: and infallibly; as they will confeſſe; then the Scripture is an infallible Judge. Now if it be an infallible Judge, it is very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that it ſhould be an infallible Judge as to points neceſſary: and then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is no neceſſity of an externall infallible Judge as to determine faith; for that is done by it: there
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:40740:324"/> may be need of a Judge externall, as to peace; but for this there is no need of a Judge infallible. If any thing would content them but a ſpirituall Monarchy, this might: yea, neither, it may be, if ſuch a Monarchy were neceſſary, were this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility neceſſary; becauſe Miniſteriall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth not eſſentially include ſuch an infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>But he goes on, and uſeth an argument againſt me. <hi>The word of God according to your own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was not ſufficient to decide all neceſſary Controverſies before the whole Canon of Scripture was compleatly finiſhed: but St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid this of the word of God before the Canon of the Scripture was compleatly finiſhed. Therefore St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid this of the word of God before the word of God was of it ſelf alone ſufficient to decide all Controverſies. Therefore then it had been falſe to ſay the word of God had been ſufficient to this end. Therefore St.</hi> Paul <hi>did not then ſay ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Beſides what I ſaid before concerning the uſe which I made of this text; and to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what is here ſuppoſed, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was the Author of this Epiſtle to the Hebrews; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>major,</hi> that that part of Scripture was then ſufficient, before the whole Canon was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly finiſhed, in our ſenſe to decide all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Controverſies as well as the old Teſtament was ſufficient to make <hi>Timothy</hi> wiſe unto ſalvation. and for thoſe uſes which are there ſpoken of in that text to <hi>Timothy:</hi> therefore he miſtakes us if he thinks we hold that that part which was then written, was not ſufficient. And yet more might be added by God though not by man; for the Canon then did not reſtrain God but man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we anſwer alſo to the aſſumption, that if he
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:40740:324"/> takes <hi>compleatly finiſhed,</hi> ſimply; then indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid it before the Canon was compleatly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; but if he takes the words ſo as that part which was written was not ſufficient in our ſenſe, we deny it. For then God had not ſufficiently provided for the Church of thoſe times; neither had the Scripture been able to make <hi>Timothy</hi> wiſe unto ſalvation. So the terms in the former ſenſe do not conclude: in the latter they are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but not true. So this ſpecious argument is at an end without its end. Onely, we will now make uſe of the argument againſt him, turning the mouth of the Canon, as we may ſpeak, and it is thus; St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid this of the Scripture before the Canon was compleatly finiſhed; therefore now much rather after it is thus compleatly finiſhed, is it ſufficient. Or more fully thus, The word of God according to his Doctrine is not ſufficient af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Canon is compleatly finiſhed: St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid this of the word of God before the Canon was compleatly finiſhed: therefore his Doctrine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to St. <hi>Pauls, ex abundanti,</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays the word was ſufficient before the Canon was compleated: and he ſays it is not ſufficient after it is compleated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again thoſe words ſpeak not of the word of God blunted with thoſe interpretations which your opinion licenſeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a plain cavill, or a ſlander: we licenſe not any blunting of the edge of Scripture by any miſ-interpretations. We do not deny the uſe of Scripture, as the Romaniſts do to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Neither is it fit for them to complain of blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the edge, who take away the Sword of the Spirit. We onely allow the people to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their own mind concerning the ſenſe of
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:40740:325"/> Scripture: and if the Pontifician authority or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments be able, <hi>ex vi fua,</hi> to perſwade them, that what ſenſe they give is authentick, let them be perſwaded. But it is very uſuall for them to quarrell firſt who are moſt guilty, that ſo they may leaſt be diſcovered. But who blunt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo much as they who ſay the Scripture is like a noſe of wax, which may be turned any way? Let him that is without ſin in this kind caſt the firſt ſtone at us. How they have adulterated Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is known to all the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But of the word of God applied according to the Divinely-ſpirited interpretation of the Church, in whoſe hands, hands guided by the Holy Ghoſt, this word of God is managed for the deciſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, that it is ſharper than any two edged Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> How often muſt we be forced to tell them that we exclude not the uſe of the Church in a due Repreſentative towards compoſing of differences: and alſo that the Church is not now infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt. And therefore that their deciſion is not the laſt reſolutive of faith: and that there is no need of any ſuch infallible Judge for neceſſary Controverſies, ſince there is no neceſſity of Controverſies about things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. And alſo that, if there were ſuch a Judge infallible, we muſt know it, and who it is, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly. And alſo then hereby are excluded the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of traditions: for if the Scripture interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church be to decide all Controverſies, then what need to have recourſe to the word not written, as to that which equally binds in things of faith? And ſo then they deſtroy themſelves. And therefore whereas they ſay frequently that Scripture alone doth not decide all neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:40740:325"/> we can eaſily diſtinguiſh, that <hi>alone</hi> hath reſpect either to the Church or to traditions; as it oppoſeth traditions, ſo alone; and it doth exclude them: and as it doth reſpect the Church, ſo, though it doth not exclude the uſe of a Judge, yet it doth exclude the neceſſity of a Judge infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>His other lines unto the eleventh num. might have been ſpared. <hi>Si non verum prius nec poſterius.</hi> And they have alſo been anſwered.</p>
            <p>And here wiſely he joins to the examination of my former texts,<note place="margin">Num. 11.</note> another text which I produce againſt him in anſwer to the fourteenth number, that he might handſomely decline an anſwer to that, which, if he would have dealt punctually, I ſhould have been anſwered in its place, but we follow him at the running leap. The text is, that of Chriſt, Search the Scriptures. St. <hi>John.</hi> 5.39.</p>
            <p>His exception is this, To prove this to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the Imperative mood <hi>evidently is impoſſible,</hi> therefore, <hi>evidently they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Command,</hi> This is the ſum of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, evident proof they had not beſt urge: for then what will become of all their faith and all their diſcourſe; which doth not amount to ſo much as probability? Secondly, if it be more probable to be underſtood in the Imperative, it is ſufficient to weaken their cauſe; ſince I am to be conſidered, as propoſing the text by way of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, not as an opponent. Therefore if I name a text which is but probable againſt them, it is enough for me againſt them, ſpecially in the cauſe of infallibility; for a probable contradiction undoes infallibility. Thirdly, it is in the Syriack in the Imperative mood: and this interpretation,
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:40740:326"/> if any other ſhould weigh with us. Yea, alſo, ſo do the Rhemiſh Tranſlators read it, in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. Are they alſo decived? then how ſhall we be aſcertained of the ſenſe of Scripture by Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Interpreters? So <hi>Ferus</hi> alſo upon the place expounds it to be a direction to the Jews of ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Scriptures out of a greedineſſe to know the truth. And again, upon the latter words, <hi>They are they which bear witneſſe of me,</hi> he ſays, that Chriſt cites no place, but ſpeaks in generall, <hi>tam ut ad quaerendum incitet,</hi> both that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to ſeek. And ſo alſo <hi>Stapleton</hi> reads it in his <hi>Principia Doctrinalia,</hi> in the Imperative. And alſo beſides, not ſo often do we find a verb of the Indicative mood to begin a ſentence. But then alſo fourthly, the reaſon concludes it a duty: and the duty concludes a command. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a duty thus, that which bears witneſſe of Chriſt, being in doubt we are bound to ſearch: and they bear witneſſe of Chriſt, and were then in doubt; therefore for that our Saviour ſhould not affirm it but upon their opinion (in that he ſaith <hi>for in them ye think to have eternall life</hi>) is no materiall ſcruple, becauſe the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as in other Authors, ſo in Scripture is uſed by way of elegancie: and then our Saviour ſays himſelf that they bear witneſſe of him, and therefore we have in them eternall life Doctrinally. And ſo St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> in his 45. <hi>ſerm. de verbis Domini,</hi> ſays, as expounding the place, <hi>queritis me et non inveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etis: quare? quia non ſcrutamini Scripturas quae teſtimonium perhibent de me,</hi> yee ſeek me but ſhall not find me: why? becauſe you do not ſearch the Scriptures, which bear witneſſe of me. Therefore may we conclude (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) that it is to be taken in the Imperative.</p>
            <pb n="737" facs="tcp:40740:326"/>
            <p>And therefore his exception, that it follows not, <hi>becauſe they teſtifie clearly this one point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſpake, therefore the Scriptures teſtifie cleerly all that is neceſſary to be believed in any point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> that exception falls down before my argument, as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark; becauſe it is not only grounded upon this, that the Scriptures bear witneſſe of him, but alſo in that <hi>[you think to have in them eternall life.]</hi> And this propoſition, if there were need, we might prove by what was ſaid before, that which is able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation hath in it eternall life: the Scriptures (of the old Teſtament) were able to make wiſe unto ſalvation, therefore, they have in them eternall life; and by conſequent, they contain all things neceſſary to ſalvation. And therefore though this excluded not <hi>the hearing of John or Chriſts Miracles,</hi> as he would inferr, as upon duty; yet it excludes them as upon ſimple neceſſity to ſalvation. Otherwiſe thoſe who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> could not have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The force of his ratiocination comes to as much as this, as if becauſe one had a great eſtate, he could not live of leſſe; or as if, becauſe he can live of leſſe he ought not to follow his calling, whereby he may get more. This is not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether we ought to hear whatſoever God ſays: for this we affirm; but this is the queſtion, whether it be ſaid becauſe it is neceſſary, or neceſſary to be heard becauſe it was ſaid: the former we deny. The neceſſity was not antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the diction: but hearing hath it ſelf to the diction, as a neceſſary conſequent. So this text is yet good againſt him.</p>
            <p>Onely he urgeth me with St. <hi>Cyrill's</hi> opinion of the mood, and alſo <hi>Beza's.</hi> I had thought he
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:40740:327"/> would have made no mention any more of any Father of the Church, becauſe he ſays, I do not allow infallibility to their teſtimony. It ſeems their authority muſt yet be good againſt us, though not for us.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Beza's</hi> judgement we will oppoſe, <hi>quoad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> the interpretation of the Rhemiſts and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> as before. To St. <hi>Cyrill's</hi> authority we ſay, we can confront it with St. <hi>Chryſoſtom's:</hi> and yet we do not build upon the mood; for the reaſon binds us. Yet becauſe he ſeems to have his mind turned in better affection to the Fathers, it will be reaſonable to ſet down St. <hi>Cryſoſtom's</hi> words hereupon: <gap reason="foreign">

            <pb n="739" facs="tcp:40740:327"/>
            <p>The citation of this text comes in to give him ſatisfaction unto his argument, that <hi>if Chriſt had intended this book for our ſole Judge in all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, he would undoubtedly in ſome part of this book have told us ſo clearly; this importing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, as it doth, and yet he hath not done ſo.</hi> To this I ſaid, we anſwer, Chriſt hath diſertly declared his will to oblige us unto Scripture in that he bindeth us to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> in that he ſaith, <hi>ye err not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> and alſo adding the other text to <hi>Timothy:</hi> All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by inſpiration; and alſo 2. Ep. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have a more ſure word of Prophecy:</hi> thus I ſaid: and alſo allowed him the uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Judges without neceſſity of infallibility; and alſo I retorted his argument, If Chriſt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Church ſhould have been the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge, it importing ſo exceedingly, he would have told us ſo clearly, which he hath not done, &amp;c. Now if all my texts be able to give a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our being obliged to Scripture in point of faith, and not to an infallible Judge externall, it is enough for me, and my purpoſe, to which I uſed them: but he cunningly draws that text from the proper uſe, and ſhews it here not to be fit for a contradiction to that which formally is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother queſtion than that to which it was apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but let theſe tricks go.</p>
            <p>I will now take the texts together, and from thence conclude contradictorily to the preſent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Whether all things neceſſary to ſalvation be plainly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> thus;</p>
            <p>If we be referred to Scripture in point of faith and not to an infallible Judge, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth plainly ſet down things neceſſary to ſalvation. But we are referred to Scripture (as
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:40740:328"/> appears by thoſe texts) and not to an infallible Judge, (for ought appears clear by my Adverſary) therefore the Scripture plainly ſets down all things neceſſary to ſalvation, the conſequence is plain as denying the reaſon of an infallible Judge; which ſhould be, becauſe we are not ſufficiently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Scripture unto things of faith: then if we be referred to Scripture in point of faith: as there is no need of tradition to ſupply our faith in the matter; ſo neither is there an infallible Judge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to ſupply the want of the Scriptures man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſion. For all the Controverſie betwixt us, in point of Scripture, muſt be reduced to theſe two: either that all which is to be believed, is not contained in Scripture: and this brings in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with them; or, that which is in Scripture is not plainly enough ſet down; and this brings in the queſtion of the infallible Judge. So then, if we be referred to Scripture in point of faith, we need no infallible Church, either for object or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible reſolution of faith. Now as for the <hi>minor,</hi> that we are referred to Scripture, thoſe texts prove ſufficiently, and he cannot deny it: that we are referred to an infallible Judge, he hath not yet proved: and I deny it.</p>
            <p>Yea, what will they ſay, if the laſt text one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves an <hi>Elench;</hi> Thus. If the cauſe of error be not knowing the Scriptures, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe plainly contain all things neceſſary: but the cauſe of erring aſſigned here by Chriſt, St. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.24.28. is the not knowing of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The <hi>minor</hi> is Scripture, the conſequence alſo would be able to maintain it ſelf, but that they think that we cannot draw a conſequent univerſall from an antecedent particular: for the text there is applyed to a particular point of the Reſurrection.
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:40740:328"/> To this we anſwer, firſt, ſimply, we cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue an univerſall concluſion from particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, becauſe the <hi>genus</hi> contains, potentially, more than one <hi>ſpecies:</hi> but they know that the reſurrection is a main point and comprehenſive of more: ſo that <hi>Aquinas</hi> might well conclude him to be an Heretick that denied the immortallity of the Soul, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he denied the Reſurrection. It includes alſo the Reſurrection of Chriſt, 1. Ep. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.13. If there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, then Chriſt is not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. So then, if by the Scripture we may be right in the knowledge of our Reſurrection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in the knowledge of Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which ſuppoſeth his death, that his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, his Incarnation God the Father, (as he ſpeaks, if ye had known me ye had known my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo (then it doth plainly enough ſet down that which ſuppoſeth as much as was neceſſary for thoſe in the time of the Law: becauſe they had enough to bring them into the hope of the Reſurrection: unleſſe we ſay with the Socinians, that they had no hope of the Reſurrection. And ſecondly, if the Reſurrection was ſufficiently declared in the old Teſtament, it being ſo fundamentall a point, what reaſon can be given why other points which are alſo neceſſary ſhould not likewiſe be plainly delivered? And thirdly, if that and other points were competently enough revealed in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that the cauſe of erring was the not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures (not the not knowing of the Church) then ſurely the new Teſtament, which is the old revealed, doth ſet down that and other points with ſufficient plainneſſe unto ſalvation. And this is ſufficient to our purpoſe.</p>
            <pb n="742" facs="tcp:40740:329"/>
            <p>As for the conſequence then from the former Text, which he thinks more probable, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did err, <hi>therefore all things neceſſary to ſalvation are not plainly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> I anſwer, firſt, he argues <hi>ab eſſe ad probabile,</hi> which is not rationall: <hi>ab eſſe ad poſſe,</hi> is good: But we cannot argue, that becauſe ſuch a thing is come to paſſe, that therefore it was probable it ſhould: for then becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did ſin, we muſt ſay it was probable he ſhould ſin; and ſo he had not been created with a <hi>poſſe peccare</hi> and a <hi>poſſe non peccare</hi> in equall freedom: for probability muſt ariſe from an inclination. And if they ſay that the caſe is different from the fall of man: and therefore depravation by the fall doth <hi>non</hi> incline the power of erring to an actuall error, as the power of ſinning unto an actuall ſin; we anſwer, firſt, that they had not beſt enlarge the corruption of nature by the fall, leſt they bring the Trent Council as to this point in danger of error: and ſecondly, we ſay that if they exclude not the grace of God from taking direction by the Church, ſo neither do we exclude the grace of God from taking direction by the Scripture: and if they ſay men cannot err, if with grace, or by it, they take the guidance of the Church: then ſurely with grace, or by grace, it may be as probable not to err through the knowledge of the Scripture; and therefore his conſequence of more probability that the Scriptures are not plain becauſe they did err, is vain. Secondly, if thoſe who erred were but a part and ſect of the Jews, and thoſe that did not err might be the greater number, (if not the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berer,) then it will follow by his own argument, that this was plainly enough ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thirdly, he ſuppoſeth that which is not to
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:40740:329"/> be ſuppoſed, if he thinks that we hold things ſo plainly delivered in Scripture, as that we cannot err whether we will keep the way or not: for Scripture doth directly work upon the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, grace upon the will. It is therefore ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to us to ſay, that things neceſſary are ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed in Scripture, as that if we be dilligent to know and follow Scripture, we need no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church. Fourthly, he might have been adviſed that this diſcourſe of his will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon him to the prejudice of their Church: for it ſhould ſeem then, as hath been often noted, things are not ſo plainly defined by their Church, ſince there are ſuch differences amongſt them; even in grand points. Fifthly, we diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt knowledge <hi>in habitu,</hi> and knowledge <hi>in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu;</hi> their habituall knowledge of the Reſurrection in Scripture might be good, and it might be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough exhibited: but they were defective in the actuall knowledge, in not conſidering thoſe principles of Scripture which might have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, according as our Saviour doth upon the place. And ſurely, as the not conſidering is the moral cauſe of moſt of our evil actions (according to that of the Philoſopher <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore alſo ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I have conſidered my ways and turned my feet into thy Teſtimonies) ſo alſo is the not conſidering Scripture, the cauſe of all, or moſt, of our errors: at leaſt the cauſe of the danger in the errors we have: and if they would ſtudy the Scripture affectionately they could not err as they do. The Principles of Scripture are ſufficient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to habituall knowledge; and yet error may come by want of actuall knowledge: either negatively, by not applying them; or worſe, by miſapplying them, they take ſuch opinions firſt as are of uſe
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:40740:330"/> to them, then will draw Scripture to them, as is obſerved: but they ſhould apply their opinion to Scripture; not Scripture to their opinion. Sixthly, and laſtly, he did not conſider how near he came to Blaſphemy by comming ſo near to a contradiction of Chriſt: for Chriſt ſays to them <hi>Ye err not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> and his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſays by conſequence, that they might err though they did know the text, becauſe it doth not plainly ſet down the Reſurrection, whereby he makes either our Saviour to affirm that they could not know the Scripture which our Saviour plainly ſuppoſeth; or elſe that the cauſe of not erring is not to know the Scriptures, as to that point: which how he will anſwer at that great day, I know not.</p>
            <p>And ſo his Syllogiſm comes to nothing, or worſe than nothing. <hi>For if all things had been plainly ſet down, they ſhould not have erred: but they erred: therefore all things are not plainly ſet down.</hi> His <hi>major</hi> is falſe. If he takes <hi>ſhould not have erred, ex parte officii,</hi> it is true; but not to his purpoſe: if he takes it <hi>ex parte event us,</hi> it is to his purpoſe, but not true. It is not falſe, that they might not have erred: but that they could not err, it is falſe: <hi>A poſſe ad non poſſe non non valet.</hi> Means are not always uſed; or not as they ſhould be. We know our duty plainly in many things, yet we do not do it. This argument is good againſt him; men have erred about the ſenſe of the Trent Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hath been ſaid; therefore all things are not plainly ſet down by the Church: but this Argument is not good againſt us, becauſe we do not allow the form or rule of the argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="745" facs="tcp:40740:330"/>
            <p>His other anſwer is as uneffectuall, that <hi>they might err in the knowledge of the Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the reading of them they did follow their own private Interpretation, which is the moſt ready way to err, ſpecially when men oppoſe the publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And doth this conclude contradictorily to this propoſition, that they might not err if they attended to Scripture? Secondly, they might err if they attended to the Church; becauſe, (for ought is yet confirmed) the Church may err: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſurer way is to attend to Scripture, which they confeſſe is infallible. Thirdly, if he ſpeaks of oppoſing the publick interpretation of the whole Church, we allow more reverence to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church than to theirs. Fourthly, is it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that every one who cannot ſubmit intuitively to all the definitions of the Church in points of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſhould oppoſe the publick interpretation of the whole Church in plain points of faith? Fifthly, <hi>Maledict a gloſſa quae corrumpit textum,</hi> This gloſſe corrupts the text: for there is here a limitation of Chriſts words (which elſe where he accuſeth us of) without any colour from the words of the Text. The Text diſertly repreſents the cauſe of erring in this matter of the reſurrection to be the not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, without any mention of the Church: He will not afford it right, unleſſe we take in alſo obedience to the interpretation of the Church; and his Church too (for otherwiſe he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which was not then ſurely inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the priviledge of infallibility; which was not inveſted upon them, as ſome of their moſt learned affirm, til after the reſurrection of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this were true, it were not pertinent. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon this whole matter, it comes to this, that
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:40740:331"/> it is with them better to believe the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scripture even in plain points, than the Scripture without the Church: for otherwiſe he comes not up to the ſtate of our queſtion. And how good this Divinity is, let thoſe learned ones of their Church judge, who will thus diſtinguiſh of the Scripture, that it is neceſſary but not ſufficient: which alſo in my opinion is by them intended on the behalf of the Church indeed; but not to bring in a new neceſſity of an infallible Judge in matters of Scripture expreſſed, but to bring in neceſſity of Traditions in matters of Faith not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>His exceptions againſt the validitie of this text are two. One, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are not there ſet down, when S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake thoſe words, <hi>becauſe the Canon was not finiſhed.</hi> This we have fully taken away before. The other is thus, how will you prove that <hi>all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture, becauſe one thing is plainly ſet down?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this firſt, take that which was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about the concluding all points neceſſary to be plainly ſet down becauſe that of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſo, with the reaſon thereof: and the reaſon is good here alſo, becauſe he ſeems to confeſſe that that one point of <hi>Jeſus's being the Son of God and the Meſſias, might clearly be found in Scripture.</hi> This me thinks then we have gained, that one point is clearly ſet down in Scripture. And this it may be conceived he might grant me, becauſe I could draw
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:40740:331"/> no conſequence from thence againſt him, for ſo he inſiſts, <hi>how will you infer</hi> ergo <hi>all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture?</hi> We make uſe of it thus. If this point be plainly ſet down in Scripture, then other points alſo neceſſarily concerning his being the Meſſiah muſt alſo clearly be ſet down: ſo then here is a wheel in a wheel, yea, many incluſively in one: and thoſe alſo clear: but <hi>verum prius;</hi> as it ſeems by his own confeſſion. Secondly, if I ſhould ſerve them with a <hi>quare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit;</hi> why do they not as well admit other points to be clearly ſet down in Scripture? what will they ſay? ſurely they will ſay that this point is plainly ſet down, becauſe it is ſo neceſſary. Well then, we reply. If there be degrees of neceſſaries, then we may be ſaved in any degree of neceſſaries. Or, if this be ſet down onely as neceſſary; why not all neceſſaries? For the rule is good, <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia:</hi> If that clearly ſet down as neceſſary, then all things neceſſary are clearly ſet down. The ſame reaſon is the principle of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality; ſurely with God; who doth all things in number, weight and meaſure. For although that <hi>Axiom, Idem quae idem ſemper facit idem,</hi> doth not always follow as in finite Agents, becauſe they may be defective in their power, and there may be want of diſpoſition in the matter they work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it cannot be ſaid that God wanted ability to ſet down other points as plainly: and there is no repugnance <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> that other points ſhould be as plainly ſet down as that; therefore if God in his wiſedom and goodneſſe, cauſed by his Spirit that verity to be clearly delivered for our ſalvation; how can we believe that he did not alſo direct the Pen-men of the Spirit of God to deliver all other points neceſſary to ſalvation with neceſſary plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:40740:332"/> Again thirdly, if the word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was a more firme word than the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Apoſtles (as <hi>Estius</hi> upon the place) as to the Jewes for the faith in the Meſſiah, then where we have that and the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the new, why ſhould we not account this a more ſure word than the word of the Church in this point, or any other contained in Scripture? Why may not we as likely doubt of the Church, ſpecially a particular Church, as well as the Jews might doubt of the Apoſtles? And is not the Doctrine of the old and new Teſtament more ſure than the Doctrine of the Church? To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, it is becauſe there is no light in them; as the Prophet ſpeaks: then the Scripture is the rule of their Doctrine, and therefore more ſure: that which gives credit to others muſt be more credible. Yea, and untill they prove that ſomething new in ſubſtance was added to the new Teſtament above what was contained in the old, that text availes alſo for Chriſtians, againſt any thing not written. Neither can the Romaniſt ſay, that that word of Prophecy <hi>ſhines in a dark place</hi> by the hand of man in the Church: for it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the word as written: and the Prophets who then wrote the word were dead. If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had been then living, it had been reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Jews to have taken their direction from their mouth, as it might be reaſonable for us to take the word of God from the mouth of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, were they now living: but the Prophets are dead, and the Apoſtles are dead; by whom we know God ſpake: but that God ſpeaks now by the Church as he did by them, we are yet to deny untill it be better proved; or theſe texts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwered. But we have one more.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt he ſays that which is to be proved, that thoſe words, <hi>they received the word with all readineſſe of mind,</hi> do inferr rather that they did believe St. <hi>Paul</hi> before they did ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: For though St. <hi>Paul</hi> was infallible in his Doctrine, and therefore might be believed, and ought, yet it doth not appear that they were perſwaded of him: and therefore it is not ſaid they recieved St. <hi>Paul</hi> with all readineſſe of mind, but they received the word: and they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with all chearfulneſſe as good, though they did ſearch it, whether true. Secondly, they might receive it with all readineſſe upon appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of probability, although they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, until by ſearch they found it agreeable to the Scriptures. Yea, ſomewhat may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without probability, and with all readineſſe of mind too, as an Adverſaries paper: And that they did not believe it untill they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it with the writings of the Apoſtles appears more probable by the following words, that they did daily ſearch the Scriptures, if theſe things were ſo: their ſearch was <hi>an ſit;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:40740:333"/> If they did believe, why did they ſtill ſearch and daily ſearch? Doe we ſearch for that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly we believe? Then where is certainty, which Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> makes neceſſary to faith? But he himſelf will ingenuouſly confeſſe as much as ſeems requiſite for our cauſe, in theſe words, <hi>upon thoſe motives which St.</hi> Paul <hi>propoſed to them before they ſearched the Scriptures, and being by thoſe motives and Inſtructions well enlightned to underſtand the Scriptures, they for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort and confirmation, ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily, to ſee whether they teſtified the ſame point, and this one point of our Saviours comming being clearly in Scripture, perhaps St.</hi> Paul <hi>might bid them ſearch in ſuch and ſuch texts for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words we muſt take great notice of: what <hi>motives</hi> they were he doth not expreſſe; but ſuch it ſeems, as <hi>upon which many thouſands did</hi> recieve it <hi>(whoſe proceedings you can never prove leſſe laudable than the Beroeans)</hi> But this his parentheſis does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He might have left it out better. For why then are theſe Beroeans commended? If there was not in them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of excellent ingenuity, why are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for this, that they received the word with all chearfulneſſe, ſearching the Scriptures daily? Doth not this belong alſo to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that they ſearched the Scriptures daily? Nay, it may be, further, if we may have leave to be critical, their receiving of the word with all chearfulneſſe was concurrent with the ſearching of the Scriptures daily: and ſo the participle [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is to be taken <hi>per modum medii;</hi> whereby they came to embrace the word: the uſe of Participles is not, it may be, infrequent in this ſenſe. However, it is not
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:40740:333"/> comely for him, when the Scripture doth give a reputation and honor to theſe Beroeans, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize many thouſands to them.</p>
            <p>But we muſt a little more reflect upon his words. Motives theſe Beroeans had propoſed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> before they ſearched the Scriptures. But what motives? That is not expreſſed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor indeed that they had any: Well, but we give it, that they had motives. And if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church had been one of thoſe motives, my Adverſary would not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. And yet alſo we can grant motives before the reſolution of faith: So that thoſe Beroeans might have motives, and yet not believe before the ſearching of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But this how loath is he to come to, that they did ſearch the Scriptures, as in order to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: Therefore he doth ſubſtitute other ends of their ſearching of the Scriptures; namely. <hi>for their comfort and confirmation.</hi> What? For their comfort and confirmation, and not for their faith? But if the ſearhing of the Scriptures be of uſe to our <hi>comfort and confirmation,</hi> then alſo to our faith: but not to beget it, it may be. No? As in naturalls ſo in ſpirituals, we may be ſaid to be nouriſhed by that by which we conſiſt, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom</hi> 10.17. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. And if it be ſaid that it comes by the word of God ſpoken: It is anſwered, the word of God ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is to be meaſured now by the word of God written, unleſſe we had as good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe that now ſpeak in the Church, as the Jews had to believe the Prophets, or the firſt Chriſtians the Apoſtles. But ſecondly, if the ſearching of the Scriptures was of uſe for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:40740:334"/> and confirmation</hi> of them, then this brings more honor upon the Scriptures, becauſe this is more to be comforted and confirmed by them: for comfort at leaſt, reſpects the application of the Goſpell to us; and if the ſearching of the Scripture be of uſe hereunto, as in the way of a particular faith: then ſurely to a generall faith much more. Thirdly, therefore if he means by <hi>comfort</hi> particular aſſurance, then he turns Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant in this opinion: if not, he will be little differing from faith. But fourthly, theſe Beroe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were here commended for ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether to <hi>comfort and confirmation,</hi> or to faith: and therefore ſurely we cannot be diſcommended hereafter for allowing the uſe of the Bible to the people.</p>
            <p>But this he occurrs to: <hi>Neither hence is it made evident, that the old Teſtament was thruſt into every mans hand of the Beroeans, but that they deputed their chief Doctors to make this ſearch, and that for this point onely:</hi> namely, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours comming, which, he even now ſaid, is <hi>clearly in Scripture:</hi> Well, as we have noted, we have here the main and denominative point of Chriſtians, by his confeſſion, <hi>clearly in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> but the old Teſtament was not thruſt into the hands of every man of the Beroeans, no, not to ſearch them as to this one point: Oh, how tender they are here in this matter! <hi>Si non ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte tamen caute.</hi> But was it put into the hands of any of the Beroeans? if ſo, why not into the hands of all? If not, ſhall the Beroeans in the text ſuppoſe onely for the Doctors, and for none of the People? But ſome it may be would have abuſed the Scripture: and would none of the Doctors? no, will he ſay, not in a clear point:
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:40740:334"/> but would the Doctors then in a controverted point? If ſo, how ſhould we be ruled by them? Yea, neither the people would have abuſed the Scriptures in a clear point, by his own Argument: becauſe <hi>they erred, therefore it is not plainly ſet down.</hi> So then if this point, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Saviors coming, be plainly in Scripture, as he cannot but acknowledge; it ſeems then the people could not err in it. But then again ſecondly, it is not like to be meant of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, becauſe it being a plain point in Scripture, there was no need for them to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily: Therefore moſt certainly it is meant of the people: for the Doctors alſo are not wont to be ſpoken of in a common notion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, it is to be underſtood of theſe Beroeas in oppoſition to the Theſſalonians, as appears by the text, <hi>theſe were more noble</hi> (or more ingenuous) <hi>than thoſe of Theſſalonica:</hi> now theſe in <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> were not of the Doctors: for it is meant of the Synagogue there, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by compare of the firſt verſe of the ch. and the fifth with the reſt. And ſo alſo thoſe who are ſpoken of in <hi>Beroea,</hi> were alſo of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Jews there, as appears by the tenth verſe: now the Synagogue was not a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Doctors, but of the people, with a Maſter. And ſo it was a rule with the Jew, ten make a people: and where there is a people, there is to be a Synagogue: and where a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, there a Maſter. So then this being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them of the Synagogue <hi>per ſo,</hi> it is moſt like to be underſtood, <hi>de communi,</hi> of the people. And fourthly, if it were to be underſtood of the Doctors, I hope the people ſhould have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:40740:335"/> them upon their own word, without the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſearching the Scriptures daily. For if the Doctors be not to be believed without their ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures daily, then, for ought I ſee, we have done; and the Controverſie betwixt us is at an end: becauſe it is to no purpoſe, that their ſearching of the Scriptures ſhould be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the peoples belief, unleſſe alſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be allowed to give their belief conditionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſearch: and how can this be done by them, unleſſe they compare what is ſaid by the Doctors with the Scriptures. For how ſhall we believe the Doctors upon their bare word that they have ſearched the Scriptures? ſo then, in effect, upon this account, the main principle and laſt reſolutive of the peoples faith muſt be the Doctors meer word: and why then ſhould they diſcourſe fallibly, and conclude infallibly, as <hi>Stapleton</hi> would have it?</p>
            <p>To conclude then the debate of this text; we may have, I ſuppoſe, clearly, theſe two corollaries from it. Firſt, that it is not onely lawfull, but commendable, whatſoever the Church ſays, to ſearch the Scriptures whether thoſe things be ſo: for the Church cannot have greater authority upon us than St. <hi>Paul:</hi> (no, nor ſo much neither, till they prove it better) and yet theſe Beroeans were commended for it. And if in a point clearly ſet down in Scripture, (as this was by his own acknowledgement) then in other points much rather, becauſe (by his own argument alſo) in ſuch the Doctors may be more miſtaken: Yea, becauſe alſo, according to our principles, poſitive faith in ſuch points is not ſo neceſſary to ſalvation untill we ſee it plainly
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:40740:335"/> propoſed. Yea alſo, when a point controverted appears plain, the diſbelief is not damnative by the nature of the verity; but becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys Gods veracity; which is the prime tenure of all truth. Secondly, we have alſo this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, that faith comes by ſearching of the Scriptures: for ſo it follows (which my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary had no mind to take notice of) in the very next verſe, the twelfth, <hi>many of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believed.</hi> Therefore; namely, upon ſearching of the Scriptures: ſo that they did not believe blindely, and then ſearched the Scriptures; but ſearched the Scriptures firſt, and then ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, upon principles of Scripture, believed. And theſe two propoſitions are ſufficient to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge the Pope and all his Cardinalls, and all their Religion, as differing.</p>
            <p>So that now the texts (whereunto he would wiſely have anſwered out of due place) being vindicated from his batteries, and ſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in their full ſtrength and force, we may now, after this reinforcement of them, make ſhorter worke: having already given him more than he brings.</p>
            <p>And therefore as for his Argument in this Par.<note place="margin">Num. 15.</note> That this is not plainly ſet down in Scripture, [that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture] and therefore not all things, is anſwered by our deniall of the Antecedent; and the proof of the contrary. For the moment of thoſe texts defended doth ſufficiently confirm the Scriptures ſufficiency in matter and manner to this end of ſalvation. We do not ſay, that <hi>all things neceſſary to decide all Controverſies are plainly ſet down in it:</hi> that is not our aſſertion,
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:40740:336"/> nor the ſtate of the queſtion betwixt us. Our poſition may be true, and yet this falſe: for all things neceſſary to ſalvation may be plainly ſet down in Scripture, and yet not all things neceſſary to decide all Controverſies. Neither can they maintain this of their Church, which they think more fit to decide Controverſies than Scripture, for then why did not the Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil clearly determine on which part many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ſhould be held? But the plainneſſe of things neceſſary is in Scripture ſufficient againſt the neceſſity of any Controverſie; as the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſufficient againſt the neceſſity of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is their word unwritten. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not we bound by any neceſſity of our cauſe to find any Text wherein we are obliged to <hi>take the Scripture for our onely Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies:</hi> for the texts before maintained are good to prove us obliged to Scripture for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereunto things neceſſary are plainely ſet down. If he might have made the ſtate of the queſtion for his own turn; my diſcourſe ſhould have been impertinent. A ruffling Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary would have ſaid that he had ſhifted and ſhuffled in the change of the queſtion, as if we had held, that the Scripture did contain all things neceſſary to decide all Controverſies. All <hi>prime Controverſies</hi> neceſſary to ſalvation, if there need be any, it doth: and that is ſufficient for us againſt them.</p>
            <p>But he thought he had deviſed a way how this opinion might be made good, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſuffice for the deciding of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies; thus; <hi>Yet the Scripture wanteth not that glory of being ſufficient to decide all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:40740:336"/> Controverſies, becauſe ſhe teacheth us that Chriſt hath erected a Church built upon a rock, the pillar and ground of truth, having the Spirit of truth abiding with her to teach her all truth.</hi> O excellent proviſion for the honor of Scripture! One in the Trent Council, as I remember, did not like references; but would have all done uniformely by the ſame hand: but we muſt from Scripture referr to the Church. And as it is ſaid of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a queſtion too difficult, ſaid, he could not tell how to anſwer it, but he would ſhew the party one that could; and then ſhewed him the picture of an excellent Divine: ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot anſwer all Controverſies: but it hath reputation in this, that it can ſhew, and doth, an infallible Judge of all <hi>imaginable Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> the Church. To this, firſt, methinks then, if it were but for this uſe, the Scripture ſhould be more common to the Laitie: becauſe it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo clearly this Judge. Secondly, let them ſhew unto us where the Scriptture doth plainly ſhew unto us this Judge; that they may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger beg the queſtion. And Thirdly, let them tell us why the Church doth not determin all Controverſies, as we have ſaid before; not <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable</hi> onely, but reall Controverſies; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Popes power in compare with a Council, and concerning his temporall power: and concerning the right of Biſhops: concerning original ſin: concerning the conception of the Virgin: were theſe determined with ſatisfaction to all the Members of the Council? Fourthly, doth the Scripture give the denomination of this Church, which is the pillar and ground of all truth, that
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:40740:337"/> ſhould be the infallible Judge? Fifthly, if they think the <hi>Spirit of truth</hi> doth abide with the Church, to decide all Controverſies by way of an habituall gift, then muſt this Church have more priviledge than the Apoſtles had; for they had the Spirit by way of a tranſient gift, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome particular queſtions they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide by the gift of the Spirit: but the Church muſt have a ſtanding faculty to decide all <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> Controverſies. Sixthly, may not we as well ſay, this is for the glory of the Church for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to ſalvation, that it ſends us to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is infallible, and clear enough in things of neceſſary faith? This honour the Fathers, before the univerſal Biſhop, gave to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the Romaniſts now would arrogate it to the Church. If they muſt be brought to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition; which, in ingenuity, ſhould carry the honour, the Scripture according to the Fathers, or the Church according to the Romaniſts?</p>
            <p>But he thinks, according to his principles, he is not engaged to finde a plaine Text, where this is ſet down, that the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould <hi>decide, with infallible authoritie, all our Controverſies;</hi> becauſe, according to them, <hi>all points neceſſary to ſalvation be not plainly ſet down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then firſt, according to our principles, we are not bound to believe it: and we muſt account it no neceſſary to ſalvation, becauſe it is not plainly ſet down. And how then ſhall we know it? what by its own light? or may we know the Church by Scripture, and not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, which is the priviledge? Secondly, How then could he ſay by Scripture, that God hath provided <hi>a way ſo direct that fooles cannot
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:40740:337"/> err?</hi> Thirdly, if he confeſſe that there is not a clear text which ſheweth this priviledge of, and our duty to the Church, then the diſputation is at an end: for he will not diſpute with me from the teſtimony of the Fathers, for cauſes beſt known to himſelf. And if he ſayes, we muſt be judged by the Church; it is the queſtion. Fourthly, therefore are we in this agreed, which is the main point of the queſtion; namely, that the Scripture doth not plainly ſet it down, that the Church <hi>is to decide, with infallible authority, all our Controverſies.</hi> For, if it were plainly ſet down, we alſo ſhould be bound to believe it, as being plainly ſet downe, though it would not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be neceſſary to ſalvation, ſimply becauſe it is plainly delivered. All neceſſaries are plainly ſet down, according to our opinion: but all that is plainly ſet down is not neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>ex natura principii.</hi> And then fifthly, if he doubts of this point, as to be plainly ſet down in Scripture, then his principles are leſs capable of certainty than ours: for he hath no ground certain of his faith, upon the account of the Church; becauſe, if the Church did ground her infallibility upon her owne authority contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to Scripture, ſhe could not, by her owne authority, contradiſtinctly to Scripture, prove that ſhe is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and yet neither hath the Church, or their Church, (for ought I have read) in any of their Councils, determined it ſelfe by Scripture, or otherwiſe, infallible to the deciſion of all <hi>imaginable Controverſies.</hi> Nay, neither do <hi>Bellarmin</hi> or <hi>Stapleton,</hi> if I be not miſtaken, aſſert the infallibility of the Church in this extent; therefore my Adverſary in this walks alone.</p>
            <pb n="760" facs="tcp:40740:338"/>
            <p>Yet he ſays the texts he will produce hereafter are an <hi>hundred times more clear, that the Church is to decide all our Controverſies, than that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by it ſelf alone is to decide them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This comes not home to the point. For firſt, we goe not upon degrees of claritude, but upon infallibility. Can they tell us how many degrees of claritude will make infallibility? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>All our Controverſies</hi> are not ſo much as all <hi>imaginable Controverſies:</hi> there are other Controverſies imaginable beſides ours. Thirdly, he ſuppoſeth that of us which is not true of us, that we affirm the Scripture to decide our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies formally: which we ſay not: we ſay again, that for things neceſſary to be believed there is no need of Controverſie, becauſe they are plainly delivered: for other Controverſies there is no need, as to ſalvation, that they ſhould be decided, becauſe they are not neceſſarily to be believed. And alſo for ſome of their opinions, they are in effect decided, namely, in a negative manner, becauſe they are not mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and therefore <hi>percutit Dei gladius,</hi> as the Father ſpeaks; the ſword of God ſtrikes them off. Fourthly, he is brought to a pinch: he would fain have the authority of the Scripture for the infallible deciſion or the Church: yet becauſe the point is not ſo clear as to amount to our infallibility of their infallibility, he puts it upon degrees of claritude.</p>
            <p>But if it comes to degrees of claritude betwixt the Scripture for the Church, or the Scripture for it ſelf, who ſhall compare and judge? the Church? this is the queſtion, and it is a partie. And perſons are partiall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Law not. And would not they
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:40740:338"/> have men determine for the Church? Yes verily: and he thinks with good reaſon, then he allows them, as is obſerved by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of private diſcretion for the Church out of Scripture, but not for the Scripture out of Scripture. Fifthly, he differs from his own party in this, for they think it demonſtrable out of Scripture, that the Church is with infallible authority to decide all Controverſies. And how elſe can [the <hi>Roman</hi>] in their Trent Confeſſion, be added to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apoſtolick Church? And how did they by their Authority determine that the Latine Bible, which came out firſt by <hi>Sextus Quintus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards corrected by <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, (though the former by them infallible) ſhould be the Judge and Decider of all Controverſies? So that, by the way, although the Scripture in the originall be not a Decider of Controverſies, yet in Latine it may.</p>

            <p>His texts of more claritude for the Church come in afterwards, as he ſays, n. 58, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To paſſe by here that which is not materiall,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> and alſo that which is ſpoken of here to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him hereafter in other numbers of this ch. (which might give us an Alarum, when they come nearer us.) He ſays here, he might have added to other points neceſſary not plainly decided by Scripture, <hi>that great point, whether it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to rebaptize thoſe who are baptized by Hereticks.</hi> And this we will not here paſſe by unſaluted, becauſe we give reverence to St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:40740:339"/> produced by him upon the point. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwer, but with ſome expoſtulation, why doth this come in here? was the latter written before the former? There is ſome myſtery in it: but we paſſe it. We muſt anſwer therefore, firſt, that he miſtakes the queſtion which he is upon: it is not this, whether the Scripture doth plainly decide whether ſuch a thing be neceſſary or not, but whether it doth decide plainly that which is neceſſary. Now here he laies it down as a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion undecided by Scripture, <hi>Whether it be neceſſary to rebaptize thoſe who are baptized by Hereticks.</hi> To determin a thing which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and to determine whether the thing be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, are ſurely two things; the former reſpects the thing as in it ſelf which part is true: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſpects the thing <hi>in modo,</hi> and in order to the end, either of obedience or ſalvation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſecondly, we diſtinguiſh of [neceſſary,] it hath relation either to duty, or to ſalvation: the former is the neceſſity of the precept: the latter of the mean. The former (if ſuppoſed) doth not infer the neceſſity of the knowledge of this point: becauſe we may be ſaved without the knowledge of every thing which is commanded by God, by generall Repentance. Otherwiſe no man could be ſaved: for no man living knows every thing which is commanded, therefore invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance muſt excuſe actuall repentance. Now the ſecond neceſſity doth infer a neeeſſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; becauſe, without the knowledge of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means, we cannot obtain our end. He is therefore to prove it neceſſary to ſalvation to know which part of the Contradiction is right, to rebaptize or not; which he cannot do, becauſe
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:40740:339"/> the practice on either part is not neceſſary by neceſſity of mean. And the practice on either part is not neceſſary by neceſſity of mean; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then either thoſe Churches which differed from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or thoſe that held with him, were in extream peril of damnation; which I think they will not ſay. Wherefore, if either part be neceſſary to be believed, the neceſſity is not <hi>ex vi materiae,</hi> but <hi>ex vi proponendi;</hi> upon the clearneſſe of the propoſing it. Now that which is neceſſary to be believed in the latter kind, doth not belong to our queſtion: for the queſtion is of thoſe things which are to be believed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in order to ſalvation, not neceſſarily to be believed in order to the propoſall; but this clear propoſall is not neceſſary, becauſe the practice on either part is not neceſſary to ſalvation; and therefore this is no neceſſary queſtion. And this diſtinction is ſufficient to deſtroy at leaſt the moſt of all his inſtances of this kind. And thirdly, my Adverſary needed not, as to himſelf, to have made this a queſtion, by reaſon of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their Church: for they account us Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and yet when we come over to them, they do not rebaptize us. And if they ſay, it is now determined by the Church in the negative; we anſwer, it is not yet determined by the Church whether it was neceſſary to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church in order to ſalvation: for then it was neceſſary to ſalvation not to be rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and it was neceſſary to ſalvation to know it: the former puts St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in danger for the evil practice: the latter puts him in danger for want of neceſſary knowledge. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former part of St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> teſtimony
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:40740:340"/> hereunto is not appoſitly produced: for the queſtion now is not whether it be <hi>openly or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently read in Scripture;</hi> becauſe we confeſſe it is not: but the queſtion is of the neceſſity of it to be known. Let then the moment of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be reſolved into form, thus: This is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, on which part the truth ſtands: this is not known by Scripture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſomewhat not known by Scripture is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known; we anſwer, firſt, we deny the ſyllogiſm, becauſe it is not an <hi>Elench,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory ſyllogiſm: for it ſhould conclude ſomething neceſſary to ſalvation which is not known in Scripture: And if this be put into the <hi>major</hi> propoſition, that it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be known, we utterly deny it untill it be well proved; which we think will never be.</p>
            <p>And to that which follows of St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the nineteenth ch. (not the twenty ſecond) <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit. Eccleſiae,</hi> we, conſequently, can eaſily make anſwer, even by ſaying as he, that, <hi>If there were any wiſe man of whom our Saviour had given teſtimony that he ſhould be conſulted in this queſtion, we would make no doubt to perform that he ſhould ſay, leſt we ſhould ſeem not to gainſay him ſo much as to gainſay Chriſt, by whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he was recommended, now Chriſt beareth witneſſe to his Church:</hi> therefore. But what then? What is this to our purpoſe? For firſt, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us what ſhould be done, but not upon what neceſſity, whether to ſalvation or not. In things of queſtion we deny not all due reſpect to the Church: but we are upon things neceſſary to ſalvation; and amongſt ſuch, this point is out of
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:40740:340"/> queſtion no queſtion. But ſecondly, thoſe that ſhould be <hi>conſulted</hi> with, ſhould be believed in proportion to Scripture; ſhould they not? yes, ſurely becauſe Chriſt hath given teſtimony to his Church, in Scripture; and if we are to take the teſtimony of the Church from Scripture, then are we to give credence to what is ſaid in ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie to Scripture: Now though it be not <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and evidently read</hi> in Scripture, as he ſays: yet there may be ſome ſeeds as it were, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of it, whereupon the Concluſion might riſe. And therefore where Scripture hath the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, we give belief to the Concluſion in reſpect thereunto. Yea, the prime and formall reaſon of believing the Church muſt come from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which there in that book, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth prove the Catholick Church: ſo that if the Church be credible by the Scripture, then the Scripture is more credible. But thirdly, this is ſaid by the Father of the Catholick Church, not of a part of it: and therefore they cannot conclude from hence to the Roman Church. For it being underſtood of the whole Church, as ſuch; a part as a part hath no part in it, but as it agrees to the whole. Neither is it ſaid of the Catholick Church for place then, but alſo the Catholick for time: and yet if for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick then, we cannot equally draw it to the Catholick for place now; for the Catholick morally was more credible then than now. And fourthly, as he hath excepted againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding unto all points from the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding one: ſo we, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> deny that he can conclude from the Church unto all points, becauſe St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſeth it for one point againſt
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:40740:341"/> the Donatiſts. And as he argued from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick againſt the Donatiſts a perverſe part which would have ſalvation onely within their circuit in <hi>Africa:</hi> ſo may we argue from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church againſt the Roman, which will have all ſubject to their Communion, or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And then alſo may we limit that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>Whoſoever refuſeth to follow the practice of the Church doth reſiſt our Saviour himſelfe, who by his testimony commends the Church.</hi> This, reſpecting things of Diſcipline againſt Schiſme, may be good: but what is this to univerſal and abſolute aſſent in point of faith? And it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Catholick Church, as before; not the Romane: or, if it did concern the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then; yet <hi>dato, non conceſſo:</hi> it doth not at all avail to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now.</p>
            <p>As for his diſtinction of uſing this Teſtimony, <hi>Not for the authority of S.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>(with whom I am ſo little ſatisfied) but for the convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> We anſwer, that this is but a flouriſh, yet wiſely made, leſt he ſhould be as well engaged to anſwer the teſtimonies of the Fathers againſt them: I ſay then, that we give more reſpect to the Fathers than indeed they do when they differ from them: and we give as much as the Fathers deſire for themſelves. And why have they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then left ſome practices of the Church: as unction with Baptiſm; ſtanding up in prayer betwixt Eaſter and Whitſontide; Infant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and others? But I ſhall conclude this Number with S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Reaſon, <hi>mutatis mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Whoſoever refuſeth to follow</hi> the Doctrine of Scripture in things neceſſary, <hi>reſiſteth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:40740:341"/> himſelfe, who by his teſtimony commends,</hi> and commands to us the Scripture. Let him think of this who is an <hi>Impugner</hi> of the ſufficiency of Scripture.</p>
            <p>To paſs by his ſuppoſitions of his proofe,<note place="margin">Num. 17.</note> which are already nulled by me: he doth here take notice of my charging him with a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>in adjecto,</hi> for ſaying, we ſhould ſubmit to the infallible Judge, whatſoever Reaſons we have to the contrary: But this he doth not ingenuouſly deliver, as it was delivered by me; and yet, in effect, ſaies nothing to it, but that I do ill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſolid Reaſons grounded in Scripture againſt ſuch a Judge. And this is all he would ſay to make out my charge againſt him of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <hi>in adjecto;</hi> leaving out thoſe words of mine, <hi>for it is impoſſible for us in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to aſſent to that for which we ſee reaſons of Scripture to the contrary, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May I not ſay, that this was not fair dealing? but to let this paſs: if he can yet prove, or any for him, <hi>ſuch a Judge to be the Pillar and Ground of Truth, whoſe tongue is directed by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who directed the Pen of thoſe who writ the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> then indeed I ſhould ſuppoſe that which could not be: but this I deny to be proveable by all the wit of <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore I ſtill hold my ſuppoſition: and yet if this could be made good, I ſhould yield my ſuppoſition; yet I could not reverſe my charge againſt him of the contradiction <hi>in adjecto,</hi> which lies not in the ſuppoſition of Reaſons out of Scripture againſt ſuch a Judge; but in this, that we muſt ſubmit to ſuch a Judge, <hi>whatſoever Reaſons</hi> we have out of Scripture to the contrary: For if there could be any ſuch
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:40740:342"/> Judge proved, there could not be Reaſons out of Scripture to the contrary. And Reaſon out of Scripture will binde beliefe againſt any proof. It would not onely put a demurr againſt proofe, but prevail againſt it: and if the proofe were out of Scripture, then there ſhould be a contradiction in Scripture: for there ſhould be reaſon for ſuch a Judge, and reaſon againſt it; and ſo the Scripture ſhould not be infallible: which they confeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 18.</note>But this not right dealing with what I wrote ſhall not anſwer for the miſuſage of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that he here accuſeth me of; becauſe I ſaid, <hi>If we are by duty to go the way of abſolute obedience to the dictates of the Judge, we muſt then, if he ſays vices are vertues, ſay ſo too, as your Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Bellarmin determins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he makes a calumny; becauſe he thinks it as impoſſible for the Pope to ſay that vices are vertues, <hi>as if God the Father ſhould ſay, ſuch a thing was a vertue, and Chriſt ſhould preach ſuch a thing was a vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It would do well, as he ſaid, to uſe ſoft words and hard arguments; waving therefore his reflexions, we ſay, firſt, the <hi>calumnie</hi> is not in ſaying of him what he ſayes not: but in the miſ-interpretation how he ſpeaks it. And to this we ſay; it is not neceſſary to be a calumny, for, it may be ſpoken of him, as it was ſpoken by him, in way of ſuppoſition, and may be ſpoken of him to be ſpoken by him. And therefore if it was no calumny in the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:40740:342"/> to ſay ſo, it may be no calumny in me to ſay of the Cardinall, that he ſaid ſo. They will think a notionall ſuppoſition makes no ſlander, whoſoever be the ſubject, and whatſoever the predicate; and therefore if he thinks that I muſt ſpeak it of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſlanderouſly, he muſt alſo think that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> might ſpeak it ſo too.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if it were as impoſſible to ſuppoſe any ſuch thing of the Pope, as <hi>that God ſhould ſay ſuch a thing is a virtue, and Chriſt ſhould preach it to be a vice;</hi> Then why hath the Pope ſuch a Council to aſſiſt him? It is well put into more hands for fear of a defectibilitie in one. And if it be ſaid, that this was ſpoken of the Pope only hypothetically to his ſaying ſo, as being aſſiſted with a Council; it is eaſily anſwered, that this is not the Jeſuits opinion, that the Pope is infallible onely with a Council. And by the way, if a Pope be infallible onely with a Council, why did Pope <hi>Clement</hi> ſay, that a Council was always good, but when it medled with the Popes authority? Is there any point more conſiderable than the Popes authority? And is he onely infallible in a Council? and yet is he afraid that this point ſhould be meddled with in a Council? Then he muſt ſuſpect his own cauſe in their opinion.</p>
            <p>Well, and can God err, or can Chriſt err <hi>in precepts, and particular judgements,</hi> as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> confeſſeth in the ſame chap.? <hi>it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd that the Pope ſhould err.</hi> And can God or Chriſt err in commanding any thing <hi>unprofitable, or under too heavy a puniſhment?</hi> It is not abſurd to ſay this of the Pope, although it belongs not
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:40740:343"/> to ſubjects to doubt of this, but ſimply to obey, as he ſays in the ſame chap.</p>
            <p>Nay, if to ſpeak ſo of the Pope, as <hi>Bellarmin ſays,</hi> in way of ſuppoſition, were a ſlander, then <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſlanders the Pope alſo in his ſecond <hi>b. de Rom. Pontif. cap.</hi> 29. <hi>Itaque ſicut licet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistere Pontifici, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, as it is lawfull to reſiſt the Pope invading our body, ſo is it lawfull to reſiſt him invading ſouls, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Commonwealth; and much rather, <hi>Si Eccleſiam deſtruere niteretur,</hi> if he ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deſtroy the Church. Thus he. Then he ſhall defend me: therefore may I be clear of ſlander againſt <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> or he guilty of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt the Pope.</p>
            <p>But then thirdly, put caſe I account it no ſlander againſt the Pope to affirm a poſſibility in him to ſay that vice is virtue. The Conſequence, I hope, is good <hi>ab eſſe ad poſſe,</hi> he hath done ſo, therefore is it poſſible. To command diſobedience to Chriſt, under colour of obedience to him, is to ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that vice is virtue: and this the Pope hath done in the injunction of his dimi-Communion; as before. And let them, before they preſſe this ſlander any further, firſt, help <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to purge the Pope of all thoſe errors in faith, and determinations affirmative againſt Gods precepts negative in point of practice. And when they have done this, then we ſhall be afraid to ſuppoſe a poſſibility, if we cannot find further inſtances of fact. And therefore they ſhall not ſcare us with a charge of calumnie, untill they have ſtrongly aſſerted ſuch an impoſſibility. Indeed <hi>impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:40740:343"/> conditio facit negativam:</hi> we cannot err in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience if we cannot err in commanding; but that he cannot err in commands, is yet <hi>ſub judice,</hi> and not himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Proteſtants do ſay (as I noted) that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and onely the Scripture is left us by Chriſt for our Judge to end all Controverſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is no genuine account of our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They do not aſſert the Scripture to be a Judge in formalities. They ſay there is no need of ſuch a Judge, as Papiſts would have; ſince all neceſſaries unto faith and hope and charity, are ſufficiently delivered in matter and form, without any exigence of ſuch a Judge. And in this they agree with all right Catholicks; not <hi>with Hereticks,</hi> as he would have it. And He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, he may know, as before, have urged the Church for them: and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath dealt with Hereticks by Scripture, and therefore if Hereticks uſe the Scripture, muſt we not? ſince Hereticks urge the Church, by his argument, they muſt not, they know the rule, <hi>Duo cum idem faciunt non est idem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is one thing to uſe Scripture for the proof of ſome points, and another thing to ſay Scripture, and onely Scripture, muſt be the Judge for all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies: To what end then is all you ſay againſt me as againſt one miſliking the uſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is all I have from him in account to five or ſix anſwers I gave him to the charge againſt me, for uſing Scripture as Hereticks do. Thus
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:40740:344"/> eaſily he puts me off. Well, to this put-off, we ſay, firſt, that this diſtinction of his imports a confeſſion of his to uſe Scripture in ſome points; then is not the propoſall of the Church neceſſary to all points? and this is ſome abatement of his former univerſality. Secondly, thoſe points he allows the uſe of Scripture in are neceſſary, as was intimated before, ſince <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth own the Scripture for a rule alſo. And if Scripture doth deliver ſome points neceſſary, <hi>quatenus tae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> then all neceſſaries, as before, neither need theſe neceſſaries be many, as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath obſerved: and <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo in effect, <hi>Certa ſunt in paucis.</hi> The rule of faith uſed by the Fathers was not numerous in particulars. Thirdly, we ſay, not that the Scripture is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judge, much leſſe <hi>for all Controverſies.</hi> And therefore if they will ſtand to what is here ſaid by them, and withdraw that which is not duly ſaid of us, let them take the Counters and caſt up the difference betwixt us. They allow the Scripture in ſome points: we allow the Church in ſome points: they allow the Scripture, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſome points neceſſary, we allow the Church much in points not neceſſary. If they would extend <hi>ſome points</hi> neceſſary, to all points neceſſary (which are not many; we, not upon condition, but freely would give the Church due reverence in points of queſtion, and thus there would be ſoon an end of the Controverſies betwixt us, and in all the world alſo. For all differences do ariſe either in Doctrine or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; (if we take Doctrine as extendible not onely to points of ſimple faith, but alſo to points of practice.) For then the Scripture ſhould rule
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:40740:344"/> us in points of Doctrine: and the Church in point of Diſcipline, unto peace.</p>
            <p>But his fair terms will not grow into a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For he argues, that the Scripture cannot be the Judge of Hereticks, thus. <hi>All Offendors againſt the Law will never be ſo much their own Condemnors as to chuſe, on their own accord, a Judge by whom they know they ſhall clearly be condemned: therefore when we ſee all Offendors againſt God's Law in point of Hereſie, chuſe on their own accord to be judged by Scriptures, it is a manifeſt ſign that they know they ſhall never be condemned clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This diſcourſe in form ſeems an Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem, but in effect is a Syllogiſm, if we take a <hi>minor</hi> out of the conſequent. To the <hi>major</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſay, we are not here to examin what an Offendor would do to ſave his life, but what we ſhould doe to ſave our ſouls. The queſtion is of duty, which we ſhould be judged by. Nay, ſecondly, the Offendor ought morally to refer himſelf to his right Judge notwithſtanding his danger: and in hereſie we offend againſt the fundamentall Law of God in Scripture. For though there be a reſpect to the Church in the common definition of hereſie; yet this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Church doth not conſtitute hereſie, but rather ſchiſm. Hereſie hath in it more of the matter about which the error is. Schiſm hath more of the form in oppoſition to the Church, becauſe it is neither in things clearly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ordinarily: nor in things neceſſary. And ſo his argument from a <hi>manifeſt ſign</hi> ſeems to
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:40740:345"/> be ſuch a ſign that he had no better; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the <hi>minor,</hi> which is couched wiſely in the Conſequent or Concluſion, is alſo in part falſe: for Hereticks have alſo pleaded the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church for themſelves, as hath been ſaid: and by his argument, this is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſign that they cannot clearly be condemned by the Church. And then again ſecondly, to the <hi>minor,</hi> he ſuppoſeth hereticks rationall men, becauſe they do wiſely decline, as he thinks, ſuch a Judge as would clearly condemn them. Well then, they may deſire to be judged by Scripture, not becauſe they cannot be clearly condemned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but becauſe they know that that is the ſtandard whereby their opinions are to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and made good, and becauſe they are to deal with thoſe who know there is no other way of ſolid reviction for the matter of hereſie, but by Scripture. Thirdly, the Adverſaries might have known, that as they have appealed to Scripture, ſo alſo to the Scripture they have been ſent by the Church: ſo St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> dealt with <hi>Maximinus:</hi> ſo St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaid the Nicene Fathers determined againſt the Arrians by Scripture, as before hath been ſaid. If therefore they, who in his opinion ſhould have judged them, judged them by authority of Scripture, then Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Law by which they are to be judged. And then the whole argument will be returned upon them, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> thus, <hi>All Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors againſt the Law of God of their own accord would not chuſe ſuch a Judge by whom they know they ſhall clearly be condemned;</hi> Therefore my Adverſaries who are Offendors againſt the Law of God in Scripture, of their own accord have
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:40740:345"/> no mind to be judged by Scripture: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they chuſe to be judged by the Church, which they interpret to be themſelves: thus, as Hereticks, of their own accord, would be their own Judges: ſo would our Adverſaries with all their hearts; then they <hi>agree with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> And ſo it would poſe him to find any one Heretick; as it would poſe me to find how my Adverſaries Church ſhould be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>falſe gloſſes and interpretations</hi> whereby he thinks Hereticks may evade; why ſhould we again ſay, that notwithſtanding they were dealt with by Law of Scripture, but alſo, ſo there are falſe gloſſes and interpretations of former Councils and later too; elſe how could ſome definitions be ſo ſet down as ſhould pleaſe different parties? And why ſo many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſtill? But is this an argument for Theologie? they may uſe <hi>falſe gloſſes and interpretations,</hi> therefore they are not to be judged by Scripture: as good an argument will ſtarve him, for fear of poiſon in his meat.</p>
            <p>And as for our giving of <hi>ſcope to theſe kind of gloſſes and Interpretations,</hi> it is not ſo, <hi>In maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Libertate minima licentia.</hi> Regular permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſearch the Scriptures is no giving of ſcope to ſuch gloſſes and interpretations; then, if ſo, in ſtead of the Beroeans commendation for ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, we muſt read condemnation. For if Miniſters may not give this libertie, the people ought not to take it.</p>
            <pb n="776" facs="tcp:40740:346"/>
            <p>Neither do I againſt any Council <hi>firmely believe my own particular interpretation</hi> to be true, but by conſequent: becauſe that which is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by me according to lawfull rules, I may judge to be true. And he may allow me a power of diſcourſe upon the propoſitions of Councils; becauſe he, as others, may hold Councils to be fallible in their diſcourſe, but not in the Concluſion. And is not this very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable? Can I be as much aſſured of it as that Jeſus is the Chriſt? And may not I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the antient Fathers againſt the Fathers of Trent?<note place="margin">Trent Hiſt.</note> And did not ſome Divines in the Trent Council complain that ſome determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions croſſed the mindes of the Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
            <p>And now, if they will conſider that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians <hi>upheld an opinion,</hi> which they know <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a lawfull Generall Council,</hi> namely, the firſt Nicene; and alſo that the Arrians knew, and that others ought to know, that nothing, in point of faith, could authentickly be urged but out of Scripture, they may think they have ſatisfaction enough to this Paragraph.</p>
            <p>And may what Chriſt and his Apoſtles have expreſſed, for the uſe of the Cup in the Holy Communion, be extruded; and what the Trent Council determined for the omiſſion not doubted of?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some of our Divines have been charged with too much charitie: but we are now char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a totall want of faith, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope too. Yet we may hope to make his charge nought, and our faith good, but we need not ſay any more than what hath been ſaid, whereunto he hath ſaid as much as comes to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: yet now he diverts hither.</p>
            <p>We muſt ſay therefore again, that this ſhould not be a queſtion betwixt us, how we believe the Scriptures to be the word of God: for this is ſuppoſed betwixt us as the ſubject of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And we ſay, that the ſenſe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is to as much purpoſe as if, when we are at <hi>London</hi> we muſt go back again, becauſe we did not go the new way. As to the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then, we deny it. We do <hi>ground our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this truth upon Divine Revelation,</hi> Yea, moreover we return him his argument in terms, and therefore they have no Divine faith, ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall it is for thoſe to ſpeak moſt who have a mind to cover their own defects. They cannot
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:40740:347"/> 
               <hi>ground their aſſent to this truth upon Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> becauſe they ground it upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church: for they muſt either have an immediate revelation that the Church is infallible; or elſe they muſt ground it upon the general ſum of revealed truth; and that is the Scripture: for as for Tradition, that which is of a particular Church is of no weight, as to this buſineſſe: and univerſall Tradition muſt go upon account of the Church: now then, if they ſay that they have a Revelation immediate, that the Church is infallible in propoſing thoſe books to be Canonical, they make that to be of uſe to them which they deny to us, who have as good reaſon to ſay, that we may as well have an immediate revelation that the Scripture is the word of God: but if they ground their faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome texts of Scripture which concern the Church, then they muſt believe the Scripture for it ſelf. So then either they muſt come to us, or elſe indeed they have no Divine faith.</p>
            <p>And therefore had he no cauſe to be offended with that I ſaid, <hi>that the Canonical books are worthy to be believed for themſelves as we aſſent to prime principles in the habit of Intelligence.</hi> To this he ſays in a parentheſis, <hi>And ſo is the book of</hi> Toby <hi>and</hi> Judith <hi>as well as theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doth he ſay, this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? and doth he not then find fault with the antient Church, who did not, as hath been ſhewn, give equall reverence to theſe, as to the books Canonical? If they be as worthy to be believed as the books Canonical, then they erred in not receiving them
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:40740:347"/> with equall belief: And if they erred, then our Adverſaries are loſt.</p>
            <p>And now as for our aſſent to the Canonicall books in the manner of aſſent to prime princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by the help of the Spirit of God; they are not like to proſper in the abuſe of it. Firſt, it is to be noted, that we are not now to deal with one that denies the Scripture to be the word of God: for to an unbeliever hereof we ſhould uſe other arguments rationally to induce him to a good opinion hereof, but when we are deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Chriſtian what is it that grounds our faith of Scripture, one would think we might ſay, that we are reſolved to a Divine faith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Spirit of God, diſpoſing our aſſent to them as of themſelves worthy to be believed, which is the reaſon of aſſent to prime principles. And therefore ſecondly, we do not ſay, that our aſſent to the Canonical books is by a naturall light, as our aſſent to prime principles; but that our aſſent is made to them by way of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, through the Spirit: the light of the Spirit, as to ſhew us the Scripture to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of belief for it ſelfe, is ſupernaturall: but when that comes, we believe it, as we do prime principles; not by diſcourſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is credible of it ſelf. Faith herein bears more proportion to intelligence than to ſcience: becauſe we do not in faith uſe a reaſon to the act, as we do in ſcience: And this is intimated in the common reading of that text of the Prophet, <hi>Si non crediderint, non intelligent:</hi> if they will not believe they ſhall not underſtand; ſo then, ſince faith is a
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:40740:348"/> ſupernaturall habit, as the School-men, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth infuſe it into us, as being an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit infuſed, as they ſpeak: and this doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to believe the Scripture to be the word of God, as by him indited, And one would think that it is a better ground to believe it to be the word of God, becauſe he ſaith ſo, than to believe it becauſe the Church ſaith ſo: and it is more about, becauſe I cannot believe it upon the account of the Church, but becauſe God gives teſtimony of the Church, and why cannot we then believe God, <hi>teſte ſeipſo.</hi> So all the aſſent we give to them is made upon the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God, which is the center in which all lines of Scripture do meet and terminate.</p>
            <p>Therefore might he have ſpared that which follows, <hi>Have you brought all the infallibility of Chriſtian Religion unto this laſt ground to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by the Socinians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I do not ſee what reaſon we have to lay the foundation of Religion ſo as to pleaſe the Socinian. One who maintained the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cauſe was prejudiced by ſuſpition of being inclined to Socinianiſm: and I am now found fault with for not providing for their ſatisfaction in our principles. Well, but ſecondly, I do not finde that Socinians do abhor this tenure of Scripture. And thirdly, they, to be ſure, do tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the authority of their Church, as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. And therefore this is to be returned home to the Romaniſt.</p>
            <pb n="781" facs="tcp:40740:348"/>
            <p>And alſo upon the former grounds might he have omitted what follows from <hi>[doe you expect,</hi> unto <hi>all that you believe;]</hi> for although the object is to be believed for it ſelf, as a prime principle; yet is there not a naturall light for it: that comes ſupernaturally; and therefore faith is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural habit. But if they would be accounted ſuch <hi>rationall</hi> men in the faith of Scripture, they do deſerve from the Socinian a negative reverence by a poſitive favour to them. But again, how far is that which I have ſaid different from the determination of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> in their fourth ſeſſion, <hi>Scripturae dicuntur perfectae quoad perfectionem eredibilitatis et exactiſſimae veritatis;</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſaid perfect, as in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of credibility, and moſt exact truth. And the perfection of credibility belongs to the firſt principles, which are indemonſtrable. And as thoſe principles have themſelves <hi>immobiliter</hi> unto Sciences, as <hi>Aquinas:</hi> ſo the Scriptures have themſelves unto Divinity. Here we muſt reſt. And if every one doth not believe them to be the word of God upon this account, this doth not derogate from the credibility of the object, thus we ſay, that the Scriptures are the infallible word of God, <hi>is evident of its own ſelf, needing no further proof for the requiring an infallible aſſent</hi> no more than the firſt principles, which are the object of intelligence.</p>
            <p>And alſo therefore upon the premiſſes, that which concludes the number might have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, <hi>Indeed you have brought your whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to as pitifull a caſe as your Adverſaries could wiſh it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="782" facs="tcp:40740:349"/>
            <p>Theſe braving words do not hurt a ſolid cauſe, they are to be returned to the place from whence they came, who hath brought Religion to ſo <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull</hi> a caſe as the Pontifician, who muſt have religion made accomodable to their pride and covetuouſneſs? No caſe of Religion ſo pitifull as uncertainty: no ſuch uncertainty of Religion as with them. For if they ground their Religion upon the determination of Councils, wherein onely Biſhops have their vote, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> his confirmation thereof; no man can, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their principles, be certain whether there be a true Pope, or true Biſhop; as hath been ſaid. Moreover, we can make uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall arguments for the truth of Scripture to be the word of God, as well as they. We can make uſe of extrinſecall arguments better; for we make uſe of the authority of the whole Church, and do give it, in this point, as much reverence as is due thereunto. But therefore, till that which is here ſaid for the ſetling of our faith, be diſproved; and alſo till it be proved, that we do not make uſe of theſe arguments towards our faith of Scripture, becauſe we do not pitch our finall reſolution in them, our ground of faith and of Religion is as good and ſound as theirs; yea, in reſpect of our own ſubjective faith, more. Yea, the Romaniſt might know, that he hath been told, that <hi>Estius</hi> doth differ from them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point? and ſays, that it is not neceſſary to faith to be begotten by the propoſall of the Church, in the third <hi>B.</hi> of ſenten. 23 <hi>diſt.</hi> Yea, alſo <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his Triplication againſt <hi>Whitaker</hi> ſaith, p. 103. <hi>Ego igitur quicquid in haec cauſa Spiritui ſancto tribuendum eſt, pleniſſime aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navi,
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:40740:349"/> &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>I have moſt fully aſſigned what is to be attributed to the Holy Ghoſt in this cauſe, aſſerting theſe two things; both that by faith infuſed alone, or by the teſtimony of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit alone, all faith may be begotten, when it pleaſeth the Spirit of God to teach any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily immediately; and alſo, although ordinarily a thing is delivered by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and authority of the Church, yet no faith doth efficaciouſly follow, without the gift of faith infuſed by God, or without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall teſtimony of the Spirit of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And again the ſame in the next page, to the ſame purpoſe, to clear himſelf of the ſuſpition of giving no more to the Holy Ghoſt in this point than thoſe who put the laſt reaſon of believing in the teſtimony of the Church, he ſays diſertly, <q>
                  <hi>Ego enim, &amp;c.</hi> For I have denied and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the laſt reaſon of believing is to be put in the teſtimony of the Church; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that head, that that laſt propoſition or reſolution [I believe the Church to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Holy Ghoſt.] is not had without the inward gift of faith, or that he who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this, believeth this by a gift of faith and not by humane faith or acquiſit; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon that head, that without any teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church or notice of the Church or of the knowledge of that propoſition [That the Church is governed by the Spirit of God] by the onely Magiſterie of the Spirit of God, one may believe all that is to be believed, as the Prophets and Apoſtles being taught by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God alone, did believe many things,
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:40740:350"/> for from hence it follows invincibly againſt <hi>Durandus</hi> and others, ſince there can be but one formall reaſon of our faith, and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without the teſtimony of the Church, but none can believe without the teſtimony of the Spirit, that the proper and formall reaſon of faith is not the voice of the Church, but muſt be the teſtimony, the Doctrine, the Magiſtery of the Spirit of God.</q> So he. And therefore there is leſſe between <hi>Stapleton</hi> and me; than betwixt my Adverſary and me. When all is done therefore, we muſt come to this of the Father, <hi>Cathedram habet in coelis qui corda docet in terris:</hi> He hath his Chair in Heaven that teacheth hearts on earth; and with the heart man believeth unto ſalvation. <hi>Rom</hi> 10.10.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 21.</note>Therefore in the following number he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to take notice of my differing from others of our own Church in this point: let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with their own men. Let <hi>Bannes</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> agree with <hi>Durand.</hi> or if they cannot be reconciled, let them never hereafter make any difference amongſt our ſelves a prejudice to the cauſe. It is then no more reproach to me to differ from others, than for ſome of them.</p>
            <p>As for the three then, whom he ſays, I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cowell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker;</hi> if they do not agree it, it is no infallible argument againſt me even in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe three, But alſo, as to the firſt, I ſay, and my Adverſaries might have known, that he held not faith in the high notion of a
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:40740:350"/> Divine aſſent, as they do: But that a morall aſſurance was ſufficient to it, and ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxive into neceſſary practice. And therefore having this opinion of faith, he conceived no ſuch need of an infallible ground hereof, but took therefore a common principle for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive hereof, namely, univerſal tradition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if he takes not his grounds from my Adverſaries, what do they get by him? For in his ſixty ſixth page, he ſays, that it is <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to</hi> him <hi>that the Goſpell of St.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew <hi>is the word of God, as that all that</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church ſays is true.</hi> Yea, moreover the ſame p. 135. doth fairly ſhew that <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> may give aſſurance hereof, which he ſays indeed, is not rationall and diſcurſive, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall and infuſed. An aſſurance it may be to himſelf, but not to any other: and again, p. 211. that <hi>the Doctrine</hi> it ſelf is very fit and worthy to be thought to come from God, <hi>Nec vox hominem ſonat.</hi> And is not then in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; If then he had raiſed faith to that height of a Divine aſſent, as my Adverſaries do, it is very like he would have thought better of this aſſurance by the Spirit to be more ordinary; ſince univerſal tradition, if it hath any weight, muſt reſt in Scripture, as it is the tradition of the univerſal Church, (which alſo he contradiſtinguiſheth not onely to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church for place, but to the preſent uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church for time) becauſe we cannot prove the Church but by Scripture.</p>
            <p>And as for the other two whoſe judgements he oppoſeth to my opinion, I think they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:40740:351"/> convenient ſatisfaction by what is ſaid to the former: that they did not deny this aſſurance by the Spirit of God, but that it is not argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative to others. And therefore as to the queſtion about the ſufficiency of Scripture, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſays, that this is to be ſuppoſed, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the word of God. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he thinks this is not to be proved by it ſelf, yet in his firſt book. 34. p. he ſpeaks enough, in that he ſays, the Scriptures do ſufficiently direct us to ſalvation. And he quotes for it <hi>Sotus</hi> in the margent. And if it ſufficiently directs us to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then muſt it be ſufficiently clear of it ſelf that it is the word of God: for otherwiſe, the principal point unto ſalvation muſt be known otherwiſe. And if they think to argue well, that we muſt have all faith from the authority of the Church, becauſe we have the faith of the Scriptures from the Authority of the Church, we may as well conclude, that ſince we have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient direction to ſalvation from the Scripture, we are alſo ſufficiently directed to this main point of faith from the Scripture, that the Scripture is the word of God. Yea more; the Scripture doth give better evidence of it ſelf to be the word of God, than the Church can give teſtimony, of it ſelf, to be infallible: becauſe the Church as ſuch, in religion, is a <hi>non ens</hi> without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the ſubſtance of it. But to make an end of this exception againſt me in varying from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; this is the common Proteſtant principle; or elſe <hi>Stapleton</hi> was decieved, who makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that every one of us <hi>ad unum</hi> do hold the Scripture to be known <hi>per ſe et ſua quadam luce propria.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Analſiy principionem.</note> Therefore if the queſtion be how we are
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:40740:351"/> privately aſſured ultimately that the Scripture is the word of God, we ſay, with <hi>Stapleton,</hi> that we are aſſured hereof by the teſtimony of the Spirit: if the queſtion be how we prove it to others to be the word of God, we can, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall proof, make uſe with Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> of univerſal tradition.</p>
            <p>His exception then againſt our private aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Scripture to be the word of God, in his following words, comes to nothing: for we need not, from what we have ſaid, ſay, that the aſſent of faith is evident, as to an object of ſenſe: but yet the aſſent may be more firm and certain. The formall object of faith is inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: yet may we more faſtly hold to what we believe than to what we ſee, becauſe what we ſee <hi>depends upon our fallible ſenſe:</hi> but what we believe, hath an <hi>infallible ground,</hi> namely, the word of God, that this is his word. For this ultimately muſt ſettle our perſonall faith: or elſe we have no faith, of proper name which is infallibly grounded: All believe that what God ſays is true: but if to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether God ſays this, God cannot bring his own teſtimony, there can be no authentick ground of Religion <hi>in ſubjecto.</hi> And thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who would not have died to bear witneſs to a thing of ſenſe, have died to bear teſtimony to the Chriſtian Religion: and alſo have died for it, aſſuredly, <hi>ex vi habitus,</hi> by the power of the habit of faith, not <hi>ex vi traditionis,</hi> by the credibility of the Church.</p>
            <p>And as to that, which he takes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tice of, that I acknowledge a <hi>greater neceſſity of ſuch a Church
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:40740:352"/> to declare by infallible authority which books be the true word of God, which not, than to declare any other point:</hi> I anſwer, that it is not very ingenuouſly taken here by him, what I ſaid; for I ſpake by way of ſuppoſition, that it would not follow, if the Church were infallible as to propoſe, or tax and conſign Canonical books, (as <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſpeaks) yet that we had need of the Church infallibly to propoſe every other point of faith. He, it ſeems, took poſitively, what was ſpoken upon ſuppoſition. Every thing which is given in diſcourſe is not granted to him: but this he refers to num. 43.</p>
            <p>For the ending then of this Paragraph, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for the Controverſie, upon the whole matter, it remains, that the Scripture muſt be credible for it ſelf, or elſe the Church. Not the Church, that muſt be known by the Scriptures, as before, therefore thoſe texts by which the Church is proved in the truth and infallibility, muſt be worthy to be believed for themſelves, or not: if ſo, then why not other parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſo we have our purpoſe? if not, then are we in a circle; and muſt beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and never be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 22.</note>Here another argument is drawn againſt me from the effect negatively; which, in the kind of it, doth not conclude, <hi>A non eſſe ad non poſſe non valet.</hi> And we may as well argue, that ſome have this way attained faith; therefore this is the way: however, the poſſibility proceeds from the effect to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Pighius</hi> and <hi>Hermannus</hi> have not found aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance this way, therefore this is not the way for finall aſſurance, is inconſequent. Secondly, the cauſe of non-aſſurance thus, doth not ariſe from the defect in Scripture, (which <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſays, and ſome others is true and holy and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick) but God doth not give by his Spirit faith to all. All men have not faith; as the Apoſtle, as commonly we expound it, and though they are ſaid to believe in the ſenſe of the Church becauſe they profeſſe the Chriſtian Religion: yet by an internall act of faith many not. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither are we bound to maintain this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of theirs, <hi>Facienti quod in ſe eſt datur gratia ex congruo;</hi> and therefore, if upon the uſe of means, they have not this Divine faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, it is no prejudice to our cauſe: for not onely gifts are <hi>gratiae gratis datae,</hi> but alſo the <hi>gratiae gratum facientes</hi> are alſo freely given: and therefore is their diſtinction, by the way, faultie. And therefore, if there be <hi>many millions</hi> (which is yet more than he could know) <hi>who can truly and ſincerely proteſt before God, and take it upon their ſalvation, that they are wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the reading theſe books to come to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſurance that this is Gods word;</hi> This inferrs nothing of moment againſt us, becauſe, although we have not ordinarily the effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means, yet becauſe we uſe the meanes therefore neceſſarily we ſhall have the effect, doth not follow, if the graces of God be free. Yea, fourthly, thoſe millions he means are of their Church, we may ſuppoſe: and they, we may think, are inſtructed to find no reſolution but in their own way, by the propoſall of the
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:40740:353"/> Church: So that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <q>of the Jews, that they going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God:</q> ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may we ſay of theſe, that they going about to eſtabliſh the authority of the Church in this point, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God. Yea, fifthly and laſtly, (to be even with him in kind) it is ſaid in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that for ſome time in the Church, ſome books were doubted of: now let me aſk how came the Chriſtians afterwards to be aſſured of thoſe books to be alſo Canonicall? Not by the former Church; for they doubted thereof: not by the latter Church; that was impoſſible. How then came the Chriſtians firſt to be perſwaded of thoſe books to be alſo authentick? If it be ſaid by the preſent Church; we ſuppoſe a time before the Church then was thereof aſſured. Yea, if it be ſaid, that private Chriſtians were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reſolved by a Council, we ſay that ſome were aſſured of books, before doubted of, before there was any General Council: Yea, how came thoſe of the Council (upon the ſuppoſition) to be ſo determined of them? It will be ſaid by them, that they were aſſured by the Spirit of God; then, as <hi>Stapleton's</hi> argument is, ſince there is one formal reaſon of faith, the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution muſt be by the Spirit.</p>

We ſay not ſo. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall objects are not ſeen by natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for then what needed the teſtimony of their Church? The object is fair; were the faculty fit. The Spirit of God doth not relate to the object directly, but to the faculty enlightning it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Metaphyſicks: and much more therefore is our minde unable to look up upon that which is not only removed from ſenſe, but alſo from reaſon: therefore is the apprehenſive power raiſed by the Spirit of God to make a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the faculty and the object: and the difficulty of apprehenſion is more from the weakneſſe of the faculty than the ſublimity of the object: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if an Heathen or Turk or Jew were by the Spirit of God inlightned, he would by reading of the Scripture have ſuch an eye as might diſcern the Scriptures to be the word of God. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo neither can any one by reading of the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Councils ſee that they are the word of God. Hath God provided better for their clear converſion by the voice of the Church than by his written word? Doth the Turk and Jew run to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as naturally as the Lamb to the dam? Doth the Jew think he hath reaſon to recieve the Scripture from the Roman, as to the old Teſtament? Or doth he not think that the Roman ſhould take the Bible from him? and therefore, in courſe, the Jew is ſaid to offer it the Pope, as he goes to his Palace.</p>
            <pb n="792" facs="tcp:40740:354"/>
            <p>
               <hi>If this were true, it is impoſſible thouſands ſhould not be yearly converted by this means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, if the Roman could help it: for he would not ſuffer them to have the common uſe of the Bible, yea alſo may we ſay the ſame, if they could not but believe by the knowledge of the Church at firſt ſight. Yea, ſurely the reaſon why ſo few of them doe believe, is not becauſe they are not diſpoſed to believe by reading of the Scripture, but becauſe they are not diſpoſed to read them.</p>
            <p>This effect indeed he vaunts is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>by the Preachers of the Church:</hi> who <hi>have found the concurrence of Gods grace to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is well that they have ſo good reaſon to magnifie preaching: and yet this action is not by their great ones ſo highly eſteemed; and this practice I think they took from their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who had the firſt fruits of this office: and therefore if it be ſo; the argument is avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as well to them. But ſecondly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was not, it ſeems, <hi>ex vi miniſterii;</hi> but by the <hi>concurrence of Gods grace:</hi> and ſurely the concurrence of Gods grace is ſufficient to converſion by reading. But thirdly, if the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of their Church (as <hi>Xavier</hi>) with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Gods grace did convert millions, then I hope infallibility may be even in private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; or elſe we have no need of infallibility in order to converſion.</p>
            <pb n="793" facs="tcp:40740:354"/>
            <p>But he ſuppoſeth that <hi>reading of the Scriptures alone did never find the concurrence of Gods grace to convert any ſingle man (that we could hear of.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> More may be done than they know: and more may they ſay of their Preachers than was done. Secondly, were their Preachers Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church <hi>objective?</hi> If ſo, then they had other denominations than did become them who had a mind to follow the Apoſtles, who rather commended Chriſt to the Church, than the Church to Chriſtians. Yea; if St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5. ſays, <q>We preach not our ſelves, but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake;</q> how could they preach themſelves or the Roman Doctors to be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their faith, and the Roman Church not onely to be the Mother, but Miſtriſſe of the Chriſtian world? Thirdly, if any did believe by them, they did not believe for them, and therefore was not their authority the ground of their faith: nay, not the authority of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church; for that can have no greater authority than St. <hi>Paul</hi> had: and what ſaid he of himſelf, 1 Ep. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.

               </gap>. And fourthly, is not reading of the word an ordinance of God? and therefore was the Law read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day, and is there any ordinance of God with which he doth not at all concur? though he is not bound to it: yet he doth it gratiouſly. Yea, fiftly, was not <hi>Junius</hi> converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith by reading of the firſt Chapter of
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:40740:355"/> St. <hi>John, with the concurrence of God's grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>N. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. In all theſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes the ſame diſcourſe, againſt the clearneſſe of the Scripture to be the word of God by its own light. And all the arguments therein do, in effect, hang upon one ſtring; which is a ſuppoſition, that we ſhould hold this principle, of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's being the word of God, to be as clearly aſſented to by a natural faculty, as a principle of Science. Only in the 29. number he doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt the help of the Spirit to ſee the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be credible for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>That ſuppoſition we have already taken away: and ſo the ſtring being broken; all thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt fall, yet what in them is new and of moment I ſhall touch and remove.</p>
            <p>As to the want of ſuffrages from the Antients for my opinion in this point, which he chargeth it with in his twenty fourth Par. I ſay no more than that I have ſaid more than he had any mind to make any anſwer to; the reaſon whereof I have given before.</p>
            <p>And as to his imagination, that if the Fathers had perſwaded the Heathens to believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by its own light, they would have <hi>ſcoffed at them,</hi> we have anſwered before, that we uſe not ſuch an argument to perſwade others: but this we have for our private aſſurance, as we cannot aſſent to Chriſtian Doctrine but by the Spirit (for <hi>no man can ſay Jeſus is the Lord but by the Spirit;</hi>) ſo no man can give a Divine aſſent to the books
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:40740:355"/> of Scripture, but by the Spirit, as <hi>Stapleton</hi> hath affirmed: therefore though we cannot argue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the reception of theſe books as Canonical by that inward teſtimony of the Spirit, which we cannot make known to others infallibly; yet ſurely we may be able to prove to the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, at leaſt, that there is ſuch a teſtimony of the Spirit of God <hi>in theſi:</hi> they will not argue from the deniall of it <hi>in Hypotheſi</hi> to private Chriſtians, to the deniall of it <hi>in univerſali:</hi> for they ſay that the Church which is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe books to private men (if they think they are to be commended to them) is aſſured, that they are books Divine and Canonical, by the teſtimony of the Spirit: ſo that, upon the point, we agree for the kind of aſſurance, and they come to us for the laſt aſſurance: onely they will have us to have this aſſurance mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Church. So the whole <hi>ratio</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Papiſt is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, delivered by <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, Dei verbum per os Eccleſiae intelligimus;</hi> both the faith of the Scripture, and faith out of the Scripture we muſt have it from the Church. And yet the Church Repreſentative muſt have it ſeverally from the Spirit immediately too: and ſo there is leſſe difference. And yet there was no Council or Pope ſurely for the firſt three hundred years; in which time notwithſtanding men did believe the Scriptures to be the word of God; and then no difference betwixt them and us in the perſwaſion of Canonical Scripture. Secondly, <hi>Dato non conceſſo,</hi> that there had been nothing ſaid by the Fathers touching this point (which yet, as before, is not ſo) yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not we argue from them negatively as we doe
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:40740:356"/> from Scripture; becauſe even the chief of their Doctors will ſay, that the Scripture is a rule of faith, and the principal one too, ſome: but ſo is not the conſent of the Fathers with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts <hi>in communi,</hi> (for they will differ from them as they did in the Trent Council) and ſpecially with my Adverſary who hath, before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed the Fathers to the authority of the Church. So then, as we cannot ſolidly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from their uſe of arguing from the Church, that there is no better aſſurance abſolutely; ſo neither could we from the ſilence of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Spirit, argue, that we muſt only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Church. But thirdly, he might have obſerved in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the reaſon why they urged the authority of the Church for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Scripture, in <hi>lib. de utilitate cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Scripturae populariter accuſari poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt, non poſſunt populariter defendi,</hi> namely, otherwiſe than by the Church: yet he alſo doth ſuffragate for us in his book againſt the Epiſtle of the <hi>Manich. Non jam hominibus ſed ipſo Deo intrinſecus mentem noſtram firmante atque illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minante;</hi> not men now, but God himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and inlightning our mind within. And for triumph, <hi>Caniſius</hi> and <hi>Hoſius</hi> (beſides <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>) of the Romaniſts are brought in with their teſtimonies to the ſame purpoſe, that we have a greater teſtimony of the Scriptures than the Church,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Whit. De Eccleſ.</hi> p. 254.</note> namely, that of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>As for that which follows, <hi>Really I think if the Doctors of the Primitive Church had told the Heathens, &amp;c.</hi> to the end of the Paragraph, how little doth it weigh with us. <hi>Really</hi> we may
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:40740:356"/> think that they think any thing will ſerve to make up weight. We can uſe, to ſuch, the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with the Fathers without any derogation to our cauſe. And ſecondly, they did not plead the Church upon the Roman account: and therefore, if they will have all, they have no ſhare. But to ſerve them in kind: Did the Doctors of the primitive Church tell the Heathens of our ordinary Paſtor, which ſhould be the Plenipotentiarie of the whole Church? Did they tell them of Tranſubſtantiation? And had they told them that theſe things were as credible by the authority of the Church as by <hi>a light as evident as the Sun, the Heathens</hi> ſurely <hi>would have ſcoffed at them for ſaying</hi> them <hi>to be ſo viſible.</hi> And again he argues from the viſibility to the actuall ſight, not conſidering what is requiſit in the ſubject, namely, facultie and will.</p>
            <p>This number is <gap reason="foreign">

But then why were theſe accounted amongſt the reſt Deuterocanonical? why were they not accounted by <hi>Jerom,</hi> by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> by <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> (as before) equal to the books Canonical, as to confirmation of faith? Why rejected by ſo many learned men, as Doctor <hi>White</hi> in his Defence of the true way doth cite, p. 32? Well. And how came the firſt Chriſtian to diſtinguiſh them? Not by the authority of the Church: then by ſome difference in the books by the Divine illumination. For ſecondly, the Church
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:40740:357"/> hath not, as to the Canonicallneſſe of books, <hi>vim operativam,</hi> but <hi>vim declarativam,</hi> as at moſt, even according to their greateſt Doctors: and therefore this they do not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <hi>ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio:</hi> then either they were not declared in the primitive times, or were declared by ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination from the books: if they were not declared, there is no neceſſity now neither that they ſhould be declared; if they were declared upon reaſon of the difference, then there are not ſuch <hi>raies</hi> in the books Apocryphall. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if theſe books were allways to be received as Canonicall, then the Church in the Primitive times erred in not receiving them. If they be not to be received as Canonicall, as they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo, then the Roman Church erreth in the receiving them for ſuch. And this <hi>Dilemma</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of their infallibility.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Num. 26.</note>A ſixth argument is drawn from a poſſibility of ſome omiſſion of ſome words in Scripture, <hi>as the little word [not,]</hi> to an impoſſibility of my diſcerning <hi>this omiſſion only by the reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Scripture is either corrupted or not. If the former, how can we truſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which pretends it ſelf the Keeper: if not, the argument is void, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> holds the latter. Secondly, <hi>Conditio impoſſibilis facit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativam:</hi> if it were falſe it could not be the word of God: therefore ſince we both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be the word of God, we cannot, <hi>ut ſic,</hi> ſuppoſe ſuch an omiſſion. Thirdly, if there were a [not] left out, how ſhould the Church
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:40740:357"/> have power to put it in? For then the Church would have power to contradict the old read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo to make Scripture: if the Church had not power, then it would be as uncertain as we. Fourthly, if there were a [not] left out in things ſubſtantiall and neceſſary, it would likely make a contradiction to other texts where the ſame matter is delivered (for it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to find ony point neceſſary to be one of thoſe which are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) now ſince we both conclude no Contradiction in Scripture (for then it would not be true and infallible) we do <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> conclude that there is no ſuch <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> Fifthly, if we may he perſwaded by the Spirit of God, that the Scripture is the word of God, then conſequently we are aſſured that there is <hi>not</hi> ſuch an <hi>omiſſion:</hi> but <hi>verum prius, ergo poſterius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have a ſeventh argument,<note place="margin">Num. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Luther</hi> who <hi>had the Spirit as well as</hi> I, <hi>if not in a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, contradicts</hi> me in the Canonicallneſſe of <hi>the Epiſtle of St. James and in ths book of the Revelation;</hi> therefore this ground of believing Canonicall books is fallible: ſince in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction one part muſt be falſe. And thus he thought to pay me in kind for my diſputing the error of Councils by a Contradiction; which, he ſays, <hi>If you could prove, you ſhould prove, that Councils are fallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for the Metaphyſicall Law in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, that one part muſt be <hi>falſe,</hi> if we hold any thing certainly true, we differ not.</p>
            <pb n="800" facs="tcp:40740:358"/>
            <p>And concerning the proof of Councils to be fallible by ones contradicting another, it comes in here but collaterally; this is not <hi>ſedes mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae:</hi> and therefore as he brings it in we may paſſe it with a light foot.</p>
            <p>In point of fact they will confeſſe they may as well contradict one another, as err.: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will not now inſiſt upon the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Nice</hi> about the Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas.</hi> But did not the Council of <hi>Francford</hi> contradict the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> in point of worſhip of Images? But alſo to give them <hi>exemplum utile;</hi> the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> rejected the Apocryphal books, as not Canonical: the Council of Trent receives them for ſuch, Seſ. 4. So one contradicts another. And if it be ſaid that the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was not Generall; we anſwer, that it was as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth below for he book of <hi>Maccabees:</hi> for this was but provinciall, by <hi>Carranza's</hi> confeſſion. But then ſecondly, we ſay, though it was but provinciall, yet was it eſtabliſhed by the ſixth Generall Council, as <hi>Carranza</hi> alſo confeſſeth; and then conſequently, the ſixth Generall Council and the Council of Trent do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</p>
            <p>And now as to the contradiction betwixt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and me upon the caſe, I ſay firſt, that the argument is not yet valid to his purpoſe; the objects have themſelves equally to all: but all have themſelves not equally to objects: and yet, though <hi>Luther</hi> had a greater <hi>meaſure</hi> of the
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:40740:358"/> Spirit than I, it doth not follow nevertheleſſe, that this book could not be ſeen to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine by the Divine illumination; no more than it doth follow, that becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a greater meaſure of the grace of God's Spirit, he could not deny his Maſter. As a larger meaſure of grace doth not exclude all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſin; ſo neither doth a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Spirit exclude all poſſibility of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Secondly, was not the Church of Chriſt as quick-ſighted, by the help of the Spirit, before the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as then? And yet it ſeems by my Adverſary, that the Church did not clearly propoſe the book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> to be Canonicall before that time: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore non-acknowledgement in ſome doth not prove againſt poſſibility of certain knowledge. And thus, if <hi>Luther's</hi> exceptions againſt thoſe books were always continued in the height of termes (which yet is denied) he gaines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt us, ſince alſo, Thirdly, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Adverſary his own argument, if the determinations of the Church be ſo clear, how doe they contradict one another?</p>
            <p>Next follows the inſtance he puts of thoſe two prime Doctors of the Church, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> about the book of <hi>Maccabees.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as he would have us think, held it for Canonicall: St. <hi>Jerom</hi> not. So then, here is Father againſt Father: and therefore conſent of Fathers in all points is ſcarce a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument. But the cauſe, he ſays, of this difference was not our ground, (this we have ſpoken to) but becauſe it was not clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:40740:359"/> in St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> time by the Church, <hi>But the third Council of</hi> Carthage <hi>(in which St</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin <hi>was preſent) declared theſe books to be God's word, and ſo St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>held theſe books in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to be God's word, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not to paſſe it, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> might be more likely to ſwallow the account of theſe books, becauſe he had not ſkill in the Hebrew Canon, as the Greek he learned late. And not to paſſe it, that my Adverſary names not the place where St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> held theſe books to be God's word, and infallibly too: it may be he held them ſo as the book of Wiſedom, of which before: but my Adverſary ſpeaks one word here ingenuouſly, that the third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> did but <hi>declare:</hi> well, and the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> did before <hi>declare</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This was before St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time, being celebrated in the year 364. as <hi>Carranza</hi> reckons: and the reaſon then, why St. <hi>Jerom</hi> refuſed that book, was not becauſe he had <hi>not ſeen this Council of Carthage,</hi> as my Adverſary ſays, but becauſe he had read the Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Laodicea:</hi> for this was of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to that of <hi>Carthage;</hi> being both provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall; and both confirmed by the ſixth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Council, as the former Author obſerves: and if ſo, then, by the way, the ſame Generall Council was guilty of a Contradiction, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing the Canons of thoſe Councils, which in this point about the books of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> are repugnant one to other. Again, if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> did bind St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (who ſubſcribed it) as to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of theſe books for Canonicall; then
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:40740:359"/> the twenty ſixth Canon of the ſame Council doth equally bind, <q>That the Biſhop of the firſt ſea ſhould not be called the Prince of the Prieſts, or the ſupreme Prieſt, or any ſuch thing, but onely the Biſhop of the firſt ſea.</q> Therefore let the Roman either not urge this Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, or receive it againſt himſelf. Nay, laſtly, we can better anſwer the Canon againſt us than <hi>Carranza</hi> anſwers the Canon againſt <hi>Rome's</hi> Supremacy. For, the reaſon which my Adverſary gives out of the Canon for reception of thoſe books, doth not oblige to receive them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to Canonical books, namely, <hi>becauſe we have received from our Fathers, that they were read in the Church.</hi> The ſtrength of this reaſoning is reſolved into this propoſition, Whatſoever is read in the Church is to be taken for Canonical: and this propoſition is falſe by the practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: yea, alſo by the Canon it ſelf, for it ſayes, <hi>Liceat etiam legi paſſiones Martyrum, cum anniverſarii dies eorum celebrantur:</hi> Itmay be lawfull alſo to read the paſſions of the Martyrs, when their anniverſary days are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated. And alſo if that reaſon did bind the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> to eſtabliſh them as Canonical, why did it not as well bind St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in whoſe time the books alſo were read, if they were univerſally read? And if the Church of God was ſufficiently inſtructed in point of faith without them till St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time (which was above four hundred years after Chriſt, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth) why may not the Church be well enough without them ſtill? For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there muſt be nothing in them materiall or
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:40740:360"/> expoſitionall, which is ſimply neceſſary for Gods Church: or elſe the Church of God for the pureſt and beſt times muſt be unprovided there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as Canonically to ground faith. If they confeſſe the former, we have what we would: if the latter, beſides other conſequences, they deſtroy the rule of faith to Councils themſelves; or as ſome now will ſay, by ſucceſſion of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Therefore by this inſtance he gets nothing, it is neither <hi>proof</hi> nor <hi>diſproof.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Num. 28.</note>Here he triumphs before the victory, he doth here put a new face upon an old argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>If you ſay that we muſt have a ſpeciall Spirit (that is new eyes) to ſee it, then you who have this Spirit are all Prophets, diſcovering, by private Revelation made to your ſelves, that which all mankind beſides could not and cannot diſcover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This argument prophylactical preſerves them little: A ſpeciall Spirit is conſiderable two ways; either in <hi>ordine ad ſubjectum,</hi> or <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad objectum:</hi> it may be ſpeciall in the firſt ſenſe; and not in the latter: Now it is the ſpeciall Spirit in the latter ſenſe which makes the Prophet; when ſome new thing is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: thus we deny any ſpeciall Spirit; which rather belongs to them who will not have all things for neceſſary faith and manners revealed in Scripture, that ſo they may find in the Church, by tradition, the points of their Religion which they cannot find in Scripture; as is noted. But alſo the ſpeciall faith in the firſt ſenſe may be ſubdiſtinguiſhed; it is conſiderable either as
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:40740:360"/> oppoſitly to thoſe who have not faith; or reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively to thoſe who have faith: in the firſt way, we ſay it is ſpeciall; for all men have not faith, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2. but if it be taken reſpectively to thoſe who have faith, we ſay it is not ſpeciall; but common: for there is no true dogmaticall faith but ſuch; as <hi>Stapleton</hi> and their Schoolmen confeſſe. Yea, this argument may be returned to them too, if they ſay they are inlightned by the Spirit to ſee all truth infallibly to be delivered by the Church, they have the <hi>new eyes;</hi> and they <hi>are all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, diſcerning by private revelation made to</hi> them <hi>ſelves that which all mankind beſides could not</hi> diſcover. So then the other old argument, which here he incruſtates, that if the evidence of Scripture to be the word of God were ſuch as of a prime principle, as this <hi>[It is impoſſible that any thing ſhould be and not be in the ſelf ſame circumſtances]</hi> then all ſhould aſſent to it, as they do to this principle, is again ſlighted: for firſt, every one hath not that ſupernaturall light or eye to ſee the truth of that firſt principle, that the Scripture is the word of God; which we have ſaid before: but then ſecondly, the prime principle in Metaphyſicks are not ſo clear as to exclude all neceſſity of means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, though they do naturally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade aſſent: ſo there are means of knowing the Scripture, which do not prejudice their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topiſty through the Spirit of God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there may be a failing of belief. Yea, thirdly, the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, <hi>John</hi> 3.8. Yea, fourthly, many truths are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as he ſaid, which are
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:40740:361"/> not prophorically acknowledged. And yet ſome of their own men have confeſſed this truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome by the ſoveraignty of it. Fifthly, it is retorted, if the authority of the Church were the prime principle for the evidence of faith, then all would aſſent to it: but all doe not aſſent to it: therefore by his own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Church's authority is not the prime principle.</p>
            <p>But the aſſiſtance of the Spirit he then pleads <hi>a fortiori</hi> for the Church, <hi>the Church having far more proof of her aſſiſtance than every private Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, we have no to need be put upon the compare with the Church. If the Church have infallible aſſiſtance herein: yet private Chriſtians may have it too; and that would be ſufficient for us in this point. But ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Church is no otherwiſe infallibly certain hereof than we: for this is aſſured to every one that votes it in the Council, the ſame way; if indeed they doe give their ſuffrage upon a ground infallible. Thirdly, the private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is aſſured hereof by the Spirit for himſelf: therefore the Council needs not be infallible herein as to teach it, becauſe we are thus <hi>taught of God.</hi> If the compare were thus, if the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian were thus aſſiſted to teach others, much more the Council, this would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like: but the private Chriſtian doth not undertake this: and yet doth it not follow that this infallibility doth attend the Council which doth undertake to teach others: becauſe there
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:40740:361"/> is uſe of its teaching without infallibility: and no need of its teaching infallibly this point, which we are infallibly perſwaded of by the Spirit of God. And fourthly, we deny that there is any <hi>points of as much conſequence,</hi> wherein the Church ſhould be aſſiſted with infallibility, as this, that the Scripture is the word of God: becauſe, if we be aſſured of this, we need not depend upon any infallibility in the Church for other points, ſince all things neceſſary are with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient plainneſſe ſet down in the Scripture. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as before, the Chriſtians were aſſured here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of before Pope or Council, in which he placeth the authority infallible of the Church. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if the univerſall Church had this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they ſpeak of, they are to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be firſt a true part: and then alſo, that the part hath the property of the whole: and when they have done theſe, we can ſay as much, yea, more for our own Church. And laſtly, they are yet to ſhew their clearer <hi>proofs of aſſiſtance</hi> to the Church, than a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian hath for the <hi>hardeſt of all points:</hi> namely, that the Scripture is the word of God: which indeed, if it be compared with the points of Controverſie in Divinity, is not the hardeſt point: and is therefore aſſured us by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not becauſe it is the hardeſt point, but becauſe it is the ground of all faith. <hi>Perhaps, becauſe our Divines often call the Scriptures, an undoubted principle, the firſt principle, you think they hold this principle like the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Sciences, which are therefore indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable becauſe they are of themſelves as evident as any reaſon you can bring to make them more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="808" facs="tcp:40740:362"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, I had better reaſon for it than the expreſſions of their own Divines, although we need no more, if they in effect confeſſe as much as will ſerve us in the diſpute. But it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them or any other to fix a foot in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity but upon this ground: or elſe we ſhall have no other aſſurance for the laſt reſolution of faith, than what we have in kind for <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil's</hi> or <hi>Cicero's</hi> works. Yea, moreover their own Divines give this character of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe it is true of it: it is not true, becauſe they ſay it: and yet if it were true, becauſe they ſay it: we make uſe of the Concluſion. Or if it be <hi>an unqueſtioned princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe it is already granted to be God</hi>'s <hi>word by all parties,</hi> then why doth my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary call this into queſtion, which is the ſubject of the queſtion, and by <hi>all parties gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi> And alſo this makes it to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principle, that <hi>it is granted by all parties.</hi> And therefore are we to be tryed by it, as by a common principle: and not by the Church, which is not granted by all parties to be that we ſhould be tryed by; ſpecially, if it be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that the Roman Church is the onely Church: for then there will be a double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; one <hi>in theſi,</hi> whether all faith is ultimately to be reſolved by the Church; and then another <hi>in hypotheſi</hi> whether the Roman be the Church.</p>
            <p>But we now put together that which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth, the <hi>Scripture is an undoubted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and the firſt principle, but not as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Sciences which are therefore indemonſtrable,
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:40740:362"/> &amp;c.</hi> We diſcourſe thus, That which is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable <hi>is as the principle of Sciences:</hi> but that which is as <hi>evident as any reaſon</hi> can be brought for <hi>it to make it more evident,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrable; therefore is it as a principle of Sciences. The propoſition is with my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the propertie of the firſt principles in Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Aſſumption is with my Adverſary the very <hi>ratio formalis indemonſtrabilitatis:</hi> ſo then, if the Scripture to be the word of God be as evident as any reaſon that can be brought for <hi>it to make it more evident,</hi> then we have what we now contend for: Now then if the Scripture cannot be demonſtrated to be the word of God by the Church <hi>a priori;</hi> then is it as evident as any reaſon can be brought for it: but <hi>verum prius:</hi> for the Church muſt be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Scriptures, as we have often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And if the Scripture were demonſtrated by the Church <hi>a priori,</hi> then were the Church the cauſe of Scripture; which they themſelves do not ſay: and therefore may we give a <hi>reaſon</hi> of the Church by the Scripture, and not infallibly of the Scripture by the Church; and therefore is it as <hi>a prime principle in Sciences, indemonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet my Adverſary would circumvent me in the next number, and bring me into a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, thinking that I am bound to give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof by the Spirit why by the Spirit I do believe that the Scripture is the word of God: but we ſtop him at firſt before he goes his rounds, for he ſuppoſeth that which is not to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the teſtimony of the Spirit is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:40740:363"/> to make it ſelf good to us of it ſelf, and that therefore we need another <hi>revelation ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from all illuſion,</hi> to aſcertain me the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is little leſſe than trifling: for firſt, we ſay, not this internall teſtimony is prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to others: faith objective is proveable by Scripture; but faith ſubjective is not proved: but ſomewhat ſhewed by a good life: for faith works by love, as St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And <hi>optimus Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſmus bona vita,</hi> as he ſaid, the beſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to others, we have of faith, is a good life. But ſecondly, we are as ſecure of the not being deceived in the teſtimony of the Spirit, as the Apoſtles were in the kind. Yea, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcertained by the ſame teſtimony, then how can the Council be aſſured that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſiſted by the Spirit. Yea, thirdly, we are upon the higher ground for the aſſecuration of our faith, becauſe we reſolve it into that which is antecedent to the Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have they leſſe cauſe to put us upon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories why we believe the Scriptures: for if we do not believe it for it ſelf, we have no reaſon to believe the Church.</p>
            <p>To his <hi>Dilemma</hi> then, <hi>Either I try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit whether it be of God or no;</hi> if I <hi>do not,</hi> how am I <hi>then ſecure? If</hi> I <hi>doe, by what infallible means?</hi> If I ſay <hi>by the Scripture,</hi> you <hi>muſt needs laugh, becauſe you ſpeak of the firſt act of belief, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="811" facs="tcp:40740:363"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We ſay firſt, that he miſapplieth the text of the Apoſtle, <hi>Trie the Spirits:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1.</note> it is not meant of the Spirit of God I hope he thinks, but of the Spirits of men; which is our argument againſt them: and therefore can we not ſit down with abſolute belief to what is propoſed by man till we ſee it center'd upon the word of God, which we believe infallibly came from God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the tryall of the Spirits there injoined is by examining the matter whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the word of faith: but here he draws it to the triall of Scripture it ſelf, which is the rule of triall. Thirdly, though we do not try the teſtimony of the Spirit atteſting to us the truth of Scripture, yet the matter of Scripture may we compare with univerſall tradition; which ſerves us for our uſe in the miniſtry of the Church; not for our faith in the cauſality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to be even with my Adverſaries: we return them their <hi>Dilemma;</hi> they ſay we muſt believe the Scripture to be the word of God by the teſtimony of the Church, which, they ſay, is infallible, but we muſt infallibly know that this teſtimony of the Church is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible by the Spirit of truth, which leads us into all truth. And this cannot be infallibly known but by a <hi>Revelation ſecure from all illuſion.</hi> And how come they <hi>by this revelation? Either</hi> they <hi>try the Spirit or not:</hi> if not, how can they be ſecure? If they doe; by <hi>what infallible means?</hi> If they ſay by the Church, we muſt needs <hi>laugh,</hi> becauſe we ſpeak <hi>of the firſt act of belief,</hi> by <hi>which we firſt begin to believe</hi> the Church <hi>to be
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:40740:364"/> infallible.</hi> Therefore all his <hi>agains</hi> are ſent back again: and the iſſue of all will come to this; either this faith of the Scripture to be the word of God muſt be reſolved into the teſtimony of the Spirit, or of the Church: not of the Church, becauſe the teſtimony thereof is reſolved into Scripture, of which the queſtion is, yea, if the teſtimony of the Church were infallible, it muſt be infallibly proved by the Scripture; and alſo that it is our rule of faith. But thus we ſee the importunity of the Pontifician for their cauſe: if we ſhould ſay we reſolve our faith of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into the teſtimony of the Church, they would never aſk us a reaſon of our faith: but when we ſay we reſolve it into the internall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Spirit for our own private aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they will not let us ſit down with that, but will demand a proof thereof; although the teſtimony of the Church, if it were the formall reaſon of our faith muſt be infallibly made good to us by the internall teſtimony of the Spirit, but that which they would have us reſt in for the Church, we may not reſt in for the Scripture. And yet alſo have we other arguments from Scripture it ſelf which have more moment in them unto the belief of Scripture, than the meer teſtimony of the Church, as Dr. <hi>White</hi> notes in the twenty ſixth p. of the way to the true Church which is worthy to be peruſed alſo upon this account, that there are ſeverall teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies collected even of Papiſts for the belief of Scripture without dependence upon the Church: as of <hi>Caniſius, Bellarmin, Biet, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> of <hi>Valence, Stapleton;</hi> ſome whereof we have quoted allready. So then by my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:40740:364"/> own argument, if we need not depend upon the Church for belief of Scripture; then not for other points of faith.</p>
            <p>The thirtieth Article hath nothing in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable but for us, firſt, that he ſaith it to be <hi>that moſt fundamentall Article, that ſuch and ſuch books be infallibly God's word.</hi> So then if it be <hi>the moſt fundamentall article,</hi> then it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fundamentall to the Church: otherwiſe it is not <hi>that moſt fundamentall</hi> article, but the Church muſt be the moſt fundamentall article. And if it be fundamental to the Church, then we reſolve our faith in the higheſt principle, and that which is <hi>primo primum:</hi> and the Papiſts reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into that which is at beſt but <hi>ſecundo primum.</hi> Our faith then being rooted in Scripture, we can give a check to their vaunting of the priviledge of the Church, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did to the Jew; <q>but if thou boaſteſt, thou doſt not bear the root, but the root thee:</q> ſo the Church doth not bear the Scripture, but the Scripture it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, we note in his thirtieth num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what he ſaith, <hi>Take the Church without any infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt and their authority is but humane;</hi> We aſſume: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance is not yet proved; and till it be proved, the authority is but humane: and yet doe we not <hi>ſcoff</hi> at the authority of the Church, as he chargeth us: but do make good <hi>uſe</hi> of it without infallibility.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, we might note that if ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the anſwering of theſe papers he might tell them that they are mendicants of the queſtion:
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:40740:365"/> for firſt, here they ſay, that they <hi>ground this point upon the authority of the Church as being infallible.</hi> And then again, <hi>ſhe hath an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible authority, which we account a fanſie:</hi> and yet again, <hi>this infallibility alone muſt be that which groundeth not this perſwaſion but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſent.</hi> And yet again, <hi>take the Church —without any infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt and their authority is but humane.</hi> Theſe things ſo nearly belonging and eſſentially to the queſtion are to be proved, not ſuppoſed: yet all muſt be ſuppoſed by them, that ſo they might not ſeem to run at the ring and hit it, as we may ſpeak, only the laſt hath a truth in it, but alſo it ſuppoſeth in the drift a ſuppoſition for their uſe.</p>
            <p>But at the laſt we have an appearance of an argument, <hi>We have no other infallible ground left us but the authority of the Church aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt ſince the Scripture hath no where revealed which books be Scripture, which not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this we ſay three things: firſt, that the argument is no way cogent, becauſe there is no neceſſity of either, if we can be aſſured by the Holy Ghoſt that theſe books be Canonicall. And if we cannot how did the Church at firſt aſſure it ſelf that they were Canonicall? So then <hi>Omne reducitur ad principium,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s rule is. Secondly, unleſſe they prove the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church better, they had better have left this out; for otherwiſe there is no ground of faith, unleſſe our ground be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:40740:365"/> if this be a true Diſ-junctive propoſition, that either the Scripture muſt ſet down which books be Canonicall, which not, or elſe the Church in the propoſall muſt be infallible. And yet if the Scripture ſhould have ſet down which books were Canonicall, it muſt be reſolved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that book, wherein they were ſet down was Canonicall, by the Holy Ghoſt alſo. Then thirdly, if the disjunctive be not true, then his diſcourſe is falſe: if it be true in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, then we aſſume againſt them that the Scripture hath no where revealed whether the Church is infallible; and therefore there is no other way to know it to be infallible but by it ſelfe: So then it muſt prove the teſtimony of the H. G. by it ſelf: and if it can, then may we prove the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Scripture by it ſelfe: if not, where will they ſet up?</p>
            <p>In the 31. Num. he would ſquat,<note place="margin">Num. 31.</note> and deceive the chaſe by a diſtinction, which will not ſtay him from running round in the proving of Scripture by the Church, and the Church by Scripture. He ſayes, <hi>No Sir, you never heard me give this reaſon, unleſſe it were when I ſpake to one who independently of the Church do profeſſe himſelf to believe the Scripture to be God's word, as you do.</hi> And this is the effect of this Number for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and of thoſe Divines, <hi>who do not deale thus in proving the Church by the Scripture with all thoſe who have not admitted the Scripture as infallible: for they firſt prove the authority of the Church (and that independently of the Scripture) to be infallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="816" facs="tcp:40740:366"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This covering is too ſhort, and indeed not ſound; for I am not bound to take notice how they prove it to others, but how they prove it to me. If they prove it thus to me, then, by their owne confeſſion, they are included in a circle. And they prove it thus to me, becauſe I hold the Scripture to be God's word indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the Church; and ſo he ſaith of me, <hi>[as you do.]</hi> Secondly, whereas he ſayes, <hi>If I be a Scholar, I may know</hi> that their <hi>Divines</hi> do not anſwer ſo when they are put upon the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Why do you believe the Church?</hi> I do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that for my part I never pretended to be a Scholar, as they do, <hi>ſignanter.</hi> I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head, nor heart, nor body, nor books for the Controverſies: but yet this I know, that <hi>de officio,</hi> this is the way of conſtituting, and ſo of diſtinguiſhing the Church: and <hi>de facto,</hi> this is the way that S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and alſo ſome of their owne Divines do prove the Church by: yea, this is the way which my Adverſaries muſt take and do. And thirdly, neither do we ſay, that we believe the Scripture to be the word of God by the teſtimony of the Spirit, but to thoſe who do profeſſe the beliefe of the Scripture to be the word of God. And therefore are we even with them in this kinde: for as they deale with Heathens as to the proofe of Scripture by the Church: ſo do we alſo, as the Fathers were wont by the Church univerſal. And I can uſe the authority of the Church as an inducement unto the Heathen, although the Pontificians cannot uſe the authority of the Chnrch to me as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminative of faith. So then if they can prove the authority of the Church infallibly to be
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:40740:366"/> infallible without dependence upon the Scripture, they ſhall indeed ſpeak to <hi>the purpoſe:</hi> Otherwiſe they are ſhut up <hi>in a circle,</hi> out of which they can never move their foot.</p>
            <p>The thirty ſecond number hath in it much and little—<hi>longae,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The intendment of it is to fix the wheel, by aſſuring the Church to be infallible without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Scripture.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of it it would prove their faith good, becauſe they believed thoſe, who delivered it, had <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from God. But this ſatisfieth not, becauſe the queſtion rebounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, why they believed that thoſe, who delivered it had Commiſſion from God. If they ſay they had aſſurance thereof by the Spirit, then they come to our kind of aſſurance.</p>
            <p>Therefore they determine this belief upon two motives; one comming from the Doctrine in order to God, change of life; the other from God in order to the Doctrine, in miracles, and there he amplifies in two leaves, which might have been diſpatched in three words. Indeed the firſt he ſays not much of; for it is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding argument. For firſt, it doth not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Doctrines: for thus the Jew, the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the Socinian, the Sectary might prove his Doctrine infallible. Secondly, the good life, if it were a reſult of Doctrine, yet not from the points of difference, but the generall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls of Chriſtian faith, wherein the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies lie not. Yea, thirdly, if this new life did proceed by way of emanation or abſolute connexion from the points of difference, we might join iſſue with them and have the better. Yea,
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:40740:367"/> fourthly, <hi>Judas</hi> had a right Commiſſion and yet no good life. Yea, fifthly, the manners are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be proved good by the practicall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than ſpeculative Doctrine (if any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ultimately be ſuch) proved good by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Therefore good life is no <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrine; nor yet of a Divine Commiſſion. Yea, ſixthly, <hi>Dato non conceſſo,</hi> that we mighr know the Church, and Doctrine of it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible by good life; yet this is not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to their poſtulate, that God ſhould teach us all verity by the mouth of the Church, as <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>Then as to the other motive of faith in the true Church, namely, miracles, we can ſay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall things; firſt <hi>in theſi,</hi> miracles are no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtinctive of a Divine Commiſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the man of ſin may deceive by lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. And alſo <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2. Then this is no infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motive for the believing of a <hi>Commiſſion from God,</hi> becauſe we may be deceived in it. And although upon ſuppoſition of a true miracle we might conclude a Commiſſion from God, yet this is not the way infallible becauſe we may be deceived in the truth of the miracle, whether it be ſuch or not: ſince the miracle cannot <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem facere de ſe,</hi> as the teſtimony of the Spirit can. Secondly, the gift of miracles was a gift common to thoſe who were not all Prophets as to penning of the Scripture; and alſo not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, for ought we know, to ſome who did, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> therefore this is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to reſolve our faith in their Commiſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not given <hi>Omni</hi> nor <hi>ſoli:</hi> for whatſoever doth diſtinguiſh muſt have it ſelf <hi>per modum dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentiae.</hi>
               <pb n="819" facs="tcp:40740:367"/> Thirdly, therefore ſince we muſt have faith to believe the miracles to be true, we aſk how we come to this faith: if by the operation of the Spirit; then faith ultimately is fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our foundation, namely, the teſtimony of the Spirit, by which we may as well be aſſured that the Scripture is the true word of God, as that miracles are true. Fourthly, the gift of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was temporary and accomodated for that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Church. And therefore cannot we prove by miracles new Doctrines, as Invocation of Saints, worſhipping of Images, Communion in one kinde, Tranſubſtantiation, Supremacy of the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: therefore if miracles did infallibly aſcertain the divine Commiſſion of the <hi>Prophets and Apoſtles</hi> to ſpeak and write: yet are not we ſatisfied by them in the queſtion of new Doctrines, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives us no account of; but therefore he comes to <hi>Oral tradition.</hi> For, as for his reaſoning in form thus, <hi>in hypotheſi, The Preachers preached the Doctrine of our Church; God confirmed their Doctrine by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: therefore the Doctrine of our Church was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by miracles,</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For firſt (not to carp at the form of his ſyllogiſm) we ſay to the propoſition, that if they preached the Doctrine of the Roman Church as differently from the whole Church, they preached what they ought not to preach; and ſo the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition is falſe. If they did preach the ſame doctrine which the whole Church received in Scripture from the Apoſtles, then we grant the <hi>minor</hi> and the concluſion too, as much as doctrine can be confirmed by miracles; but we diſtinguiſh of the time when the miracles were wrought; namely in the time of the Apoſtles, and by them. For, as for miracles done by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to confirm <hi>the ſame faith</hi> which we <hi>aboliſhed in</hi> our
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:40740:368"/> 
               <hi>reformation;</hi> we ſay that <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Brierly,</hi> whom he quotes for teſtimony hereof, are not to us ſurely of ſufficient authority in their own cauſe. Nay ſecondly, they had beſt not add the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the learned <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> leſt they be aſhamed to ſlight them in other matters; but alſo chiefly upon this conſideration; becauſe, if the points of difference were confirmed by <hi>many miracles,</hi> (which he refers us to <hi>Brierly</hi> in his Index for) then by the Argument before, thoſe points of difference were new: for as miracles have themſelves to faith; ſo new miracles to new faith. And if it was a new faith, then it was not received by <hi>oral tradition</hi> from the Apoſtles ſucceſſively: and then they are undone. Therefore let them ſpeak no more to us of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, who ſhewed nothing ſo much wonderful as his pride in obtruding upon old Chriſtians, ancienter than <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; therefore it is too much curteſie to take any notice of what he ſaies about the faith brought into <hi>England</hi> by S. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and yet we can make uſe of it too: for if it be ſo as he ſaies, that the <hi>faith brought into England by St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>was the ſame faith which</hi> was <hi>aboliſhed by</hi> our <hi>reformation</hi> then we have aboliſhed none but the Roman faith: and the Chriſtian faith in the general principles of it we had before. And this might be enough for the virtue of miracles: but that he ſaies miracles are called <hi>a teſtimony greater than John the Baptiſt.</hi> Are they ſo? then we take leave to ſhew what his words in two places will come to, even in the ſame page 72. before in the ſame p. he had ſaid that a miracle doth not make a thing ſo <hi>prudently credible as univerſal tradition;</hi> here he ſaies that a miracle is a greater teſtimony than <hi>John the Baptist:</hi> whence we argue thus; That which is greater than that which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:40740:368"/> is greater than that which is leſs: miracles are here ſaid to be <hi>greater teſtimony than John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;</hi> and <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s teſtimony was greater than of Univerſal Tradition; then miracles are a greater teſtimony than of univerſal Tradition. But let this paſs.</p>
            <p>And now we ſhall touch upon what he ſaies about Tradition: ſaving that we muſt ſmile at what he ſaies about the truth of their miracles, that there is as little to be ſaid againſt them, as againſt the miracles of the <hi>Prophets and Apostles.</hi> This is not to be anſwered until the miracles of the Maid of <hi>Kent</hi> may be compared with thoſe of <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and until their Doctrine, which they would have confirmed by their miracles, be found as good and authentick as that of the Apoſtles, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by their miracles. But to Tradition we come. <hi>Thus was the first age aſſured of God's word by the oral tradition of the firſt Paſtors of the Church, who had received it in the name of God from the Apoſtles, who gave their Writings to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is not much to their purpoſe. For firſt, unleſs oral tradition did exclude the divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Gods Spirit, they cannot ſay that the <hi>firſt Age</hi> was aſſured by this and not by that. And this teſtimony is not excluded neither by oral tradition nor by miracles ſimply: for Gods Spirit might aſſure them of the truth of each: and then the laſt ground of faith is the teſtimony of the Spirit. Secondly, let orall tradition be reſtrained as to object of thing: or let it equally be proved of the new points fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, otherwiſe they have not by orall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient benefit. Thirdly, notwithſtanding the Apoſtles own preachings, which were more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tradition, and notwithſtanding all miracles done by the Apoſtles, which both equally had themſelves
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:40740:369"/> to al then hearers of the one or ſpectators of the other yet as many as were ordained to eternal life believed <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. So that the belief did effectually follow upon the efficacy of the Spirit of God applying the means of faith home to their Conſciences. It is not ſaid as many as did believe were ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, as if the belief foreſeen had it ſelf <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter</hi> to the ordination; but as many as were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eternall life believed. Fourthly, as for the <hi>Jews and Proſelytes</hi> they had alſo, who lived in the time of Chriſt, for the means of their aſſurance, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets; who had propheſied of Chriſt and Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And as for that which follows, that <hi>the firſt Paſtors (beſides their oral tradition) did aſſure them that the Spirit of God would abide with the Church, teaching her all truth, &amp;c.</hi> We anſwer, firſt, if the firſt Paſtors did teach any thing, they could teach nothing but what they received <hi>from the Apoſtles who gave their writings to them,</hi> as before: and why then may not we take it better from the writings of the Apoſtles than from their teaching? for <hi>primum in ſuo genere eſt menſura reliquorum.</hi> But ſecondly, where have they ſufficient inducement of belief either by orall tradition, or miracles, or whatſoever prudential mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that this reſpects the Church under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of a Repreſentative? Yea, thirdly therefore, if ſo, how was it made true to the Church in thoſe Centuries wherein there was no formall Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; namely, for 200 <hi>years and more</hi> wherein <hi>they had nothing but tradition to make them give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſent to their Church,</hi> as himſelf ſays in this Paragraph? Fourthly, if this promiſe attended the Church under the account of a Repreſentative, yet of the whole Church: and what is this to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church which is but a part even in St. <hi>Jeroms</hi>
               <pb n="823" facs="tcp:40740:369"/> judgement in his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius?</hi> Yea, alſo fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that promiſe was not ſpoken by the Apoſtles to the Church, but by Chriſt to the Apoſtles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can it not be drawn down in a parallel line to all the ages of the Church: and therefore that which follows in the 71 p. is without any foundation. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile fundamentum fallit opus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he reinforceth the power of univerſal tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Now there is nothing which can make any thing more prudently credible than univerſall tradition,</hi> and ſo he prefers it to a <hi>miracle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And have they vouched univerſal tradition? by univerſall tradition they may be caſt: for they cannot find univerſall tradition for their ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary points: and there was univerſal tradition for ſome points which they have caſt off, as before; namely, the millenary point, and infant baptiſm. So then, by their own argument, they are unprovided of ſuch a proof <hi>than which nothing can make a thing more prudently credible.</hi> Secondly, if he means by the terms <hi>[prudently credible]</hi> preciſely ſuch, then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from infallibility: and ſo all this diſcourſe comes ſhort of the ſtate of the queſtion, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects infallible aſſurance. If he means it ſubordinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that which makes infallible aſſurance, then why doth he inſiſt upon this as the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of all faith? and then let them tell us what that is which doth abſolutely fix belief, and determines doubting. And ſurely the terms he uſeth <hi>per ſe</hi> do ſeem to be <hi>termini diminuentes,</hi> that which is urg'd as <hi>prudently</hi> credible abſtracts neceſſarily from that which is infallibly credible: for they are <hi>ſub diverſo genere.</hi> And ſo when all comes to all, upon the whole matter, and at the foot of the account, all faith goes no higher than a prudentiall aſſent. Then thirdly, therefore as
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:40740:370"/> to the force of the Argument, he hath no Adverſary; for we can ſay ſo to, <hi>Nothing can make any thing more prudently credible than univerſall tradition:</hi> and we can make uſe of this motive as well as the Roman, yea, ſomewhat better, becauſe he will ſhrink the whole Church into one City of <hi>Rome.</hi> But fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuppoſe nothing in the kind of that which is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible, as ſuch, were above univerſall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: yet this concludes not rightly that abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in an higher kind nothing is more credible: for this teſtimony of the Spirit, which is not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, makes a thing not only prudently credible, but neceſſarily and in the way of Divine faith. And that which is prudently credible doth not include this: but this eminently includes that which is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall credibility.</p>
            <p>Yet he goes on. <hi>Yet here I intreat you to mark how they reſolv'd</hi> their <hi>faith then,</hi> &amp;c. namely, in the ſpace of <hi>the</hi> 200 <hi>years and more</hi> wherein <hi>they had nothing but tradition to make them give an infallible aſſent to their Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This I have marked and not precariouſly. But what ſhall I ſee in it that will give a ſober man any ſatisfaction? For firſt, what if they did <hi>believe the ſoul to be immortall, becauſe God ſaid it by the Church;</hi> and the Church, becauſe <hi>it ſaid that it had Commiſſion from God, is authorized with infallibility;</hi> and did alſo believe this becauſe the Church ſaid ſo; and why ſo, <hi>becauſe they would do ſo?</hi> what of all this? therefore we are not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly aſſured that the Scripture is the word of God by the teſtimony of the Spirit? If they did believe indeed in way of a Divine faith, then the Spirit of God did aſſure them by tradition. For otherwiſe
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:40740:370"/> they forſake the antient Theological account of faith; and they muſt either ſay, that faith is not an habit infuſed; or that it may be an habit infuſed without the Spirit of God, but if they believed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, or in the way of humane faith, (as we doe believe there are ſeven hills at <hi>Rome,</hi> without uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall tradition or a miracle) then this is not to the purpoſe; for the diſcourſe is peccant in the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Elench:</hi> we can ſay as much without contradiction to our cauſe. Secondly, they cannot ſurely expect that we ſhould gratifie them ſo much as to ſay there is as much reaſon to believe tradition now as then, becauſe now they themſelves will ſay, that we have the benefit of what aſſurance the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils can make. And alſo 3. we muſt here note out of their own words, for the uſe of our cauſe, that for the ſpace of 200 <hi>years and more they had nothing but tradition to make them give an infallible aſſent to their Church:</hi> So then for the ſame ſpace they had not the coroboration of general Councils: and therefore theſe do not make the reaſon of belief ſimply as they would have it, becauſe the Church was ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. 4. Though the univerſal comprehends par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, yet a particular doth not comprehend an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal: therefore whatſoever aſſent is due to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition univerſal is not due to tradition particular of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is their trick to build all upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ground of the whole Church: and then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the univerſal Church within the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> This we muſt enter our plea againſt upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. 5. We ſee they are come off unto ſome latitude in their conception of faith, becauſe the laſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this queſt of faith they make to be thus, and <hi>they would do ſo becauſe they would do ſo,</hi> and again, <hi>becauſe it had been more folly not to accept of this
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:40740:371"/> Church's Commiſſion to teach them infallibly all truths:</hi> So that now the acquiſcence of the ſoul in the deep miſtery of faith muſt be terminated and determined upon rhe variable point and principle of prudence; and that which muſt eternaly ſetle our mind in the firſt and laſt ground of infallibility, muſt be this; <hi>we do ſo becauſe</hi> we will <hi>do ſo, or becauſe it were folly not to believe.</hi> So then, ſince, <hi>currente rota,</hi> the diſcourſe is come to this; let us have our liberty to believe as we do believe, becauſe we ſee it to be <hi>folly</hi> (for ought can be ſeen by them) to accept the <hi>Church's Commiſſion to teach infallibly all truths.</hi> Sixthly, if they ſay <hi>all truths,</hi> then they ſeem to be fallen from their former Conceſſion, and alſo <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton's,</hi> that ſome truths may be believed without neceſſity of the Church. Seventhly, as for the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul,</hi> which they inſiſt in to have been believed, <hi>becauſe God ſaid it by the Church,</hi> we ſay eaſily, that this might with leſſe difficulty be received from the Church, becauſe it is ſurely probable, and ſome will ſay demonſtrable, by reaſon: and therefore is not only aſſerted by <hi>Plato,</hi> who might have it from the Jewes by redundance in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (whither he and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and ſome others travelled for wiſdom, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> witneſſeth) but alſo in effect, as I think, by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi> And alſo here certainly they muſt be put to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the whole Church; or elſe his words are not true; or elſe Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. did not belong to the Church; for he did not commend to others the Faith of the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
            <p>And yet he goes on. <hi>Which Commiſſion, to teach them infallibly all truth they knew by tradition to
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:40740:371"/> have been ever accepted as Divine by all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> This reaſon, if I may ſay ſo, is ſurely full of it ſelf, but not ſolid, for it doth in effect run round again; and the Faith of the Church is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Church: for they make <hi>all good people</hi> to be convertible with the Church: and therefore they make the holy Catholick Church to be the viſible. But how then is the Church <hi>Regula regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi> the Rule ruled, as hath been confeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Secondly, muſt we content our ſelves with this in the grand concernment of faith, becauſe the Church did accept this Commiſſion as Divine, which we know by Tradition? but how ſhall we know this Tradition to be of the Church, before we know the Church? Are they adviſed of this? then muſt we come to be aſſured of the Doctrine before we be aſſured of the Church. And this Doctrine we muſt be aſſured of independently of the Church, becauſe we cannot know the Church but by the Doctrine; and by the Doctrine of the Scripture too, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſcourſeth againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> Thirdly, if all good people know by tradition this Commiſſion to be divine, then my Adverſary needed not to have pinched the laſt reſolution of faith ſo as to have ſaid, they believed, <hi>becauſe they would do ſo,</hi> or <hi>becauſe it had been meer folly not to accept this commiſſion:</hi> for though univerſal Tradition cannot tranſcend its ſphere unto a cauſality of proper faith divine; yet hath it more reaſon in it than to make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall beliefe arbitrary, or to preſerve the act of it from folly in the negative. A Divine aſſurance will not be compared with a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive prudence: but univerſal tradition doth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it. We had beſt then compound the difference
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:40740:372"/> betwixt himſelf by a kind of diviſion thus, negative prudence was ſuitable to his former proof <hi>(Aqua aſcendit quantum deſcendit)</hi> but Divine aſſurance (which I ſuppoſe he urgeth by tradition) is neceſſary for the queſtion. For the certainty of faith is ſuch as <hi>cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum,</hi> in which there can be no falſity: and therefore probability cannot make faith; and negative prudence can amount no higher than probability. Fourthly, if we muſt now ſet the <hi>baſis</hi> and the foundation of all Divine faith in univerſal tradition, then Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> carries the victory clearly from the Romaniſt: for this he diſputed for in oppoſition to the Roman. Fifthly, <hi>All good people</hi> cannot make a demonſtration or faith of a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And we have cauſe to note this as invalid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if goodneſs of manners were ſimply probative of true faith, then we ſhould be all nought in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man opinion, becauſe we differ with them in faith: for if we had been all <hi>good people,</hi> we ſhould have accepted their grounds; and hence we ſee their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reaſon of uncharitableneſs to us; wherein they communicate with Sects or Sects with them. But if goodneſs of life be ſo profitable for proof of truth, then my Adverſary with the reſt of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians do not ſo wiſely diſtinguiſh betwixt mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and infallibility in their Popes: For ſurely then <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh had been no good head of the Church; nor <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, who ſurely laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his ſleeve when he ſaid to an Ambaſſadour, <hi>Quantum lucri nobis peperitilla fabula de Chriſto,</hi> I had thought goodneſſe had not belonged to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Divinity, as ſuch. Indeed it becoms all Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to be very good: but this is one of the firſt times that I heard of this argument. Let them therefore put in ſome formall principle of diſcerning truth,
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:40740:372"/> as goodneſs is not; unleſs the will can preſcribe to the judgement, as the judgement to the will, and if it can, they have the worſe cauſe. Therefore may we conclude this long Paragraph with a ſober denial of what he concludes it with: the <hi>ground upon which you believe Scripture</hi> to be the word of God, <hi>is thought to be Chimaerical by ſome of your beſt Writers.</hi> It is proved otherwiſe, and that it is not accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fooliſh or Chimerical by ſome of the beſt of our Writers, we have ſeen before; neither Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Chillingworth:</hi> nay, nor by ſome of their beſt Writers neither, as <hi>Stapleton;</hi> beſides ſome others quoted by Dr. <hi>White,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But if he would ſtand to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he might have ſpared this diſpute about Scripture; for we are not to diſpute the truth of Scripture, he ſays, as of other writings. To conclude then this number in kind, we might as well take the boldneſſe to ſay, that their ground upon which they ſtand in the maintenance of their faith as different from us, is, <q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p>A Lion before, a Dragon behind, and a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera in the middle.</p>
            <p>In this number he urgeth unſecurity of our grounding faith, as to the ignorant, in tranſlations:<note place="margin">Num. 34.</note> but this hath been by him preſſed before, and by me anſwered: and nothing is here replied by him: but ſomewhat more is promiſed, ch. 4. n. 9. And therefore might we ſkip it, but it may be he would interpret our omiſſion to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. He ſays then. <hi>How unſecurely the greater part of your Religion did ground their faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt truſt the tranſlations of private men, and believe them rather and uſe them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:40740:373"/> than the tranſlations uſed by the Church in Generall Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ecce iterum Criſpinus</hi> — but we anſwer, in this he would have three propoſitions granted him; one, that Generall Councils did uſe their Latine tranſlation. Secondly, that our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the off-ſpring of private men. Thirdly, that moſt of us muſt ground their faith in the truſt of private mens tranſlations. To theſe we anſwer in three words, and in generall, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of them. As to the firſt, we ſay that the General Councils which were celebrated in <hi>Greece</hi> did not ſurely make uſe of the Latine tranſlation. Nay, ſecondly, their Latine tranſlation, which they would have to be <hi>Jerom's</hi> for antiquity, was not at firſt received in the Church, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Yea, thirdly, their Latine tranſlation, which now they uſe cannot be St. <hi>Jerom's:</hi> for I hope it was mended by <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and again refined by <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth and ſurely though it was Canonized by the Trent Council before it was made; yet ſurely it was not made currant in the Church for uſe before it was born. And if they ſay, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and materiall difference betwixt their Latine as now and in antient times, we ſay firſt, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that <hi>Iſider Clarius,</hi> who came after <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> will then find fault with both in ſeverall thouſand places: But then alſo we ſay in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, neither are there any reall and materiall differences in our Engliſh from the original. But fourthly, did the Generall Councils uſe the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tranſlation for their Judge in Scripture, then are not the Generall Councils infallible, becauſe that tranſlation was not infallibly made; nor made infallible by the Church even in the Trent
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:40740:373"/> Council, as ſome of their own have intimated, as before.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond propoſition, we give alſo a denial. Our Engliſh tranſlation is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the tranſlation of private men; becauſe it is authorized by our Church, although at firſt made by private men: And what if they yet made good to hinder as great an aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God to the eſtabliſhment of this Tranſlation, as they finde for their Remiſh Teſtament. That which is made by private men is made more than private by authority of the Church. And if they deny this diſtinction, they undo all their Councils. And if they ſay our Church hath it ſelf, as a private part, to the whole: ſo we ſay doth the Roman, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to the third propoſition, we deny it alſo: the moſt do not truſt in the Tranſlations: nay, none do truſt in Tranſlations, ſimply; becauſe they are not Scripture, as <hi>per ſe;</hi> but analogically to the Scripture in the originall. So that ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately they are aſſured, that the tranſlation is in the matter agreeable to Scripture, as they are aſſured that the Scripture is the word of God, namely, through faith infuſed by the Spirit of God. So they do not believe the Tranſlation, but that which is tranſlated. The Tranſlation formally is no mean to aſſure their Faith; but is a mean of conveyance of it to their knowledge. And ſurely our people may as well believe that the Tranſlation is as free from all damnative er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; as their people may believe what their Church propoſeth to be free from damnative error: firſt, becauſe they rely upon a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation that teach, and a Tranſlation not ſo good, Secondly, becauſe our people can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:40740:374"/> the Tranſlation: ſo cannot their people underſtand the Vulgar Latine: and therefore if thoſe who tranſlated it were not deceived, yet thoſe who propoſe it may deceive the people: and thirdly, becauſe the authority of their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation were <hi>far greater,</hi> yet was it made by thoſe Prieſts of theirs <hi>deeply intereſſed in this cauſe;</hi> as well as he ſaies our might be by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Miniſters deeply intereſſed in this cauſe: and alſo becauſe yet is not their Tranſlation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as hath been proved: and therefore cannot the people believe the Church. And the Argument is thus: If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were infallible then in the Tranſlation of the Bible; and the reaſon of the conſequence is demonſtrated from the end of it appointed in the fourth ſeſſion of the Trent Council, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis lectionibus, diſputationibus, praedicationibus et expoſitionibus pro authentica habeatur:</hi> this the end of the inſtitution of it, that in all readings, diſputations, preachings and expoſitions, it ſhould be held for authentick; and therefore if ever they would put out all their power of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, then ſurely in this tranſlation; but now <hi>falſum poſterius;</hi> this tranſlation is not infallible, as hath been proved and confeſſed by ſome of their learnedſt men; as alſo might be inſtanced in the reading of <hi>ipſa</hi> for <hi>ipſum,</hi> attributing that to the Virgin which all the tranſlation, (with the Hebrew) in our great Bible attribute to the Seed, namely, to Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may we ſurely as well believe our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as they their Church. Therefore let them hereafter not ſend us ſuch arguments as will be returnable with uſe.</p>
            <pb n="841" facs="tcp:40740:374"/>
            <p>This thirty fifth Paragraph he might alſo have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, wherein he thought to pinch me with uncertainty of true copies of the original. For this will fall upon them in the full weight, for we have as good Copies of the Originals as the Romans; If we had ours from them, then I hope we have as good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not, then we depended not, at firſt, of them. Whether we believe the Copies we have to be true by the Church, this queſtion hath it ſelf accidentally to the truth of the Copies, becauſe if we have not the true Copies, the Church cannot make that which is not true to be true, as the Papiſts themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and if we be led by that faith which is certain, though we are not ſo aſſured of it to be ſo, we may attain Salvation, may we not? If not, then have the Papiſts no ſuch reaſon to pick a quarrel with us about certainty of Salvation in the Subject.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak then more punctually, we can uſe the Roman Copies if we had none other, without their infalibility: <hi>Utile per inutile non vitiatur,</hi> and if we have any others, as it ſhould ſeem we have upon the true account of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the Britiſh Churches, then we comparing them with theirs, can find that ours <hi>are true Originals;</hi> if theirs be. For as for the knowledge of them to be <hi>undoubtedly true Originals</hi> by the credit of the beſt Churches, this cannot rationally do it, becauſe (if there be a doubt of the true Originals) we muſt firſt know which is the beſt Church by the true Original. Therefore let them tell us which Church is beſt to be truſted in this caſe, they will ſay, <hi>the beſt;</hi> but the queſtion returns, which is the beſt? This we muſt know by the <hi>true Original,</hi> and this is it which is in queſtion, ſo that we muſt be primarily aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome other way either of the Church or of the true Original: and what way can that be but by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Spirit, by whom all Faith is ingenerated? and then they come about again to us <hi>in genere:</hi> either to be aſſured by the Holy Ghoſt that this is the beſt Church,
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:40740:375"/> or that this is the true Original. If the latter, then by this we are aſſured of Scripture, if the former, then how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the laſt reſolution is by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>This in general concerning the true Originals, He deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to the original of the Old Teſtament, <hi>as for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew all muſt know that the antient Hebrew Copies were all written without points that is in ſubſtance, without vowels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Romans could determine all controverſies by ſuppoſition as they do this, they then indeed might pretend to be Judges of all controverſies: he might have conſidered that this hath been a mighty queſtion as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the diſcourſe about it on each part of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>And as to this, they are wrapped into as great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as we, untill they can prove two points, Firſt that their Church put the Points or Vowells, <hi>Puncta vocalia,</hi> to the words. Secondly, that their Church did it infallibly, for though the Church did it, yet if theirs be not the Church, they are never the whit the nearer; and if theirs be the Church, and they did it not infallibly, they are not yet Maſters of their end. Secondly, we except againſt his preſumption <hi>of all Copies</hi> to be written without points; there is not the ſame probability as ſome learned men will think: becauſe though ordinarily the words were not pointed with Vowels in every Copy, yet the Kings Copy had Points to it. And thirdly, Do they think that the Moral Law was written by the Finger of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Points? If not, then they knew commonly what Vowels ſhould be put without the Church: for the Church did not put the points thereunto as the Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans think, and if the Decalogue had Points put to it by the Finger of God, then All not without Points, and why not the reſt of the old Teſtament with points? Fourthly, Let any of my Adverſaries ſay <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> and if he doth pronounce it right, let him tell me how he knows he doth pronounce right, he will ſay by tradition; well then yet
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:40740:375"/> he doth not know it by the credit of a particular Church: but let him tell me how, at firſt, this came to be pronounced by the <hi>Gileadite,</hi> and not <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> as by the <hi>Ephramite,</hi> Judges the 12? If then they knew that the <hi>Punctum ſamin</hi> was right, why did not the Jews know a <hi>pari</hi> the other points? Fiftly, Though the points were put to the Conſonants afterwards, yet is it not neceſſary that the Epach hereof ſhould be 476 years after Chriſt at the well of <hi>Tilerias,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin would have it:</hi> For he himſelf ſaies, <hi>That ſome thinks the Points were put to</hi> (the Pentateuch) <hi>by</hi> Moſes <hi>or by ſome excellent Doctor of the Law before the time of Chriſt, it may be</hi> Ezra, as ſome may think. Sixtly, If the Jewiſh Rabbies did fit vowels to the Hebrew Letters, yet ſurely did they not put falſe Points to corrupt the Text, becauſe then ſurely they would have corrupted the Text in thoſe places which ſpeak of the Meſſiah to be ſuch as Jeſus was: which being not done, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> takes it to be an Argument that they did not corrupt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his 2. b. <hi>de verbo dei</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> And therefore, as for that famous Text in this kind <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it is evidently inferred that it was an error of the Scribe in the ſame Chapter, becauſe St.</hi> Jerom, <hi>who did profeſs that he did render the Hebrew ſtrictly, renders it</hi> foderunt. Therefore however the controverſie goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Buxtorfiui</hi> and <hi>Capellus,</hi> what can from hence be concluded which concerns us in <hi>ſpecie?</hi> Let <hi>Bll</hi> be Bill, or Bell, or Ball, or Bull, yet is there nothing in Hebrew for the Pope or his Bull, whether then <hi>the perfidious Iews had honeſty enough to deliver to us true Copies, with true Points, and Vowels,</hi> Let their <hi>Bellarmin</hi> be judge in the former Chap. And yet moreover, ſurely it is more probable, that if the Points were firſt put by the Jews, to the Conſonants, at the well of <hi>Tilerias,</hi> yet they were not put by the <hi>perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Iews,</hi> if he took it for the unbelieving Jews, but by the believing Jews.</p>
            <p>But yet my Adverſary muſt needs object an expreſſion
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:40740:376"/> of the moſt Reverend, and Learned Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, concerning the variety of Sections in the New Teſtament, which <hi>Creſſy</hi> alſo takes notice of. But as to this, upon ſuppoſition, this concerns Chriſtians, <hi>Secundum rationem generalem,</hi> and therefore one would think that we ſhould not be bound to give an account of it as to an Heathen. But ſo the Roman adverſaries muſt order their attains, that either there muſt be no Chriſtian Faith but theirs onely. Secondly, thoſe various Sections, do they make any ſubſtantial change in the matter of ſence, or any contrariety to the Analogie of other Texts, or not? If not, what can be the conſequence from hence to the Church? If ſo, then how can the right reading be reſtored by the Church but through the Holy Ghoſt? Well then, in a Councel alſo or not, if in a Councel, how was the Church herein aſſured for the firſt three hundred years? if without a Councel, then why is infallibility tied to a Councel confirmed by a Pope, as my Adverſary ſayes? Thirdly, we have no reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Roman Church for our ſecurity, in ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of readings, ſince we have the more variety for them; and in <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> too, as Dr. <hi>Iames</hi> aſſerts in his <hi>corruption of Fathers, Councils and Scriptures,</hi> ſo this comes to the Proverb, <hi>Ovem lupo commiſiſti.</hi> But fourthly, they make a very ill Argument for themſelves, for if it be ſo uncertain, which is, not onely a true <hi>Tranſla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion,</hi> but alſo which is the true Original, then how ſhall we be certain whether the Church be infallible ſince the An ſit of this point muſt finally be determined by Scripture? Fiftly, we may be certainly as certain as they; for we have the true Original from them, or not; if we have, then we are as well as they: if not any Original from them, then how do we depend upon them for the Chriſtian Faith as they? If we had the Original Language from them and not the true, then they deceived us by ignorance or worſe. And how ſhould we be bound to believe in them then, as our infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:40740:376"/> Guides? Sixtly, That admirable Prelate did me the Honour himſelf to tell me upon an application to him, that as for the variety of Sections, they were obſerved by him to be of divers ſorts, and ſome inconſiderable: and thoſe of any moment not ſo many as there will be ſuch danger to have them appear, for they are intended to be Printed with the great Bible.</p>
            <p>A touch we have alſo in this number of St. <hi>Matthews Goſpel,</hi> but this hath been agitated before. But yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve how confidently theſe Romaniſts ſpeak, <hi>As for the new Teſtament, St.</hi> Matthews <hi>Goſpel was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written in Hebrew, &amp; that original is quite loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as if it were as ſure as Goſpel that it was written originally in Hebrew not preached onely, but written in Hebrew, and alſo that it was <hi>quite loſt,</hi> if loſt, we may, or may we not think upon the rule in the Trent Hiſtory, he is to be ſuſpected to be Author of a miſchief who hath the intereſt in it?</p>
            <p>So then, we ſee nothing to the contrary, but that yet the term infallibility is an <hi>unfortunate</hi> term, for it loſeth at all turnes.</p>
            <p>Neither will they be able to get off clearely from all <hi>inextricable difficulties,</hi> whatſoever they ſay of us.<note place="margin">N. 36.</note> For firſt, they ſuppoſe that they receive the vulgar tranſlation upon as good authority, <hi>as thoſe who received the first Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal copies. And have they no better certainty for the first original copies?</hi> Then they take a courſe to make Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ridiculous, but this they will ſay for the honour of their Church, <hi>Ridente turcâ nec dolente judaeo,</hi> let Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity crack ſo <hi>Rome</hi> ſtands. So then, by this principle of theirs, if the vulgar Latin hath no certain credibility, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the original copies, as if the original copies had came onely from <hi>Rome,</hi> as the vulgar latin, but for this latin Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we are referred to the fourth Chap. Yet here he gives me a perſtriction for objecting to them <hi>Iſidor Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> correcting of it in ſo many places. <hi>If</hi> Iſidor Clarius <hi>in any one title importing Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:40740:377"/> differs from what we receive upon this infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, we have nothing to do with him.</hi> And is this all?</p>
            <p>But firſt, he needs not make an <hi>if</hi> of it, for if he will peruſe but his Preface, he ſhall find him to profeſs that he uſed a great deal of moderation leſt offence ſhould be taken, and that it might not ſeem to be a new Tranſlation; and yet he ſaith, <hi>Loca tamen ad octo millia annotata, atque a nobis emendata ſunt,</hi> eight thouſand places have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and mended by me. And do none of them, think you, reſpect faith and manners?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Me thinks they are warping and coming off again to the former diſtinction, that the Church could not be propoſer of any damnative error, <hi>importing Faith and Manners.</hi> And this in Mr. <hi>Knot</hi>'s opinion, as before, ſpoiles all. So then the Church might erre, in this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, from the Originals, but not in things <hi>importing Faith or Manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do they then think there was any fault at all in the Original Copies which the firſt Church received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If ſo, then there muſt be faults in Original Scripture: If not, now can they receive the vulgar Tranſlation with an equal Faith of infalibility, as they do the Original Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies? Let Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> rebate ſomewhat that high Conceit of the Authentikneſſe of the vulgar Latin (which they know was but a product of a Council) in his 26. <hi>de Author. Concil.</hi> the 12. <hi>ch.</hi> Let them, from thence, conſider whether the Scriptures are not to be preferred before the Decrees of Councels in many regards, where he will tell them, at the latter end of the Chap. that that of <hi>Gregory,</hi> reverencing the four Councils General, as the four Goſpels is to be qualified, <hi>illud [ſicut] ſonare ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem non aequalitatem</hi> that that [As] doth ſignifie ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude not equality, indeed, as <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> ſaies of <hi>Plato, That what he had ſaid well in things Divine, he doth mingle and confound with contrariety, for fear of</hi> Mars-<hi>hill, leſt he ſhould ſuffer for it, as</hi> Socrates; ſo this the Cardinal
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:40740:377"/> doth ſeem to retract in the following words, (for fear of the ſeven hills) <hi>as to equality of infalibility,</hi> but yet in <hi>Iudiciis particularibus, &amp; in judiciis morum, quae non toti Eccleſiae ſell uni tantum aut alteri populo proponuntur,</hi> in particular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in precepts of manners which are not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the whole Church, but to one or another people, he ſaies <hi>they may erre in the ſame Chap.</hi> but ſo may not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore can they not receive the vulgar edition abſolutely, as the firſt Church did receive the Original Copies, ſo that either my Adverſary hath overſhot, or the Cardinal under; and if they will have <hi>nothing to do with him,</hi> that in any <hi>title importing Faith or Manners</hi> differ from them, then they have many to excommunicate on <hi>Munday Thurſday,</hi> though they abſolve them again on <hi>Good Friday,</hi> as they do the King of Spain for detaining part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony.</p>
            <p>And as for the other exception I made againſt the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, by the varieties of the Edition of <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5tus and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the 8th. he refers me to a <hi>Famous Book, called Charity maintained, written againſt Dr.</hi> Potter, <hi>See it Part</hi> 2. <hi>c. b. n.</hi> 3. as I take it in his Copy, but he ſaves me the labour, in telling me the effect of it thus, That, <hi>by Authentical teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of perſons beyond all exception, is ſhewed (there) that the decree of</hi> Sixtus 5tus <hi>about his Edition was never promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and that he had declared divers things to have crept in, which needed a ſecond revew, and that the whole work ſhould be re-examined though he could not do it, being prevented by death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> according to their principles, no <hi>Authentique teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> but of a Council confirm'd by the Pope, let them ſhew ſuch: And then we ſay, Secondly, what if the decree of <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5tus was not promulg'd? was not this <hi>Sixtus 5tus's</hi> Edition? And it ſeems there was a decree for it, but not promulg'd, and the promulgation makes it but legible, the decree, I hope, makes it credible; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation attends the binding of it in, <hi>actu exercito,</hi> but the
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:40740:378"/> decree attends the conſtitution of it, <hi>in actu ſignato.</hi> And was there no error in it becauſe it was not promulgated? Or rather was not it therefore not promulgated becauſe there was error in it?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Authority of the Trent Council was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, rather for this than for that of Clement the 8th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Trent Council, (as they know) ſpeaks of it as <hi>in verbis de preſenti, haec ipſa vetus &amp; vulgata editio, quae longo tot ſaeculorum uſu, in ipſa eccleſiâ probata est,</hi> this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame old and vulgar edition, which by long uſe of ſo many ages is approved in the very Church, as if it had been ſo long before born, and now when it was of age, ſhould be onely Chriſten'd.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How did <hi>divers things creep in which needed a ſecond review?</hi> what, while the Church ſlept? then how can we believe the Church, in tradition and purity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, for ſhe may ſleep while they are ſtolen or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Therefore have they no cauſe to triumph that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath ſaid nothing to this point, in defence of Docter <hi>Potter,</hi> as they ſay, in the following words. For if the Citation be right [Part 2.] Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> did not publiſh, for ought I knew, what he had againſt the ſecond part. And he gives an account thereof, why he did not, in the latter end of his Anſwer to the 1 part p. 390. And therfore they did not ingenuouſly charge him with this omiſſion, ſince it was forborne in the whole, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ingenious reaſons. And if they thinke to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves becauſe <hi>Sixtus</hi> his decree was not publiſhed: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> may be excuſed, becauſe the ſecond Part of his Anſwer was not publiſhed, However he had ſaid enough againſt the perfection of the Vulgar tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his anſwer to the firſt part 77.

Laſtly, will they be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the decree was not publiſhed for the authority of the vulgar edition? why then doth it go under the name of <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5us's Bible? yea alſo Dr. <hi>Iames,</hi> who hath written <hi>Bellum Papale</hi> to ſuch a purpoſe, in his third part, 36. <hi>p.</hi> hath aſſerted that all the ſhifts they have made herein will not ſerve; <hi>For both Bull and Bibles are in many mens hands,</hi> whatſoever <hi>Gretſer</hi> ſaith to the Contrary.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 39.</note>In this he begins to reſume his diſcourſe of ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which are neceſſary to Salvation, and yet not plainly ſet down in Scripture. And the firſt inſtance is about the neceſſity of the not working upon the Sunday without any neceſſity. But to this and to the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind, it would be ſufficient again to ſettle the ſtate of the queſtion; and it is thus, whether any thing neceſſary to ſalvation by neceſſity of mean, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge and belief whereof, in points of Faith, or without the knowledge and practiſe of in things of action we cannot come to ſalvation; is not with ſufficient plainneſs ſet down in Scripture: This is the ſtate of the queſtion which very few if any of his inſtances come near to; there may be as errors, ſo ſinnes, which are not clearly forbidden in Scripture: and therefore the ignorance of them will not damne where there is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral repentance. And to hold and do any of theſe againſt
<pb n="851" facs="tcp:40740:380"/> our belief of the Truth therein, or duty, is acknowledged to be damnative without particular repentance; but this comes not up to the queſtion, whether there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſalvation without the belief of the truths and the practiſe of the duties, for ſo neither of us could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſs there be any of us who knows all truths redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatively, and do all duties alſo.</p>
            <p>And this might have ſatisfied my Adverſaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this and other examples; if it had became men pretending infalibility to receive any ſatisfaction but in victory.</p>
            <p>But in particular, <hi>You dare not ſay that he ſhall be ſaved who doth weekly work, and reſolveth to work upon the Sunday without any neceſſity.</hi> And what then? Firſt let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, they dare not ſay that he ſhall be ſaved who reſolves to be abſent from high Maſs without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The point betwixt us is, whether neceſſarily he muſt be damned who doth work upon the Sunday, not knowing whether it be ſuch a ſin; when they determine this, then we may determine by Scripture which part is to be held, whether it is deſtructive of Salvation or not. But Secondly, as to the neceſſity towards Salvation, the intimations of honour which are put upon the firſt day of the week and the practiſe of the Apoſtles is ſufficient to incline our practiſe on the ſafer hand, to wit, in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; and if in contempt hereunto any ſhould reſolve to work without neceſſity, his caſe would be more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: but the queſtion concerns not ſins in <hi>ſubjecto</hi> with all the circumſtances, but in <hi>ſpecie.</hi> Thirdly, as to the clear Text of the fourth Commandement, the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day to the Jew was poſitive and Ceremonial, and therefore with other Jewiſh Ceremonies never to ceaſe, or if that alſo was morall, why do we not heare of it by their infallibility and practiſe? And if this had been intended for a caſe reſerved to make work for the authority of the Church, why was it not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in ſome general Council? The <hi>Laodicean</hi>

Fourthly, Therefore to conclude this Number, whereas he ſaies I bring my own <hi>Diſcourſes in ſtead of clear Texts,</hi> let him bring either clear Text or clear diſcourſe for theſe two Propoſitions, 1. That this Point is abſolutely neceſſary to be known: And 2. That it is not clearly ſet down in Scripture, then we ſhall leave him in the field for this time: but if he will not anſwer to my Diſcourſes, becauſe they are <hi>fallible,</hi> he gives me leave to think more, and to ſay no more to his Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon the ſame account.</p>

               <note place="margin">N. 40.</note>In this Number he ſeems to be courteous, in receiving ſome ſatisfaction to my Anſwer about <hi>things ſtrangled.</hi> But it may be he thought himſelf bound to it upon the general ſuppoſition of the Romaniſt, that the Scripture was written but for particular occaſions, and to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons: and therefore that Precept of the Apoſtles in the 15 of the <hi>Acts</hi> concerning the caſe, ſhould not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their intention be alwaies binding. And yet I ſhall have nothing from him but I muſt pay for it: for he ſays, <hi>Though we ſeek for Texts and not Reaſons.</hi> But reaſon upon Principles of Scripture binds by vertue of the Principles. If not, how many of their Superſtructions muſt they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But let them give us Texts or Reaſons; and until they do ſo, we may have done with them.</p>

               <note place="margin">N. 41.</note>Shall we have either in the next, Whether the King be Head of the Church: This hath been ſufficiently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to before? what is new I ſhall touch upon. He ſaies, <hi>This controverſie muſt highly import that all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may have an aſsured knowledge of the Head by whom they are to be governed.</hi> To this we anſwer, Whatſoever is neceſſary in our ſenſe, highly imports: but, whatſoever highly imports, is not neceſſary in our ſenſe. Therefore, whereas he ſays afterwards, <hi>Is not this a neceſſary point?</hi> we deny it neceſſary in our ſenſe; for then God ſhould tie ſalvation to accidentals. It could not be neceſſary
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:40740:381"/> when and where there is no King, and this is to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt accidentals: but thoſe things which are abſolutely neceſſary, do not vary their nature upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies.</p>
            <p>But then as to the other Propoſition, which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to prove, namely, that this is not clearly enough delivered in Scripture, he ſays, reflecting upon our difference from our ſelves, as he ſuppoſeth, <hi>this point was before evident Scripture, now it is no longer evident Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> To this he brings in my Anſwer. Your Anſwer is firſt, <hi>What is infallibly decided by Scripture, will ever be ſo, although we do not alwaies finde it.</hi> To this he returns, If you mean what is <hi>infallibly decided by Scripture evident, is not alwaies to be found, it is manifeſtly falſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be decided infallibly by Scripture evident in terms, that which he ſays is true: but who holds this point ſo evidently decided? If he means it infallibly decided by evident Scripture in way of conſequence, that which he ſays is <hi>manifeſtly falſe,</hi> is pertinent, but manifeſtly falſe. For how then could ſome Divines in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council aſſert many things to be decided by Principles of Scripture, which the adverſe party there could not finde? And why do they hold, that the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Councils are Prophetical, that ſo they may be infallible; if what is diſcourſed out of Principles could alwaies appear to all to be infallible? And why doth <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſay in his 1. <hi>b. de Baptiſmo, cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ad lit. B.</hi> that the Baptiſm of Infants, <hi>ſatis apertè colligitur ex Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ut ſupra ostendimus,</hi> the Baptiſm of Infants is clearly enough gathered out of Scriptures, as we have ſhewed before: although if my Adverſaries were upon the Jury for this controverſie they would bring in an <hi>Ignoramus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he comes to my ſecond Anſwer. <hi>You adde ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That you do not ſay every point is infallibly decided by Scripture, becauſe it is not at all decided.</hi> Well, and what to this? <hi>Sir, is not this a neceſſary point? Anſw.</hi>
               <pb n="854" facs="tcp:40740:382"/> And is not this, in another mans expreſſion, to be a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the queſtion? Let them prove it to be neceſſary: but it ſeems rather by them, that it is not neceſſary. For ſince the Scripture doth not clearly decide it, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore the Church ſhould, becauſe otherwiſe it will be wanting in things neceſſary where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not determine. Now if the Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for the laſt three of the firſt ſix hundred years. it hath determined againſt the Pope for Kings (not as we take them to be Heads of the Church, as they take the Pope to be <hi>Head,</hi> but) as Supreme Governours <hi>circa Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra.</hi> And ſo the Church for that ſpace, which is moſt conſiderable in this buſineſs, is againſt the Popes being Head of the Church, and the Scripture doth not declare it for him, as my Adverſaries confeſs; for then it ſhould declare by conſequent negatively againſt Kings (as I have ſaid before) and therefore, upon the whole matter, they have nothing for the Popes being Head. And then again, if the Scripture hath not declared for the Pope, it muſt be declarative ſufficiently for the King; becauſe no other pretends to be competitor; and this is their own argumentation. The Church muſt be infallible, no other Church pretends to infallibility but theirs; therefore ſo Government of the Church muſt be. The Scripture ſpeaks of Government; they dare not ſay that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture declares for the Pope; therefore, it muſt declare for Kings. Or, ſince all agreement is reſolved into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles, let this difference be mediated by theſe four Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Government of the Church is neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Government muſt be in the Pope or the King.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scripture doth not declare for the Pope.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Scripture declares all Points neceſſary; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it declares for the King. The three firſt Propoſitions they conſent to. And the fourth is not yet diſproved; therefore</p>

            <p>This Paragraph is a ſupernumerary.<note place="margin">N. 42.</note> To make ſhort work, we have no need of repetitions. But he will urge again S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, and again tax me for holding it <hi>no point of neceſſity to believe</hi> that it was S. <hi>Matthews.</hi> This, he ſaies my <hi>learned Brethren in Ratisbon</hi> durſt not ſay. <hi>Plato</hi>'s rule is good, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not ſo much who ſpeaks, as what; yet this is neceſſary for us to believe, that it was written by one inſpired, indefinitely. But it is not equally neceſſary for me to believe by whom: for then I cannot believe the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> becauſe I cannot certainly believe it was written by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Again, my learned Brethren dared not deny it to be an Article of Faith. But firſt an Article of Faith may be taken largely for whatſoever is to be believed. Now though all Articles of Faith in a ſpecial ſenſe are to be believed: yet all that is to be believed, is not in the ſenſe of the queſtion, an Article of Faith. But then ſecondly, Not to dare to deny it, is not to affirm it. One is a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act: the other a poſitive. But a <hi>pari,</hi> if I muſt be bound to their opinion, why is not my Adverſary bound to his learned Brethren in <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> who did not ſtate infallibilities as my Adverſaries do, with the neceſſity of a Council? And why do my Adverſaries differ from <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and others of their Brethren, who will be <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized</hi> by them, becauſe they diſpute the Popes being Head of the Church from Scripture? for they would be loth to want the Authority of the Scripture for ſo <hi>capital a point,</hi> which concerns not <hi>many millions</hi> onely (as the other, and therefore it ſeems not abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe then it would concern abſolutely all) but even all: for in <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s opinion, as in his Catechiſm, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is defined by union to the Church under the Pope, as Head thereof.</p>
            <p>As for his provoking me to believe the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> upon account of the Church, in this number alſo, by the Authority of S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> I ſay onely, he might have
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:40740:383"/> been ſo modeſt as to have left this out until he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me in what I have ſaid to that Teſtimony of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> at large before.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 43.</note>Here he runs mightily upon a miſtake, for what I ſpoke by way of ſuppoſition, he conſtrues Categorically. I ſaid, we might ſuppoſe more aſſiſtance (not aſſurance) to the Church in commending Books Canonical, than in other caſes. He takes me to have ſpoken poſitively, as if God had given infallibility to the Church in this matter, though in none other; and therefore we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe the Church in this abſolutely. Whereas what I ſaid comes to no more than what is uſually ſaid upon ſuch caſes, <hi>dato non conceſſo.</hi> And do not the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men diſpute upon hypothetical queſtions? As if I ſhould ſay, If the Pope were infallible in perſon, what need would there be of a Council? Or, if my Adverſaries had a minde to be contented with common Principles of Chriſtianity, we ſhould ſoon have done. Theſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are upon meer ſuppoſitions. So, if we were bound to receive the Canonical Books from the Church, we might ſuppoſe more aſſiſtance as to this than to other Points. Doth this affirm that the Church had infallible Aſſiſtance herein, and that we were to take the Books ultimately upon the Authority of the Church? Again, if we were to take the Books upon the account of the Church, what is this to the Roman Church? Is not the Univerſal Church of all times and places more credible than the Roman? The whole bears them, not they the whole. Nay, when he had abuſed my Suppoſition in <hi>p.</hi> 86. he doth acknowledge that I do not make belief of Scripture to depend upon the Authority of the Church.</p>
            <p>So then my Adverſary needs not to triumph and ſay, <hi>This ſpoils all, your onely ſhift,</hi> &amp;c. He runs away with the line, but he will be hooked as well. My Adverſary hath granted me, that the Scripture may be ſaid to
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:40740:383"/> contain all things neceſſary, becauſe it ſendeth us to the Church, where we may have them. And may not I as well ſay to this, that <hi>this ſpoils all?</hi> may I not return him the fruit of his Diſcourſe, <hi>mutatis mutandis?</hi> Will he grant that we have direction to the Church from Scripture? Then the onely ſhift they have to avoid our Poſition of the Scriptures containing all things neceſſary, is <hi>ſtill to ſay</hi> that the Scripture ſends us to the Church. <hi>And will</hi> they <hi>now ſuppoſe this moſt neceſsary point of all points, which is not clearly ſet down in Scripture to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with infallible aſſent, upon the onely Authority</hi> of the Scripture? <hi>That we are univerſally to hear the Scripture,</hi> in things neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>we have many pregnant places in Scripture,</hi> as hath been ſhewed: <hi>but that we are to learn this one point, and none but this, from the infallible Authority of Scripture, hath no colour or ſhadow of Scripture, or any thing like Scripture. You muſt therefore ground your faith not upon Scripture but upon Reaſon. Now the reaſon upon which you reject</hi> the Scripture, is, becauſe you have a neceſſity of an external infallible Judge ever <hi>ſince the whole Canon was finiſhed. And for this onely reaſon (without any Text,) you put</hi> the Scriptures ſufficiency <hi>to expire and give up the ghoſt</hi> even after the finiſhing <hi>of the Canon. Now if the reaſon for which you diſcard</hi> the Scriptures ſufficiency, <hi>be this, becauſe all points</hi> are not <hi>ſufficiently cleared by Scripture, then there can be no other prudent reaſon for which you in this one point may ſuppoſe the</hi> Scripture to be ſufficient <hi>than this, that that one point</hi> (namely, that we are to repair to the Church for all things neceſſary to ſalvation) cannot be infallibly aſcertain'd by the Church. And <hi>therfore there is a greater neceſſity to have recourſe</hi> to the ſufficiency of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>undoubtedly infallible</hi> in all points, which doth not <hi>cauſally bring forth</hi> their opinion of the Church. Let me put them to it. Doth the Scripture bring forth their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, or doth it not. If it doth not: what hold have they for the Church? And why do they make
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:40740:384"/> uſe of the Scripture to give Letters of Credence to the Church? If it doth, then there is an end of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>two inferences</hi> he would have me mark as clearly deduced <hi>from my principles,</hi> are grounded but upon a ſuppoſition: and therefore not to be marked, but returned upon his conceſſion; Firſt, <hi>That all points neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary are plainly ſet down in Scripture: for no point more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than this, without which there is no coming to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of any thing</hi> in the Church: <hi>and yet this point is not plainly ſet down in Scripture;</hi> nor that the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, <hi>obſcurely.</hi> Yea, whereas he ſaies the Scripture ſends us to the Church: the Univerſal Church doth ſend us to the infallible Scripture for our neceſſary dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And this would give them ſatisfaction, if it could ſerve their turn.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the ſecond thing which he would have me mark, halts upon the ſame unequal ground, of ſuppoſing me to affirm what was but ſuppoſed. Yet alſo we can ſend it home again: and I can ſay that their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſpoken of before, <hi>doth overthrow that principle which is the ground-work of</hi> their <hi>faith. For if there be a greater neceſſity to acknowledge</hi> the direction of Scripture in things neceſſary <hi>for as much as concerns this one point of the Church, becauſe this one point in particular is leſs clear</hi> of it ſelf, <hi>that grand principle</hi> of theirs (which is or muſt be their principle) <hi>evidently appeareth falſe;</hi> namely that the Teſtimony of the Church is evidently ſeen <hi>by its own light;</hi> which muſt be, or elſe they are all undone. And again, <hi>how is it poſſible that there ſhould be a greater neceſſity on the one ſide to have recourſe</hi> to the Scripture for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible direction of the Church, becauſe it cannot be proved infallible by it ſelf; and <hi>yet on the other ſide,</hi> this <hi>point of all other points hath this particular priviledge to be ſo manifeſt, that it beareth witneſs of it ſelf, that it carrieth its own light with it.</hi> So they may ſee what they get by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:40740:384"/> a ſuppoſition for an Affirmation. <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s rule is good; let nothing be thought proſperous which is not ingenuous. Some other lines he hath in this Section, to tell me what he hath done before; and I have undone.</p>
            <p>But as to a paſſage which I uſed out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to confirm a Dilemma (which he tells me here that he hath broken before, leſt the contrary ſhould have been better diſcerned upon the place) he referred me to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. In fine, as much as I can reade the hand, I made uſe of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> againſt new Revelations beſide Scripture: and therefore we cannot believe the Church for it ſelf; becauſe we cannot believe it but by a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and no Revelation beſide Scripture, as he diſputes againſt the Anabaptiſts. For my anſwer he puts me off to the former place, I think, in the end. And there is little to the buſineſs. He ſaies indeed in the end, <q>That we do receive the Prophetical and Apoſtolical Books according to the minde of the Catholick Church, as of old it is laid out in the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> and the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to be the Word of God, <hi>Et certam ac ſtabilem regulam fidei,</hi> and the certain and ſtable rule of faith.</q> Now I hope theſe latter words are for us. For if theſe words be taken in their juſt and full ſenſe, then the cauſe is ours. If the Scripture be the certain and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule of faith, then it muſt be clear, otherwiſe how is it a certain rule? and therefore no need of an infallible Judge. And it muſt be ſufficient alwaies; otherwiſe how is it a ſtable rule? and ſo it excludes Traditions.</p>
            <p>But ſure that is not the Chapter, becauſe my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſaies, <hi>in that place where he ſpeaketh of the Maccabees in particular,</hi> which he doth not ſpeak of in the firſt. That Chapter where he particularly ſpeaks of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi> is the fifteenth: but there is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe neither. Thus he puts me to the hunt leſt he ſhould be at a loſs. Well but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is ſurely in the tenth
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:40740:385"/> Chapter, where at the end, he anſwers, as my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary doth, to S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> Authority againſt the Booke of <hi>Maccabees:</hi> But this is beſides the Butt. For that which I looked for to be anſwered out of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> was the other point of no revelation beſide Scripture. It is true that I did in the ſame place name <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as relating S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> differing from my Adverſarie about the Book of the <hi>Maccabees:</hi> But why ſhould I expect an anſwer to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this teſtimony, when he produceth it onely that he might refute it? that which I ſhould have had ſatisfaction in out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was ſpoken by him out of his own judgement. But again, why did not my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſave me the labour of looking up and down for the paſſage by giving me the entire words of the Cardinal there? I might have thought my Adverſary would have been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and he proves rather <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For he thought it was not requiſite that I ſhould finde the place becauſe there are ſome adjacent words which I can improve: He ſaies <hi>Ierome</hi> was of that opinion, <hi>quia nondum Generale Concilium de his libris aliquid ſtatuerat, excepto Libro</hi> Judith, <hi>quem etiam</hi> Hieronymus <hi>poſtea rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</hi> Mark the words; <q>Becauſe the General Council had not yet determined any thing of thoſe Books, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Book of <hi>Iudith,</hi> which alſo afterwards S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> received.</q> So then it ſeems a General Council had before taken theſe Books into conſideration (namely that of <hi>Toby</hi> and <hi>Iudith,</hi> and of the <hi>Maccabees</hi>) and determined nothing but for <hi>Iudith.</hi> Then one of the Councils muſt erre: either that which eſtabliſhed <hi>Iudith</hi> and not the reſt: or that which eſtabliſhed <hi>Iudith</hi> and the reſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of <hi>Carthage,</hi> wihch my Adverſary ſaies S. <hi>Ierome</hi> had not ſeen. One thought them not fit to be declared Canonical: another thought them to be fit. And is not this a contradiction of Council to Council. Again <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſaies that S. <hi>Ierome</hi> did afterwards receive the Book of <hi>Iudith.</hi> Now I deſire to know how much time
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:40740:385"/> that <hi>[after]</hi> doth ſuppoſe for. If S. <hi>Ierome</hi> had received it preſently, we ſhould have heard of it; if much time after, as it might be by the words, then the Authority of the Church ſeemed not to S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſo intuitively to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, as the Antagoniſts ſuppoſe. Had he thought the Church infallible, would he have ſtuck at it?

            <p>What he would have me note by the way, that the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> did acknowledge the <hi>Maccabees</hi> for true Scripture, it is no difficult matter to give account to. For firſt, he goes upon a falſe Principle, that <hi>if thoſe Fathers were of our Religion, then we muſt make them agree with</hi> us <hi>in this prime Principle upon which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all Scripture as Gods infallible Word.</hi> This is not ſo: for my living Adverſaries may know that one who hath defended our Religion hath been quoted to me as differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from me in this point; and that is Mr. <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> Though all that are of this opinion are like to be of our Religion: yet all of our Religion, it ſeems, are not of this opinion. For indeed the Proteſtant Religion ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Scripture to be the Word of God, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principle: and therefore alſo there ſhould not have been any conteſtation about this point, if our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had not been reſolved to queſtion all Religion which is not properly theirs. Secondly, Therefore they might have received Scripture upon the Authority of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tradition; which alſo abſtracts from the Roman Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation. Thirdly, Since they had not Univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for thoſe Apochryphal Bookes, as it ſeems by S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> we cannot neither upon that account be ingaged to receive them as Canonical. Fourthly, Since they did not receive them by Univerſal Tradition, as appears alſo by <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as before; and ſince they are not to be diſcerned by their own light, as my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:40740:386"/> will confeſs, nor by the conditions of the matter, what reaſon ſhall we have to receive them? For if they ſay, the Council was aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt: we ask, what? was it aſſiſted as a Council, or as ſuch a Council? if as a Council, why had not the other the ſame Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? if as ſuch a Council, how ſhall we diſcern which Council the Holy Ghoſt will aſſiſt unto infallibility?</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 45.</note>In this he is pleaſed to move again the ſame ſtone, which will in the end return upon himſelf again. For how came one Council to acknowledge the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and another not? were not the former Council as well <hi>irradiated</hi> as the latter? Yes, they were more in all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but of my Adverſary, who is not in ſo good a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to grant that the Argument from Authority of the Church graduates its ſtrength by the greater nearneſs to the Primitive. For, he holds an equal aſſiſtance of the Spirit to the Church at all times. But the old ſaying was, <hi>Quò antiquius eò melius.</hi> And the rule is good, <hi>Ut ſe habet ſimpliciter ad ſimpliciter, ita magis ad magis &amp; maximè ad maximè,</hi> if it be good as ancient, then the more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent the more good. And this at other times is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which the Romaniſts would take, in claiming the credit of the Original Church to them. And beſides, he might have conſidered that he had no reaſon to bring this about again, becauſe the reaſon of their reception, as was ſaid before, is expreſſed to depend upon the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of their being read in the Church: which doth not make them or declare them to be Canonical unles in S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> diſtinction, for the edifying of the people in manners, not for confirmation of faith. Well then, if one Council might <hi>ſee</hi> what another did not without prejudice to the object, then S. <hi>Ierome</hi> might not ſee, or <hi>Luther,</hi> what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, without prejudice to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of Scripture. Yea, it is not yet proved that
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:40740:386"/> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> accounted the Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> as Canonical as other Books. But this is <hi>actum agere.</hi> And again he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats what he hath not done. Let them not trouble us, for they have loſt their ſtrength.</p>
            <p>And yet again S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel.<note place="margin">N. 46.</note> He had better have ſolidly proved, which he ſleightly puts off the proof of, in the end of the laſt ſection, that they do not <hi>prove the infallibility of the Church firſt by Scripture.</hi> I aſſure them this is a Fort-royal: and therefore this ſhould be made good at all hands.</p>
            <p>Well but let us ſee his <hi>Argument</hi> in the face, about S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel: which he ſaies <hi>he hath forced a paſsage to.</hi> Surely he had no ſuch reaſon to rally and obtrude this Argument again, and to be ſo confident of it, as to <hi>ſay boldly</hi> that it <hi>cannot poſſibly by</hi> our <hi>Principles ever come to be believed with an infallible aſſent to be Gods true uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word.</hi> Why not? Nay here is all of this, no proof. We looked for a Spear like a Weavers Beam, or elſe ſome new Sword, whereby the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> thought to have ſlain <hi>David:</hi> but here is none yet. Yea <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>apleton</hi> ſhall ſufficiently anſwer him with a contradiction, as before, who ſaies, It is not abſolutely neceſſary to Faith that it ſhould be produced by the Authority of the Church; but it may be cauſed immediately by the Spirit of God. So then it is poſſible by our Principles to believe it with an infallible aſſent to be the Word of God. And before a Church was formed, how did the material Members believe any point of Faith? then it is poſſible.</p>
            <p>But then he ſlides to another way, as he thought, of urging hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Argument; and that is, <hi>the Marcionites, the Cerdoniſts,</hi> and <hi>the Manichaeans do deny (and others may come to deny) the Goſpel of S.</hi> Matthew <hi>to be Gods true Word.</hi> Yea, but this is another queſtion. It is one thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be Gods Word; and another to prove it to him that denies it to be Gods Word. Now the queſtion in hand is how we believe it to be Gods Word. And
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:40740:387"/> therefore we ſay, as to ſuch, we deal with them as we deal with others who deny any part of Scripture, not by the Authority of the Roman Church (and therefore the Romaniſts get nothing by this Argument) but by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition, as a common Argument; which rather makes a Scholaſtical Faith, than a Faith Divine, of proper name. So that alſo he cannot reaſonably put me in minde again that I cannot credit it to be the Word of God by virtue of the Tranſlation: ſince according to my opinion, <hi>Tranſlations are onely ſo far Gods Word as they agree with the Originals: but we have onely Tranſlations of S.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews <hi>Goſpel, no Original at all.</hi> This we have in places before ſpoken to. But ſuppoſe no Original Copie of Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel: yet this makes no impoſſibility of belief in <hi>Stapletons</hi> judgement, becauſe we may believe immediately without the interpoſal of the Church. And the Tranſlation is conſiderable as an Inſtrument to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Object, not to help the Effect: it hath more relation to the <hi>fides quae,</hi> than the <hi>fides quâ,</hi> to the Faith objective rather than the Faith ſubjective. So that I do not believe the ſenſe to be true for the Tranſlation: but <hi>I beleve</hi> the Tranſlation true becauſe it agrees with the Senſe. And he that made the Originall can Supply it. Again, they belive the Goſpel of St <hi>Matthew.</hi> Do they not? how do they believe it? by the authority of the Church. Well, but what authority had the Church ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther operative or declarative, to make or declare that to be Scripture which was not Scripture? they ſay then, the Church can make tranſlations, and particularly the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar latin to be authentique, but the vulgar is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely authentique by confeſſion of their own men. And beſides the beſt reaſon which could be, had it been true of the vulgar, was this, that that ſhould be authentique, becauſe it was made by the original copies before they were corrupted. Yea, but my adverſaries ſay, there was no original copie of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel: or if there was
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:40740:387"/> they are worthy to die, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Abner</hi> becauſe they have kept their Maſter no better. Are they now the Church unto which <hi>perfidia non poteſt habere acceſſum,</hi> no unfaithfulneſs can have acceſs? Again, if there was not an original copie or no copie of the original, how ſhall we believe their Church to be infallible, ſince the chief place of ſtrength for their Church is found in that Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, 16. <hi>Ch.</hi> 18. as <hi>Perron</hi> would think. Suppoſe the queſtion then be made how they prove their infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Scripture: anſwer is made, by the 16. of St. <hi>Matt.</hi> the 18. Well but we muſt know it firſt to be the word of God before they prove their Church infallible by it. Now they are at as great a loſs as we, for they cannot prove that Text to be the word of God by the infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, becauſe the infallibility of the Church is in queſtion, if that be not before hand aſſured to us that it is the word of God. If then at length they have a mind to reſt themſelves in common argumentative principles, and reſolve their perſwaſion of it to be the word of God upon the credit of univerſal tradition; ſo do we, as to this kind of perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Whereas then they ſay, <hi>It is uncertain who the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator was, and of what skill and honeſty,</hi> we anſwer, this makes more againſt them. For if a Divine Faith be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as they mightily aſſert, then it is reaſon that we ſhould leſs relie upon humane arguments, which make but humane faith: and therefore for our private aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſhould believe it upon Gods own authority.</p>
            <p>To that they ſay, <hi>If there were one Hebrew Copie,</hi> then (in St. <hi>Ierom's</hi> time) <hi>what is that to our purpoſe now?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt, that this may abate their confidence of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute negative. 2. If thoſe of <hi>Beraea</hi> did gratifie St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> with the uſe of that Hebrew Copy, it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that as the former <hi>Beraeans</hi> were diligent in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures whether thoſe things ſpoken by St. <hi>Paul</hi> were true, ſo thoſe would take care to conſign it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If he had the liberty by the <hi>Nazaraeans</hi> to deſcribe it (as before) then ſurely of that Autograph, St. <hi>Ierome</hi> would have made an Apograph, he would have made another copy. And 4. If the tranſlation they ſo much brag of were his, they know <hi>what skill and honeſty</hi> the Tranſlator was of. So then they are brought to this either to take my anſwer, or to deny their tranſlation, which they will. And <hi>all</hi> their <hi>ſhifts will not help them.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 47.</note>Here he would put me out of my ſhifts, as he calls them. I asked them, how they were ſure of their latin interpretation to be authentique: they ſay now <hi>by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former ages.</hi> Well, but we are ſatisfied thus alſo by way of argument concerning the Scriptures and in particular concerning the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> We ſay alſo that we are infallibly ſatisfied herein by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. And this way of faith I hope we may aſſert. we may believe what we cannot prove; as they believe that Roman Faith which they cannot prove.</p>
            <p>But he ſaies we are incapacitated to make uſe of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>This tradition doth not cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo conſequently, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to you, becauſe you hold it infallible. So it muſt it ſeems be. You do not hold it becauſe it is infallible: but it is infallible becauſe you hold it. And thus infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſhall not make faith: but opinion ſhall make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. I had thought before, that verity had been fundamentally in things, and that things had not been true becauſe we conceive them ſo, but our conceits had been true becauſe things are ſo. Surely it is a better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Roman Faith cannot be certified to them, becauſe their principles are uncertain, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then that <hi>tradition cannot certifie</hi> us, <hi>becauſe we hold it fallible.</hi> If it be infallible, we are as ſure as they, in the certitude of the object; though becauſe we think it falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:40740:388"/> we are not certain <hi>certitudine ſubjecti,</hi> in the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſubject, <hi>valeat quantum valere poteſt.</hi> And why would they have us ſure of our faith in the certainty of the ſubject, and yet ſcarce allow a certainty of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the certitude of the object? But then 2. They are ſure by the <hi>tradition of former ages,</hi> namely univerſal tradition they mean, do they not? if ſo univerſal traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion includes all places, then how comes infallibility to be the prerogative of their Church, when they are to prove their faith by univerſal tradition. 3. It ſeems they do not hold tradition to be infallible (and therefore by their own argument, it cannot certifie them) ſince that which was held in the Church univerſally for the firſt ages, they do not now hold, as they have been told, namely the millenary opinion, infant communion, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up in prayer from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> Yea why do they not ſtand up altogether at prayer as was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Council? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. 4. If they mean the terme [certifie] as infallibly, we grant it: if they mean it morally, we deny it: and therefore if they have no more certainty then of tradition for their faith, they have no faith of proper name. 5. We are upon the ſurer ground to truſt upon the Scripture, becauſe the Church muſt be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to it, then they, becauſe they truſt to the Church for the truth of Scripture. For if this were right then the Church might have that priviledge, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not claim to himſelf, namely to be miſtreſs of our faith: whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> denies it 2. Ep. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Not as Maſters of your Faith, but helpers of your joy. And we have <hi>Eſtius</hi> alſo of our opinion, as before, that all faith hath not the authority of the Church for the formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, this is enough againſt his firſt ſhift, <hi>the ſecond ſhift is, this Goſpel might poſſibly at the firſt be written in Greek,</hi> and here he asks me <hi>whether poſſibilities grounded upon conjectures be ſufficient to ground an infallible aſſent.</hi>
               <pb n="868" facs="tcp:40740:389"/> We anſwer, no, but exceptions of a poſſibility of error are ſufficient to contradict infallibility. They ſay they have an infallible faith; we ſay there is a poſſibility of error herein: and this is enough for us againſt them. And then 2. This weapon we uſe againſt you, <hi>Poſſibilities grounded upon conjectures</hi> are not <hi>ſufficient to ground an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſent:</hi> This it ſeems is their own poſition, now they have nothing but poſſibilities for them; therefore they have no infallible aſſent. This aſſumption hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before upon their own principles. We have nothing but poſſibilities grounded upon conjectures, that they have a right Pope, legitimate in his Baptiſme and prieſthood; and ſo of other Prieſts, there might be want of due mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, due form, due intention; which with them make the act null.</p>
            <p>But then he compares the inevidence of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel to be the <hi>uncorrupted word of God,</hi> with the evidence of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel to be ſuch by its own light, and would have me think as much reaſon to believe the inevidence of the latter, as I doe of the former, but 1. he doth not rightly to compare the evidence of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel with the inevidence of St. <hi>Matthew's</hi> as he would have me graunt. As if becauſe I ſuppoſed an inevidence which was the original, I alſo graunted an inevidence of the Goſpel, and yet faith doth not exclude a negative inevidence, there may be certitude of aſſent without evidence of the object, therefore we ſay 2. We are rather aſſured of the language by the Scripture, then of the Scripture by the language, otherwiſe the ignorant people could have no faith of Scripture. 3. We can give, upon our own principles, as much credit to the Church (as to the point of the originall language) as the Church can require or they prove. 4. How did the Church firſt accept it to be the word of God, whether the Greek was the originall or not. By the internall teſtimonie of the ſpirit, it muſt be ſaid. For if it ſhould be ſaid we
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:40740:389"/> receive now by tradition of former ages, this is forecluded, becauſe we ask the queſtion how the firſt Church accepted it, if not by the ſpirit of God internally aſſuring them, then let them tell us how they came to the faith thereof, not opinion: if ſo, then why may we not receive it ſo too. And moreover, it doth not follow that if the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> were originally greek, therefore we ſhould ſee it to be ſo as well as St. <hi>Luke? A poſſe ad eſſe non valet. Multa videntur quae non ſunt: multa ſunt quae non videntur.</hi> Many things ſeem which are not: many things are which are not ſeen. Every <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiated underſtanding</hi> of theirs doth not ſee all points which belong to their Church. Some do ſee the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of the Church to be as <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> ſome do not ſee the Monarchy of the Church, as <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> notes. Again, how came it to paſs that the former Churches did not ſee the Apocryphal books to be Gods true and uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word: and yet ſome Church of later times hath ſeen them? ſuch anſwers of mine would be repetitions; were they not anſwers to his repetitions.</p>
            <p>Nextly he comes to my argument (which I did not make much of, but he leſs) that the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matt.</hi> was written in Greek, <hi>becauſe the Greek copie doth interpret the word</hi> Immanuel, <hi>which if it were written in Hebrew, needed not any interpretation.</hi> But my Adverſary might have added, if he had pleaſed, that which followes in my Paper [ſince the letters of the word put together without any variation do make that ſignification] And this we called not a demonſtration, nor a probability, but rather a poſſibility by that reaſon. And therefore unleſs he did make all things invincible by infallibility, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to have called it a <hi>pittiful weak conjecture.</hi> Well, but what ſaid he? <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>He anſwers then, <hi>it is manifeſt that tranſlations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſually tell us the Hebrew word firſt, and then the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it,</hi> ſo Gen. Bi. 48. Galaad <hi>id eſt tumulus teſtis.</hi>
               <pb n="870" facs="tcp:40740:390"/> Not to take any notice of the Scribe; he puts here that in the way of interpretation, which is there delivered in way of a cauſe, and reaſon of the terme. Ver. 47. but <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> called it <hi>Galeed;</hi> then 48. for <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid this heap is witneſs between me and thee this day, therefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the name of it <hi>Galeed.</hi> And before the name which <hi>Laban</hi> gave it in <hi>Chaldee, Segar Sahudatha,</hi> is not there interpreted, although there be a little difference between that and the name which <hi>Iacob</hi> gave it in Hebrew: for <hi>Galeed</hi> ſignifies the heap of witnes, the other heap his witnes. Therefore whereas he would make <hi>[Galaad, id eſt tumulus teſtis]</hi> to be in termes Scripture, it is not ſo.

Another inſtance (and indeed in order before the laſt) is <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.18. <hi>Benoni i.e. filius doloris mei,</hi> Benjamin <hi>id filius dextrae.</hi> But here alſo he preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuppoſeth his vulgar latin to be Scripture, which is to ſuppoſe that which is not to be ſuppoſed; and indeed a ſophiſm in begging that which is in queſtion: none of all languages which the great Bible ſet out with us hath, doth put in theſe words in form of an expoſition. The Syria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k and the Arabick and the Greek doe expreſs the matter of the interpretation; but then they leave out the name <hi>Benoni:</hi> but all keep <hi>Benjamin</hi> without any interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Another inſtance of his is <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.15, 31. <hi>Manna quod ſign ficat quid eſt hoc.</hi> And here again he takes the vulgar Latin for good Scripture: for none give the terme and afterwards t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſignification but the Latin: but the name <hi>Manna</hi> they do not name. And whether that be the ſignification of <hi>Manna</hi> deſerves a criticiſm. Some think
<pb n="871" facs="tcp:40740:390"/> that it may come from the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; and ſo it ſhould ſignifie a portion; neither is <hi>Bethel</hi> interpreted upon the place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.15.</p>
            <p>So then, upon the whole matter, that which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently ſaies being not ſo in his own Inſtances and more, my conjecture is yet true and good; unleſs they can make the Latine Tranſlation to be as Catholique Scripture as they would have the Pope to be univerſal Biſhop. And ſurely if a Tranſlator of Scripture doth tranſlate words of Scripture (where the words are not interpreted in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) he is not a Tranſlator of Scripture, <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, but materially of that which is Scripture. And this is not to render Scripture ſo much as to make it. And moreover they may know this to be the uſage of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts beſides (which are acknowledged to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten originally in Greek) to give the Interpretation of the Hebrew or Syriack words. My conjecture then is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of its weakneſs.</p>
            <p>But then he falls upon me for giving a contradiction to S. <hi>Ierom. Though he ſaith he did ſee a copie of the Hebrew O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal with his own eyes: you reject him though all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Writings extant ſtand on his ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A conjecture of a poſſibility of the contrary makes no ſuch contradiction which ſtands betwixt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and negation categorically. 2. S. <hi>Ierom</hi> then hath rather contradicted them, if a conjecture be ſufficient to a contradiction. For can we conceive that there is not room enough for a conjecture, that either that Copie which S. <hi>Ierom</hi> had uſe of, or that which he deſcribed (which may be as certain as ſome other) may now be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the world; which contradicts my Adverſary. 3. If there were an Hebrew Copie, it is more than a conjecture, it is more than probable that he who tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it into Greek, did exactly compare it with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, whoſe faithfulneſs, in thoſe times, we might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truſt than ſome Romans now. And alſo they know that
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:40740:391"/> the Pope may be deceived in point of fact. Neither did all the Fathers, I ſuppoſe, ſee the Hebrew Copie. And it would have been enough, that none of the Fathers are againſt it: but it is a greater adventure to ſay, all the Fathers ſtand on that ſide. And alſo they may know what Father did profeſs that he did ſee the remainers of thoſe cells, in which the <hi>Seventy</hi> did tranſlate the Old Teſtament, and who contemns that teſtimony. I think I bear as much reſpect to the Fathers, as ſome of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> do, or more: but yet if I ſhould hold with the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the Fathers that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was the univerſal Biſhop, I ſhould not be blamed for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the Fathers.</p>
            <p>But to his Argument, <hi>This Copie tranſlateth,</hi> ergo, <hi>it is a tranſlation. Anſw.</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Antecedent begs the queſtion, whether it doth tranſlate or not. Whatſoever doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret doth not tranſlate. And therefore here is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for me, It doth not tranſlate, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. And it doth not tranſlate: for then the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation muſt be in the Hebrew, which is denied to have been the uſe of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as before; eſpecially in the ſame caſe, where the name is given in the ſame letters which ſignifie the interpretation. Therefore the Latine doth not tranſlate, when it giveth the Interpretation, as in the former examples. And the other Evangeliſts are not Tranſlators, when they interpret Hebrew or Syriack words. So his Argument is for me. And ſo my <hi>cauſe</hi> is not <hi>loſt,</hi> as to this point: ſince alſo S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſed in that of his againſt the Epiſtle of the <hi>Manichean,</hi> that he would hear Reaſon againſt <hi>Antiquity:</hi> at leaſt ſurely he might do ſo in matter of fact.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your third ſhift is in place of giving anſwer to make an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, asking why our Latine Tranſlation was made authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, if the Church had made the Greek authentique. Anſw.</hi> Shall I ſay that my Adverſary doth not ſeem here to know well what ſhift to make: ſince he carps at my
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:40740:391"/> anſwering by way of queſtion? But then they ſhould be better adviſed than to make ſuch Arguments as they will not be willing to anſwer an intergatory about in the ſame matter. But he ſaies (paſſing by ſome other words which ſeem too hot for him) <hi>I know of no body who told you that the Greek Tranſlation was made authentique by the Church.</hi> I return upon him. Was the Greek Tranſlation made au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique or not? He is not willing to ſay it was nor it was not. But I preſs them. Was it? or was it not? If it was not, then their Tranſlation was not of authentique Scripture: and ſo, again, they do not tranſlate but make Scripture. If it was made authentique by the Church, then what need of two authentique Tranſlations? Again, if it were not made authentique by the Church, then the Church could be without the authentique Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and yet have enough for ſalvation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can we be as well without Traditions of the Church, becauſe I preſume they profeſs ſo much reverence to the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that they will not ſay that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more neceſſary than the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> And if it were made authentique abſolutely by the Church: we can better believe it by the vertue of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition, than they can believe their Latine by the authority of the Roman Church. And if it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as it is, that Tranſlations, as ſuch, <hi>ſhould agree with Originals,</hi> and the queſtion be which is the Original, or where the Original is to be found, they are in as great difficulty as we: for then they have no certainty of an Original, as to this Goſpel, to make uſe of for their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. And if their Latine, as to this, was a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Tranſlation: we have the better cauſe in this, becauſe we truſt rather to the firſt Tranſlation. And if ſome part of the Church made uſe of the Septuagints Tranſlation in ſtead of the Hebrew, and the Pen-men of the New Teſtament made ſo much uſe of it alſo, as is confeſſed by learned men; then may we rather make uſe
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:40740:392"/> of the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> in Greek than they in Latine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your fourth ſhift is to pretend to this knowledge by the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with other Goſpels.</hi> Anſ. A great deal he ſaies to this, which I might ſpare the refutation of upon theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe I compare the harmony of this Goſpel to the other Goſpels, with the credit of the Church, therefore do I not make this to be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abſolute. 2. Becauſe I ſpoke of the harmony betwixt this and other Goſpels, and not betwixt this Goſpel and other parts of ſcripture: and therefore he playes the Sophiſter, the diſcourſe is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. whereas then he does deny my Argument by compare of it with other Goſpels, he does not contradict me in my concluſion, which was comparative to the credit of the Church. And where he compares the harmonie of this Coſpel with other parts of Scripture, he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude contradictorily to me, who onely inſtituted the compare of it with other Goſpels. It is neceſſary therfore to ſet down my words, which were theſe. <q>Again the harmony of it with other Goſpels hath more in it to perſwade faith than the credit of the Church.</q> So that all his diſputation as to this is peccant in the ignorance of the Elench, becauſe it comes not up to a contradiction to my terms. And beſides, if the difficulties about the agreement, were ſo great, their infallibility pretended ſhould have cleared them. Either we might have ſaving health notwithſtanding thoſe breaches, or elſe the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was defective, or elſe there is want of care in the Phyſitian. Or it may be as he ſaid, <hi>Plus periculi a medico qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a morbo,</hi> but let them take my own termes in their ordinary ſence, and then his aſſaults will loſe their force before they come home to the point. For what if one <hi>who intended a ſuppoſititious Goſpel would take care not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the others?</hi> Is not therefore the harmonie of this Goſpel with others a better perſwaſive than the credit of the
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:40740:392"/> Church? For the Argument from the Church is more extrinſical, and ſuch Arguments are in kind leſs rational. And if they ſay the Church hath an infallible aſſiſtance, it beggs the queſtion.</p>
            <p>And what infringement of the harmony is it, if there be <hi>many things related by St. Matthew,</hi> and not related at all by many others? For ſo, they would not find an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the other Goſpels: and this according to Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> would make this Goſpel more credible, becauſe more things are here expreſſed, and it may be ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. But ſurely to relate circumſtances and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late circumſtances, namely the ſame, makes no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in diverſe ſubjects, if one did ſay theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were, and another did ſay theſe circumſtances were not, this would contradict: but not to ſay, is not to ſay not. For not to ſay is negative <hi>ex parte actus:</hi> but to ſay not, is negative <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> which makes the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in diverſe ſubjects. Again what if there ſeem to be any variety betwixt the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and other parts of Scripture (he ſhould have ſaid and other Goſpels, if he would have ſpoken <hi>ad idem</hi>) in the Hiſtory of the generations, muſt <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichaean</hi> be gratified in honour to the Roman Church. If there be any ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, the Roman will have the worſt of it: for his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation lies principally in that Goſpel. And this cannot be ſalved by the Church, becauſe the Church is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>But he will not ſpare the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (as if the Roman Church needed it not) and therefore he tells us of a diſagreement in the firſt <hi>chap.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew's</hi> Goſpel with the 2. b. of the Kings the 8th. ch. about <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram's</hi> begetting <hi>Ozias, Ioram begat</hi> Ozias, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, if the Roman calls children Nephews, more reaſonably may the Hebrews call real Nephews children, which are as minor ſons, as he ſaid. And ſo <hi>Ioram</hi> might be ſaid
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:40740:393"/> to beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t <hi>Ozias,</hi> who was his <hi>Abnepos.</hi> Or will not <hi>Salmerons</hi> conceit pleaſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this was ſo ordered in an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, to typifie that as 3 Kings are excluded in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo thoſe that deny the doctrine of the Trinity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of the three Theological vertues do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be excluded ſalvation. But ſince, it ſeems it was the ſpirit of Gods purpoſe to put the account in teſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodecades, it was neceſſary that in one of them, three ſhould be left out. And convenient it was that the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be in the ſecond, that ſo that curſe upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> family ſhould be here exemplified, thoſe three Kings being of his poſterity: ſomewhat as <hi>Dan</hi> in the ſeventh of the <hi>Revel.</hi> is not numbred; becauſe that Tribe did go away from God in Idolatry, and did mingle with the Gentiles, as is obſerved.</p>
            <p>Another difficultie he urgeth about the number of the Generations, wherein one ſeems to be wanting, <hi>you ſhall finde them to be only fortie one;</hi> which by the account of thrice fourteen Generations ſhould make fortie two. Anſ. Our queſtion is about the harmonie of the Goſpel in the point of doctrine cheifly, this concerns hiſtorie of fact, 2. We have no reaſon to thinke that becauſe we cannot comprehend all the myſteries in ſcripture and the waies of the jewiſh acount, there ſhould be any falſitie herein. <hi>Tertullians'</hi> rule is good, <hi>Cedat Curioſitas fidei.</hi> 3. <hi>Stapulenſis,</hi> it ſeems, ſaid that in old copies it is found thus, <hi>Ioſias genuit Ioaechim; Ioaechim genuit Iechoniam</hi> and theſe two are comprehended under one name.

An errour of the ſcribe cannot diſcanonize the book in a point of circumſtance, if it were ſo as it might be, if the Goſpel was firſt written in Hebrew? for then <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by the hand of the Prophet. Or it may be 2. As ſome note, they were wont to put ſeverall books to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to name all by the firſt. So <hi>Ieremie</hi> being firſt all were reckoned by him: and ſo that which is ſaid by <hi>Zecharie</hi> is attributed to <hi>Ieremie</hi> too being the firſt. And ſo we know that in the old Teſtament books are called by the firſt words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And 3. However this agrees with the Scripture in generall, though not particularly in termes with <hi>Ieremie.</hi> His other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are about the difference of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> denying his maſter, which compared with other Evangeliſts, ſeemes <hi>to differ in very many Circumſtances;</hi> and then alſo in the laſt <hi>chap.</hi> He ſaies there are <hi>ſome Circumſtances</hi> about the reſurrection, which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> differs from the reſt in: Anſ. Theſe are ſpoken by him in generall, and <hi>Generalia non agunt</hi> as it is ſaid, neither do they make an action. And then 2. Somewhat may be diverſe which is not adverſe. And what one ſayes another doth not denie. If another omiſſion did make a contradiction to what one affirmes, then, if St. <hi>Ierom</hi> had called the Biſhop of Rome the univerſall Biſhop, (which yet he doth not) then St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> not calling him ſo, had contradicted him. But then the ſuppoſed differences are about <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> by his own confeſſion. What is this to matter of faith in neceſſary doctrine; which is the center point of the queſtion, unto which all the lines ſhould be referred, and therfore he had done nothing, if he had done more in this kinde. And I
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:40740:394"/> thinke we are as ſure of the right in ſuch varieties as they. And alſo he might have remembred that rule of Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> of Jeruſalem <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> let things of curioſitie not be ſpoken of in the Church.</p>
            <p>But the ſenſe of them is, that we muſt be Papiſts or no Chriſtians. But if they were Turks we might ſay more. And where nothing is neceſſarie, any thing is abundant.</p>
            <p>He comes next to my laſt ſhift, as he calleth it, that the <hi>people doe fix their faith upon that which is interpreted, not upon the interpretation.</hi> To this he objects thus, <hi>you may fix your faith upon a lie, for how know you whether the thing delivered you by the interpreter, be Gods word or the interpreters own word, ſpecially when we know not who this interpreter was, how skilful, how faithful, how true a copie he uſed.</hi> Anſ. To the confirmation of what he here objects againſt, were added diſtinct reaſons or reaſonable diſtinctions. Theſe he ſaies nothing to, but what cavil he can make againſt the concluſion; he is willing to, without anſwer to my reaſons, 2. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our people can better believe the word of God in a tranſlation, than their people without a tranſlation, for the people muſt believe their Church without the knowledge of any tranſlation. Let them make their faith good without a tranſlation: and we ſhall make our faith as good in a tranſlation. And I think our people may as well credit the Authority of our Church in a tranſlation as their people may credit the Authority of their Church without a tranſlation. 3. By their own Argument they are more in the dark: for if the perſwaſive of our faith be the certainty, <hi>who this interpreter was, how skilful, how faithful, how true a copy he uſed:</hi> becauſe they do not know who the interpreter of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel was into Greek, how skilful, how faithful, how true a copy he uſed, how can they believe it? And therefore we return
<pb n="878" facs="tcp:40740:394"/> him his own words, how know you that <hi>this tranſlation doth not conveigh</hi> their <hi>own fanſies in the place of Gods word. Do they know it becauſe their fanſie</hi> (of their Church) <hi>tells</hi> them <hi>that this is Gods word? Thus then</hi> they <hi>may have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble phantaſtical aſſurance and nothing elſe. This</hi> they <hi>are forced to hold ſufficient. Yet how doth this agree with</hi> their <hi>own acknowledgements,</hi> that the vulgar latin as to this is alſo a tranſlation: and yet, (as they muſt confeſs) that it is ſo far a true tranſlation <hi>as it doth agree with the original.</hi> They <hi>cannot reſolve their faith into the original never propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to</hi> them. <hi>Into the tranſlation</hi> they <hi>ſay</hi> they <hi>do reſolve it.</hi> And this muſt be the <hi>written word. What written word is that which is neither tranſlation nor original?</hi> For the Greek is neither their tranſlation nor their original. And yet ſurely the Greek is more like to be the original than the latin: for if there was no Hebrew copie extant, as they ſay, then was the Latin a tranſlation out of the Greek. And if they ſay the Greek was not the original then the Latin is a tranſlation without an original, which is <hi>oppoſitum in appoſito.</hi> So then, when all comes to all, we are as well ſetled in the tenure of our aſſurance, as to the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as they, or more; becauſe we ſtand to that which they have but a tranſlation of. And they have but the Latin Church for their Latin: we have the univerſal Church for the Greek. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, they believe their Church to be infallible: we do not believe the Church to be infallible. But what then? if the authority of the Church were creſcent according to the opinion of the recipient, then the Scripture had not been the word of God unleſs men had thought ſo. And then opinion would make faith: becauſe it would make infallibility. As then they muſt ſay that their Church was aſſured by the Holy Ghoſt (for ſo the termes of their Synod run, <hi>Haec ſacroſancta Oecumenica &amp; generalis Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus in ſpiritu ſancto legitime congregata</hi>) that their Latin tranſlation i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, if it be at all, authentique: ſo may we ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
<pb n="880" facs="tcp:40740:395"/> believe the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> to be in the matter of it, authentique. For if there be not ſufficient aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God to Chriſtians ſeverally, as to neceſſity of Salvation, how did the Chriſtians do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was ever a general Council?</p>
            <p>What is added hereabouts might have been ſpoken without Sarcaſmes, or might have been left out. <hi>We can know which of thoſe ſo many Greek Copies is the onely true one as well as they.</hi> And <hi>a clown</hi> will be as able to underſtand which is the beſt <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> (as if there were ſuch difference) as well as with them he can underſtand which is a right General Council, or which was in the right as to the varieties in the Latine, <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> or <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth. And though they cannot confer the Tranſlation <hi>with the Original;</hi> No more can the <hi>Roman</hi> People compare their Tranſlation with the Originals: and yet <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as before, ſaies in ſome caſes, we muſt have recourſe to the Originals. But did not <hi>Xavier</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Infidels? yes, they will ſay. So then. And did he not preach that which is in the Bible? Yes, they will ſay. And did not they believe? Yes, they will ſay. Now then how was this Faith wrought in them? By the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, they will ſay, or they muſt ſay. For they could not compare that which was ſaid by him with the Originals or with the Doctrine of the Church. So then our people can believe without conferring a Tranſlation with the Originals, as well as theirs. And they know who ſaid, <hi>Si fides in doctos ſelos caderet, nihil eſſet paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Deo.</hi> And again, <hi>Surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt coelum, &amp;c.</hi> as the Father. The very neck then of this point may be thus reſolved. In the order of credibles their firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, The Church is infallible. Our firſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, The Scripture is the Word of God. Now their Propoſition is grounded in Authority: or elſe is believed by its own light. Not by its own light; for then the Scripture may be believed ſo, which they deny. Then it
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:40740:395"/> is grounded in Authority. That, either Humane or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. Humane Authority cannot make Faith. No Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, but either that of Scripture; or internal, by the Holy Ghoſt. Not by Scripture, then that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theirs is not the firſt. Then by the Holy Ghoſt: and then by the ſame way we believe the Scripture to be the Word of God, as they believe the Church to be infallible. And ſo they muſt at length reſt in our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>In this num. (beſide ſomewhat in the beginning,<note place="margin">N. 48.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before) he would very fain repair the credit of the vulgar Latin, which I had broken by an inſtance of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. where it reads <hi>ipſa</hi> for <hi>ipſum;</hi> referring to the Mother what belongs to the Son. To this he ſaies, <hi>It is clear ſome Hebrew copies may moſt exactly be tranſlated</hi> ipſum. <hi>How know you the Church followed the falſe Hebrew copie?</hi> Satis caute. <hi>Some copies. Not all. May be.</hi> Not are. <hi>Moſt exactly be tranſlated,</hi> not ſome moſt exact copies. Well. Are not theſe copies the greater number? And indeed are they not the moſt exact? yea can they truly be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated otherwiſe? and how know they that their Church followed the true Hebrew copie? If it did not follow it infallibly; or if they cannot know infallibly that it did follow it infallibly, infallibly they are undone; becauſe they are upon terms of an infallible faith in an infallible Church. Therefore though we can ſhake their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by our queſtion; they cannot ſettle their foundation by their queſtion. And yet we have another queſtion. He asks again, <hi>How many moſt grave and moſt antient Fathers have alſo read</hi> ipſa? Surely he does well to ask how many, becauſe he does not know how few. Their names may they not be written in a nut ſhel? and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> upon the place, hath not many for it. And ſome of them ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely not moſt grave and alſo moſt ancient Fathers. But as for St. <hi>Auſtin, Bellarmin,</hi> might as well or better have left him out of the Catalogue. For though he renders it,

               <hi>ipſa,</hi> in his 11. <hi>de Gen. ad literam c.</hi> 36. and in another place; yet he doth not expound it, as they of the Virgin, for he makes it to be myſtically underſtood. <hi>Significatur ſemine diaboli perverſa, ſemine autem mulieris fructus boni operis: &amp; illa obſervat caput ejus ut eum in ipſo initio malae ſuaſionis excludat.</hi> He might alſo have omitted St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> in his 2. b. <hi>de fuga ſaeculi cap.</hi> 7. for there he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it morally, not referring it to the Virgin. And both of them alſo differ from the Hebrew and their vulgar in the other words, and follow the Septuagint. For they tranſlate it, <hi>ipſa ſervabit caput tuum,</hi> which doth not agree with the Hebrew, with which the vulgar, in this, doth agree. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo nameth St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his 17. homily upon <hi>Gen.</hi> But then they muſt have ſome other edition of him if they will make uſe of his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for them.

               </gap>. Thus <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth not yet bring <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. indeed all they can do is much too little to cure this breach. For S. <hi>Ierom</hi> is more conſiderable in this criticiſm than all the Fathers named. And he ſaies, <hi>melius in Hebraeo, ipſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret caput tuum.</hi> Nay <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in the place quoted by him, ſaith he had ſeen one copy (he ſpeaks of no more, as he would ſurely if he had could) and yet doth not tell us where. So that, to ſpeak at leaſt <hi>de communi</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this reading <hi>ipſa;</hi> is not agreeable to the Hebrew copies. Nay <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth ſweat at it; and therefore ſaies ſome copies of the vulgar Latin do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it <hi>ipſe,</hi> in the former Chap. And this makes a new difficulty on their part to reconcile the contrariety to the
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:40740:396"/> infallibility of the Church in both. The Church was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in one, and where then is their infallibility they ſpeak of? This is their modeſty then, againſt the gender in the Hebrew, againſt the Samaritan, Syriack, Arabick, tranſlations, which referre it to the ſeed, againſt all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew copies which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had ſeen but one, againſt ſome of their own copies of the vulgar Latin, to make that Scripture for the Creature, which belongs to the Son of God.</p>
            <p>And alſo whether the Fathers <hi>moſt grave and moſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> are for their interpretation, we have examined and therefore he needed not be ſo plain as to ſay <hi>it was a loud lie of</hi> Chemnitius <hi>to ſay the contrary:</hi> And will they ſay ſo to <hi>Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> who ſaies as much as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in this point, almoſt all the Fathers do read <hi>ipſe,</hi> as is noted. Let me then ſay, it would become them here to give glory to Chriſt immediately, and to confeſs this fault.</p>
            <p>And yet neither doth he competently anſwer to the queſtion made to him, why the Greek was not made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly the Church as well as the Latin. <hi>That we have his declaration that the Latin vulgar is authentique and not deficient in any point concerning faith or manners,</hi> this he ſaies: but this will not ſerve, as may appear thus. A tranſlation of that which is not authentique cannot be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique; now let them determine whether it was made authentique or not. If not made authentique, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tranſlation (as they ſay) then how can the Latin be ſo declared an authentique tranſlation? for then the Church muſt have <hi>vim operativam</hi> too, not onely declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: and the effect ſhall exceed the material cauſe. Or if it was declared authentique, what of an infallible tranſlation. 2. Whereas he ſaies therefore <hi>it is not deficient in any point neceſſarie to faith and manners.</hi> To wit the Latin tranſlation, we take notice of it that theſe words have a ſenſe in them intended for their uſe; namely not to be underſtood abſolutely, as if there were
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:40740:397"/> no error at all therein: but reſtrictively, ſpecificatively, no ſuch errour but that it may be ſufficient to direct us in <hi>faith and manners.</hi> So then, when he hath made uſe of his own words for his own turne, we will make uſe of them for our purpoſe, and we will not ſqueeſe them neither.</p>
            <p>The firſt corollarie then from theſe words of his, is this, that he dares not ſtand to an abſolute infallibilitie of the Church in every point whatſoever: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Mr. <hi>Knott's</hi> argument he muſt abate of his former poſtulate of it's being the ground and cauſe of faith. 2. Thus much we may as well or better ſay for our tranſlation that it is <hi>not deficient in any point neceſſary to faith and manners.</hi> 3. It ſemes then ſalvation is not in danger by ſome errours: otherwiſe their tranſlation ſhould be deficent in points neceſſarie to faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and therefore we need not, upon danger of ſalvation, have an infallible Judge to decide all points emergent. 4. Things neceſſarie to faith and manners are ſufficiently ſet down in ſcripture, for otherwiſe the Latin tranſlation muſt be deficient; or elſe it muſt have more then the orignal; and then, as to this, it is not a tranſlation yet 5. Then neceſſitie of traditions is excluded, for then it could not be truely ſaid that the Latin Bible is not deficient in any point neceſſary to faith and manners. 6. Exceptions againſt St. <hi>Matthew's</hi> Goſpel, which are not <hi>in points neceſſarie to faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> do not hinder the authentickneſs of the Greek; becauſe the Latin is authentick as not being deficient in points neceſſarie to faith and manners. 7. We may infer from hence thus, thoſe errours in the Latin Bible, though not material to faith or manners, might have been ſaved by the Church or not: if they might have been ſaved, then the Church may deceive our truſt, if they could not then it may be deceived: and ſo we have but a <hi>fallible ground</hi> for our aſſent to any of her definitions
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:40740:397"/> and in particular, for the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew. So that all his ſhifts fail</hi> him <hi>in this important point.</hi> Surely this whole point about the belief of Scripture to be the word of God, was a great ſhift of his: for the ſubject ſhould have been ſuppoſed in the diſpute of the attributes. The point in queſtion was whether the Scripture doth clearly propound things neceſſary to Faith and manners. And he hath blotted how much Paper to debate our tenure of the Scripture. Yet it may be, he hath gotten nothing by it, nor by the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> whom he hath ſomewhat to ſay to onely for himſelf.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of this Paragraph comes too late. And all that would ſeem to take away my former An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, is taken away. My Anſwer to his Exception, that <hi>Luther</hi> did not ſee the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> and the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to be canonical, is yet ſufficient; that the negative Argument doth not conclude. He replies, <hi>in</hi> our <hi>caſe it is a ſtrong proof.</hi> I again deny the Conſequence. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have themſelves equally to all: but they are not equally ſeen; ſurely not in <hi>this caſe,</hi> becauſe the Spirit of God is a free Agent. Yea Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the 24.16. their eyes were holden that they could not ſee him. Gods act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon objects, and in degrees, are at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And ſecondly, The ſenſe of the definitions of the Church is viſible, is it not? If not, how are we guided? If ſo, yet every one doth not ſee them. And thirdly, If <hi>Luther</hi> had ſuch an <hi>irradiated</hi> underſtanding, why did he not yet ſee, and <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> alſo, the Monarchy of the Church to be of Divine Right? if he had not, why doth he ſay ſo? <hi>The light is the ſame, the Propoſition is the ſame:</hi> his <hi>eyes or underſtanding no better nor more aſſiſted,</hi> why then did not they ſee what he ſees?</p>
            <p>As to his Anſwer to my ſecond Anſwer [you ſee we do not follow him <hi>(Luther)</hi> blindly] we need not return any thing but this, that he miſtakes me in the terme [blindly] he ſuppoſeth me to ſpeak as in relation to this
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:40740:398"/> point about the Books denied or doubted of by him: but I ſpoke it in general, that we do not follow him with blinde obedience as the Jeſuites do their General.</p>
            <p>And though the <hi>Apocalyps and other Books were doubted of,</hi> this doth not prejudice us, no more than it doth them for the viſibility of the Church, and the reception of the Books Apocryphal, Theſe Books were received by them becauſe they were worthy to be received or not; but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily. If the former, why did not thoſe before ſee them to be ſuch? If the latter, then infallibility pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by the will: and ſo infallibility may be on either part of the contradiction. And ſo we have no reaſon to ſay any more, if whatſoever they <hi>will</hi> ſay, is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
            <p>Further he chargeth us with obtruding <hi>a Canon of our own coyning for Iudge of controverſies.</hi> Here is two things falſe, Firſt, That we obtrude a new Canon. This not ſo, we have the ſame Canon which the ancient Fathers had before the Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi> But they have made a new Canon, by taking in the Apocryphal: and by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonizing the vulgar Latine. And the other is falſe; for we do not obtrude the Scripture, as Judge of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in any formal ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And again he would mar the Canon, <hi>all agreeing that divers Books of the true Canon be quite loſt.</hi> How often comes this in? But firſt, He muſt go leſs: not divers Books, which may import many. One or two are not in common account divers. If then he means by [divers] many Books, ſo <hi>all</hi> do not agree. If he means one or two, ſo not divers. Secondly, He takes the termes <hi>[the true Canon]</hi> either reſpectively to thoſe Divine Books which were inſpired, and yet never put into the Canon, as it was reveiwed by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as learned men ſuppoſe: or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were put in and acknowledged: If the former, he cannot ſay that we have not a true and juſt Canon as to that which is neceſſary. And if he denies it, he is a
<pb n="887" facs="tcp:40740:398"/> friend to <hi>Celaeus, Porphyrie</hi> and <hi>Iulian.</hi> But if the latter, then who loſt them? Surely thoſe who had the minde to keep the reputation of the neceſſary uſe of Traditions upon this account. But if Traditions be but as neceſſary (as the <hi>Trent</hi> Council intends in thoſe terms <hi>pari pietatis affectu</hi>) why may we not think that ſome of theſe may be loſt alſo? and then <hi>where ſhall we finde the Iudge,</hi> who is to determine of points by the tenure of Traditions; or elſe ſome of their moſt acute and learned men have loſt their inſight into ground of truth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amongſt us (after the Church's declaration was notified concerning any book for canonical) you will never finde it to be doubted of by any true Catholick.</hi> Anſ. This argument concludes (if true) unity, but not truth. Things of Divinity are not to be meaſured by ſuch a Lesbian rule.</p>
            <p>And this agreement cannot prove their Canon good, for unles the Canon was good, the agreement was not good. 2. If we ſhould bring things of debate to no other teſt, we ſhould never have any determination. for what is there which is not queſtioned by ſome of them? Now it is all one to the Romaniſts, whether the Canon be queſtioned or any thing elſe which the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, ſince they are bound to believe all alike: but to the point in queſtion. <hi>Gregory</hi> was a true Catholike. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> did not hold the Book of <hi>Machabees</hi> to be canonical, after declaration by the Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> therefore that which he ſaies is falſe. The major was commended to them before the aſſumption, they may ſee in the 19. of his Morals the 15. Ch. Therefore they had beſt hold the Book of <hi>Machabees</hi> to be Canonical onely ſo as to be read in Churches. And if ſo onely (as Saint. <hi>Ierom</hi> alſo held) then this book is not ſimply canonical: if otherwiſe, that which he ſaies is not true; and <hi>Gregory</hi> was not of their opinion. So then we have
<q>—Pares Aquilas &amp; pila minantia pilis,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Pope againſt Pope; infallibility againſt infallibility.
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:40740:399"/> And ſince we know which is right, we muſt deny both.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 50.</note>Here he tels us of an argument in the 14 num. of the former treatiſe, with infallible faith, this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and therefore he beggs the queſtion. And if they cannot prove the cauſe to be theirs with out our free graunt, they are not like to have it. And therefore, this being denied him, as before, all that he would build thereupon muſt fall. to wit, <hi>therefore we muſt be aſſiſted in this infallible knowledge by ſome other infallible means and no other infallible meanes can with any ſhadow of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, be ſaid given to us but the infallible authority of the Church; therefore her athority muſt be infallible, as ſhall at large be ſhewed in the next chap. and then in the next after that, that this infallible Church is the Roman and none but the Roman.</hi> This is all waſt and loſt, unles they could maintain it to be neceſſary charity in us to preſerve their cauſe from ſtarving by graunting that which it ought not to have. And 2. <hi>Dato non conceſto,</hi> ſuppoſe there muſt be ſome other meanes of infallible deciding doubtful ſenſe of Scripture, I can make it a queſtion whether they can plead the next right, as if they came <hi>vacuam poſſeſſionem,</hi> for the place may be ful by univerſal tradition; which ſurely is not the ſame with the Roman Church: for the whole ſurely is greater then the part, and then alſo when you prove the Roman faith by univerſal tradition, you would prove the Roman faith by the Roman, and this is <hi>idem per idem.</hi> And as for the 3. thing, that <hi>this infallible Church is the Roman and none but the Roman,</hi> which he ſaies he will prove in the <hi>laſt chapter;</hi> ſurely, if I may ſpeak it without offence, he does very well to refer it to the laſt: for he may doe any thing before it: But alſo ſince his ſuppoſition, that we cannot be certain by <hi>the Scriptures (infallibly) of their own true ſenſe in points neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with infallible faith,</hi> muſt fall without a better ſupport, we may be at our laſt already, for if this be not good, the other chapters make number.</p>
            <pb n="889" facs="tcp:40740:399"/>
            <p>And this number makes no weight. He doth nothing in it but tell us that he hath done ſo and ſo; which we interpret nothing. Infallibility ſhould not need many words.</p>
            <p>In this,<note place="margin">N. 52.</note> he would wipe off the ſuſpicion of diſreſpect to Scipture in thoſe termes he uſed; and would lay a blame upon me for my cenſure of his words to this purpoſe. <hi>His words</hi> were theſe, <hi>if he would have given us a book for Iudge he would never have given us for our Iudge ſuch a book as Scripture is which very often ſpeaketh obſcurely, ſometimes ſo prophetically that moſt would think it ſpake of the preſent time, when it ſpeaketh of the time to come; that it ſpeaketh of one perſon, for example of</hi> David, <hi>when it ſpeaketh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for example of Chriſt. And much more I added to this effect; that I might be rightly understood when I ſaid that God would never have given us ſuch a book for our judge.</hi> To what of this he ſaid in his former treatiſe, I ſaid Sir, <q>Let me have leave to ſpeak affectionately to you. Do not you ſee what diſreſpects of Scripture (if not blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) your opinion doth miſerably betray you to, if you follow it. Would any ſober man let fall ſuch words, as if God had intended the Scripture for our judge, ſuch a book as Scripture is.</q> So you. This I ſaid.</p>
            <p>And now he examins theſe words ſtrictly, and ſaies. <hi>My adverſary, to avoide this argument, ſo mangleth the ſenſe that he may-make my words ſound of a blaſphemous diſreſpect, reporting them as if I ſhould have ſaid, if God had intended Scripture for our Iudge, he would not have given us ſuch a book as Scripture.</hi> Anſ. Surely this is a falſe charge that I have mangled his words, for I have given the full ſenſe of them. And this may be demonſtrated by denying of the end, which he makes to be, <hi>to avoide</hi> the <hi>argument.</hi> For I do not ſee any ſuch difficulty in the argument, that I ſhould decline it and fall upon the perſon. This is not my mind or manner. But I could find fault with his dealing with me even here: for he puts together that which I did not put
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:40740:400"/> together. For he ſaies I accuſed him of a blaſphemous diſreſpect, whereas I ſaid [diſreſpect [if not blaſphemies] and alſo the termes [if not blaſphemies] without a grain of charity might have been conſtrued without an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Nether doth he right me or clear himſelf in the proſecution of his defence. For my words in all reaſon, doe repreſent as much as if I had added what he ſaid I ſhould have added. Theſe words, [if God had intended a book for our Iudge, he would not have given us ſuch a book as Scripture] muſt connotate this ſenſe, that he would not have given us ſuch a book as Scripture for our Iudge. And therefore he needed not to quarrel upon the omiſſion as if I had not dealt fairely with him, conſider, it in the form of an hypothetical propoſition [if God had intended a book for our Iudge, he would not have given us ſuch a book as Scripture is] what need be added [for our Iudge] when it is underſtood of courſe. They know the rule <hi>Quod neceſſario ſubintelligitur, nunquam deeſt.</hi> That which is neceſſarily underſtood is never wanting. And therefore have I not done his words any injury by mangling them: nor yet by interpretation of them ſtill <hi>they ſeem to ſound ſuch an imperfect book as Scripture:</hi> and muſt do ſo, if they have full ſenſe in them. But alſo if we might ſay what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Heretiques words, Bene haec acciperentur niſi ab eo dicerentur cujus ſenſus notus eſt;</hi> ſo here, theſe words might be better conſtrued if they were not ſpoken by ſuch whoſe ſenſe was known. For unleſs the Scripture be a book imperfect in regard of matter, what need of tradition? unleſs the Scripture were imperfect in regard of cleareneſs, what needed an infallible judge to decide controverſies about the ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore he cannot get clearely off. <hi>Aqua haeret.</hi> And ſurely he doth not helpe himſelf or his cauſe by a like caſe he puts, <hi>if God had intended the Scripture for ſole Iudge in Law controverſies, he would never have given us ſuch a book as Scripture is for our Iudge.</hi> Doth this paſſe
<pb n="891" facs="tcp:40740:400"/> any handſome and reſpective reflexion upon Scripture. As if it were no fitter to decide controverſies in Divinity then in the Law? And do they not think that we may have more reaſon to be bold with them than they with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? if God had intended that we ſhould have been abſolutely determined in matters of faith by General Council, would he have given us ſuch a pack'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was? And yet moreover all he ſaies is beſides the mark. For this we doe not contend for that the ſcripture is the ſole Judge intended by God: for we do not ſay that it is fomally any Judge. But we ſay that the Scripture doth ſo fully and ſo plainely ſet down things neceſſary ſo fully and ſo plainely that there is no neceſſity of tradition for more matter, or of infallible Judge for more clear propoſal of things neceſſary, ſo that this which he ſaies is peccant in the ignorance of the Elench.</p>
            <p>He ſaies yet, <hi>is it not manifeſt that the Scripture may be a book as perfect as can be for the intent for which God made it?</hi> This we may take for his propoſition. Then <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as before acknowledgeth it to be our rule, againſt the Aanbaptiſts: and therfore it is a perfect rule. But elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will have it to be but our commonitory then why doth he diſpute it to be a rule againſt the Aanbaptiſts?</p>
            <p>Whereas then my adverſary would return the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to Scripture upon me, he does not or will not underſtand me, for we do not ſay, nor are bound to ſay that <hi>all neceſſary controverſies are plainly decided by Scripture alone,</hi> and, <hi>that God intended the Scripture for the plain deciſion of them:</hi> and therefore we deny his conſequences, that ſince, <hi>when it comes to the trial we are not able to ſhew any text of Scripture deciding many and moſt important controverſies, this in effect</hi> were <hi>to ſay God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed very inſufficiently what he intended to doe by Scripture.</hi> firſt we doe not ſay that all neceſſary controverſies are plainly decided by Scripture: for we ſay no controverſies
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:40740:401"/> are neceſſary in point of neceſſary faith. He puts in [neceſſary controverſies] for neceſſary truths, we ſay the Scripture plainly propoſeth all neceſſary truths: and he would bring us in ſaying, that the Scripture plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides all neceſſary contoverſies, and therefore how can he ſay that we ſay God intended the Scripture for the plain deciſion of them? 2. Therefore we deny thoſe points to be ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation which are not clearly propoſed in Scripture. 3. Whereas they ſay that the Scripture doth propoſe upon Gods intention the Church to be the infallible Judge in matters of faith, and yet cannot ſhow any text wherein this is clearly delivered, they do diſhonor God and Scripture and they diſhonor God by accuſing of Scripture; as <hi>Nilus</hi> before.</p>
            <p>In this number he holds the concluſion, that expreſſions of Scripture are obſcure in way of prophecy or type, and that there is no certain mean of direction to the ſenſe; and then that therefore there muſt be an infallible Judge. But nothing is anſwered to my anſwers about it. And did he think that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did not underſtand the manner of expreſſions of the prophets in their own language, or that <hi>David</hi> did not beare the type of Chriſt? How elſe were they ſaved in the time before Chriſt? And was the exact ſenſe of every expreſſion or type neceſſary? ſuch exceptions do not weigh. And then again, if there had been need in the time of the law of an infallible Judge for an infallible Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of dark expreſſions then; if ſo, <hi>dato non conceſſo,</hi> what is this to the neceſſity of an infallible Judge in the times of the Goſpel which is the old Teſtament revealed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N 54.</note>To paſſe by any ſlips in the former number by the ſcribe or otherwiſe, we come to this paragr. wherein he is not pleaſed to ſay any thing to what was replied about the ſeveral ſenſes of Scripture. But he would here corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate his argument with Dr. <hi>Tailer's</hi> Judgment in his diſcourſe of the liberty of prophecying. And he ſaies he thinkes me not to be ſo much eſteemed <hi>amongſt</hi> our <hi>own
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:40740:401"/> Clergy or Laity,</hi> as he. I confeſſe it <hi>Neque de me quiſquam vilius ſentit quam ipſe,</hi> as one ſaid. But though this is very true that my authority is not comparable to his, yet it was not rational for my adverſary to diminiſh me becauſe it makes a prejudice to his cauſe that ſo weak a man can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and therefore I can ſpare him in this kind. Let my adverſary be the Champion of his cauſe. And yet it may be the Reverend and learned Authour he names is not allwaies pleaſed with whatſoever he ſaid in that book. And yet alſo we can grant what is ſaid by the Doctor who does not ſay that no Arguments can be drawn from Scripture, but from thoſe Scriptures which have <hi>many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> neither doth he ſay that thoſe texts which have many ſenſes do contain points neceſſary to ſalvation, nor doth he ſay, that if they did contain points neceſſary they are not elſewhere explained by more clear texts, or may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: for ſo he ſhould diſagree from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as before.</p>
            <p>But to ſay no more, let the Doctor have the honour with all my heart of the umpirage of the controverſie in the example, which my adverſary hath put, <hi>Take for an example thoſe four words, This is my body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed ſome there are which would have five words, <hi>hoc eſt (enim) corpus meum.</hi> And alſo it may be ſaid that he may exceed in his number of interpretations of theſe words, unleſs he takes in their own many differences hereabouts in the manner and time of the converſion, they will hardly come up to two hundred divers interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And whereas he ſaies that we ſay that <hi>they are ſpoken in a figurative ſenſe and not in their natural ſenſe,</hi> we can anſwer that we do deny the literal ſenſe; and do not deny that the figurative ſenſe may be ſaid in a good ſort <hi>natural</hi> to the Sacramental uſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> there is betwixt the ſigne and the thing Signified. And much more might be ſaid herein, but let this point be compromiſed to the doctour in that excellent book which he hath lately written on purpoſe.
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:40740:402"/> He ſaies all that I can ſay and more.</p>
            <p>Here he would make good another Argument of his <hi>[the Scripture uſeth the imperative mood as well when it counſels as when it commands]</hi> He asks now, <hi>what infallible means we have to know what is recommended to us as a counſel, or as a precept to be kept under pain of damnation.</hi> We anſwer, firſt, ſuppoſing the doctrine of counſels to be right and ſound, yet are they in no great danger by the uncertainty whether ſuch a thing is propoſed by way of counſels or precept; ſince they hold it to be a thing of greater perfection to performe a counſel. Therefore if they take a thing of counſel for a thing of command there is no danger ſurely in doing more then they are ſimply commanded to. So then if this were all, it would be no ſuch difficulty as to practiſe, becauſe if they doe whatſoever is propoſed <hi>pro imperio</hi> in the imperative mood, there is no danger if it be commanded, it was neceſſary if counſelled, there is greater perfection and an accidental reward above the eſſential. God can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh which is which, though they cannot; and ſurely will if their opinion be true, reward them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And if there be any merit, it would be more meritorious to do that which is more meritorious without knowledge of it to be ſuch, becauſe then they do it more free from intention of more merit 2. If the diſtinction of a command be ſimply difficult, as to the negative, whether it be a command or not; the omiſſion of it is not, without all hope, damnative where there is general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>And now to the counſels he ſaies, in clearing this <hi>my teeth bite St.</hi> Paul, <hi>who expreſly ſuppoſeth with me that there is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of perfection above things of command.</hi> And he names the 1 <hi>Ep. to the Cor.</hi> 7.25. <hi>and</hi> 38. And then he ſaith <hi>How doth this agree with your ſtrange Divinity?</hi> We anſwer, very well with our Divinity which is not ſo ſtrange as true. Firſt they are too forward in the catching at the word
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:40740:402"/> 
               <hi>Counſel,</hi> [I give my counſel] it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. now ſurely, there is no great criticiſm in the difference betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The former is a grave and wiſe opinion or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, not a councel in the Roman ſenſe. Or if it were taken for an advice; every adviſe of the Apoſtle was not a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician counſel. For this advice he might give them not out of any command from God, but upon his private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore it doth not ground the doctrine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the obſervation of Counſels above the Law. Secondly, as it is noted, this is not delivered to all promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly as the counſels are, but to thoſe who had the gift of continency as ver. 7. which gift is not given to every one as Faith Hope and Charity, becauſe this gift of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is not neceſſary to ſalvation, in the confeſſion of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, as the other graces are, but to perfection of ſtate or ſtate of perfection. Thirdly this is not given abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for time, but with reſtriction of time, as, in the 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,, for the preſent neceſſity in the times of perſecution, and he ſaies here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I ſuppoſe: ſo that he ſpake not this by inſpiration, it ſeems. Fourthly, the matter of counſel is more difficult than that of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obedience. Yes they will ſay, for otherwiſe how ſhould they thereby ſupererogate and make the ſtate of perfection? and yet to ſerve God then in thoſe times in the married condition was more difficult, as being under more temptations for their family. Fiftly as to the 38. ver. it is not neceſſary to conſtrue <hi>well</hi> and <hi>better, de bono morali,</hi> but <hi>de bono commodo,</hi> in reſpect to thoſe times. As goodneſs is grounded in convenience, ſo it was more good, not to give in marriage, for thoſe times. And here is all that Text can afford him. As for his Syllogiſme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is no great force in it. <hi>According to you he is bound to do all that he can do: but he could do better in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her in marriage, therefore according to you was he bound not to give her under pain of damnation.</hi> Anſ. As for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, it is not any other than the propoſition of Chriſt, but
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:40740:403"/> my adverſary ſhould have put in here what he puts in the concluſion, namely [under pain of damnation] and then it might have been denied: for God accepts that which is done in ſincerity and true charity, though it be not all that we can do, let him or rhem then put thoſe words into the Major propoſition and we can then deny it: if not, there is more in the concluſion than in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Then to the minor we ſay, firſt <hi>better</hi> is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be taken abſolutely but with reſpect to thoſe ends which are ſpoken of in the Ch. and therefore is it to be underſtood, as is obſerved, not comparatively to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of commands, but comparatively to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to marriage; As <hi>Gerſon</hi> is quoted, <hi>cum conſilia dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur eſſe de meliort bono, non fit comparatio eorum ad praecepta, ſed ad ſua contraria.</hi> And let me put them a caſe upon this point, one in ſtate of virginity is ſuppoſed to abound more with luſtful deſires (which are oppoſite to internal chaſtity) then one married: Now which of theſe, think they, in this particular, more perfect, in the judgement of God: that party which doth not profeſs external cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, yet is in the mind more chaſt, or that party which doth profeſs external chaſtity and is internally leſs chaſt? what will they ſay to this? for this is <hi>caſus dabilis,</hi> they muſt ſay that the party profeſſing virginity is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but then it is not better to marry than to burn: and then they contradict St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the former ch. v. 9.</p>
            <p>Then with the former Text he confronts that of our <q>Saviour, which I produced againſt him, St. <hi>Luke</hi> the 17.10. So likewiſe when you have done all thoſe things that are commanded you, ſay we are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have done what we ought to do.</q> And here my adverſary puts in by way of diſtinction, <hi>he ſaith not, which are onely commanded by way of Counſel.</hi> And again he puts in, what <hi>we ought to do to wit by an expreſs precept ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging under damnation.</hi> And then he applies the former Text, <hi>In one ſenſe this man who hath not married his daughter
<pb n="897" facs="tcp:40740:403"/> may truly ſay I have done what I ought to do not out of ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation binding under pain of hell (for I might have done well in doing the contrary) but what I ought to do out of moſt perfect charity.</hi> Anſ. Paſſing by what we ſaid to the former Text ſimply, we ſay to it as compared with this of Chriſt, that this Text of Chriſt doth not well bear his diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the termes ſpeak altogether in contradiſtinction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to counſels: it ſpeaks of doing <hi>all that was commanded:</hi> it ſpeaks of their <hi>being unprofitable ſervants:</hi> it ſpeaks of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ought to do upon <hi>ſtrict obligation:</hi> for ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there bears due correſpondence with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and this word ſignifies a ſtrict command. Secondly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this Text with the ſcope of it in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which we have in the 7, 8, 9. <hi>verſes.</hi> And as the ſervant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Maſter in neceſſary ſervices; ſo alſo in the tenth verſe which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the creature is related to God in neceſſary ſervices of ſtrict obedience: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot here diſtinguiſh of what we ought to do, upon <hi>ſtrict obligation,</hi> and what we ought to do <hi>out of moſt perfect charity.</hi> Thirdly this diſtinction of theirs will deſtroy their doctrine of counſels: becauſe, if coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels be grounded in a duty <hi>of moſt perfect charity,</hi> then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be counſelled which is not commanded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt perfect charity is under a command. If moſt perfect charity were under a counſel, then there might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be more ſaid for counſels: but ſince moſt perfect charity is under a command, what ground is there for counſels when the root of them namely moſt perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is under a command, and expreſs precept St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul and with all thy mind. And this cannot be moulded into the notion of a counſel; for thus Chriſt anſwers to the queſtion in the ver. before, what is the great Commandement of the Law. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ver. after he ſaies, this is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Now to do thus is moſt perfect charity:
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:40740:404"/> and therefore what we can do is comprehended under all that is commanded, yea, if the law requires more then we can do (according to ordinary meaſure of grace) then we cannot do more than the law requires, now this the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and not only <hi>ſemper</hi> but <hi>ad ſemper</hi> as to the internal duty of love. And who is there in all the world that loves the Lord alwaies with all his heart, with all his ſoul, with all his mind? And therfore Gods law is not to be cut ſhort that it may be made even with our ability preſent.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the text named by him out of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> prove obedience to the law poſſible to us in the way: we may keep Gods commandements in <hi>generale,</hi> though not all as we ought: as we are ſaid to keep the way, though ſometimes we tranſgreſſe. We may keep the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as a man keeps a Caſtle againſt the enemies he keeps it till he be beat out of it, he keeps it againſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking it: but he doth not keep it ſo as not to be overcome; he keeps them as to the purpoſe of his mind; he doth not keep them abſolutly as to all acts negative in commands, negative and poſitive acts in affirmative commands. He keeps them not, as keeping contradicts all offending, for in many things we offend all, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks. And therefore can we not fulfil the law, becauſe the ſame Apoſtle ſaies 2 ch. 10. He that keeps the whole law, and offend in one ſhall be guilty of all. And therefore this argument is peccant in the ignorance of the Elench, for we can ſay that we may keep the commandements &amp; yet not fulfil them, according to the power we had in <hi>Adam,</hi> and according to the meaſure of the obligation, which is not adequated to our ſtrength now, but to Gods law as an expreſs of his holineſs, and as commenſurable to mans abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in ſtate of Original righteouſneſs. Nay it is obſervable alſo that the word in St. <hi>Iames,</hi> which is rendered ſhall offend, is as diminutive a word in the kind as I think any other, for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> leſt <hi>Hindan</hi> and the reſt of that ſort ſhould think that venial ſinnes do but caſt a little duſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="899" facs="tcp:40740:404"/> a Chriſtians life; no defilement. And therefore to conclude upon the whole matter, if the Scripture needs an infallible interpreter to diſtinguiſh betwixt counſels and precepts both given in the mood of command, this makes no difficulty until counſels find better proof. If they will take our counſel let them keep their counſel to themſelves.</p>
            <p>This we may ſay as litle to as he ſaies in it of new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.<note place="margin">N. 56.</note> He ſpeaks here again of the loſſe of Divine books. This we have ſpoken to before more then once upon his provocation. And this pincheth them: for why may not they then faile of ſome <hi>traditions</hi> and how then can we depend upon the Church, when the Church ſhould have kept them, ſince the Church, as the learned of them ſay, is to depend upon them. But own thing here he would urge, that according to us, we muſt pick out points neceſſary, <hi>one out of one Book another out of another.</hi> Anſ. Surely this is no ſtrong plea, for firſt, ought not the word of God dwel plentifully in us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks? 2. Cannot any own eaſily diſcern hiſtorical books from doctrinal? 3. Can they not take ſpecial notice of thoſe heads of doctrine or practice unto which ſalvation is expreſſely annexed. 4. This argument concludes more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily againſt them for depending upon the Church. Who can compare all their books from age to age for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin? who can compare who hath been moſt learned and moſt faithful to derive a ſucceſſional ſumme of things to be believed and to be done? nay who in the compare of Churches can preferre the beſt but by the beſt doctrin? and yet according to them we muſt take the doctrine from the Churches: who can meaſure the vaſt latitude of the univerſal Church by thoſe rules of <hi>Vincentius?</hi> is it not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to receive neceſſaries from Scripture then to boult them out of ſo many volumes of ages? And how ſhould we be ſure of keeping <hi>received traditions,</hi> when ſome traditions which were received are not yet kept by the Roman
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:40740:405"/> Church? 5. In Scripture though we pick for neceſſaries, yet we have nothing falſe: but we have falſe traditions; have we not? yea this is a falſe tradition that traditions are equal to Scripture, Yea 6. If any books be loſt they were loſt before Chriſts time; and yet thoſe which remained in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time were able to make <hi>Timothie</hi> wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And towards the reading of the Apocryphal books that ſo we may reade <hi>over the whole Canon,</hi> it is a ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſtead of proofe. The reading of them in the Church doth not inferre their canonicalneſs of proper name, and this is made good to them they know lately by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned Dr. <hi>Coſins,</hi> in a book on purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And as for accurate noting <hi>all places</hi> and conferring with <hi>other places.</hi> What then? <hi>multa non experimur quia difficilia: multa difficilia quia non experimur.</hi> Is not this poſſible? is not Salvation worth the paines? muſt every one amongſt them know the diſtinct exact ſenſe of all their definitions? no, they will ſay: but the people ſhould ſeek the law at the Prieſts mouths. Well then, ſo is it not neceſſary to Salvation that the people with us ſhould be able exactly to conferre all places: and as for thoſe places which contain neceſſaries, there is not ſuch obſcurity. And yet ſurely ſome hardneſs, according to their principles, doth belong to faith; for how otherwiſe ſhould it be ſupernatural and meritorious? therefore if their way of beliefe be ſo eaſie, it doth not beare proportion to the qualities of faith aſſigned by Mr. <hi>Knott.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Tranſlations</hi> to <hi>agree with the Originals,</hi> this we have canvaſed before. And our people can do it as well as theirs &amp; better too, becauſe they have liberty of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And to the truth of originals we muſt come in ſeveral cauſes, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> before. <hi>Omne reducitur ad principiun,</hi> is good here too. And then the conſectary of theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he would make to be negative to us; <hi>namely that God did not intend this book to be our only guide.</hi> And he would perſwade us thus. <hi>Gods wiſedome directs him to the beſt
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:40740:405"/> meanes to compaſs his intention.</hi> And then he would frame a minor with advantage thus, <hi>even our ordinary wiſedome (if we had an intention to ſet forth a writing to end all neceſſary controverſies) would direct us to ſet down plainly &amp; clearly in one place all thoſe (few as you ſay) points neceſſary to be believed.</hi> So then, this muſt be a good argument, man in ſuch a caſe, in ordinary wiſedome, would do ſo, therefore God hath done ſo. Surely theſe Romaniſts ſpeak from the top of the Capital; and will not only teach men, but God. One found fault blaſphemouſly with Gods creation, thinking and ſaying that he could have made it better. So. But the Schoolemen might have told my adverſaries that though God could have made ſeveral things in their accidentals, better: yet they could not but ſay that he could not make them in a better manner, <hi>Meliori modo.</hi> So then, alſo, if they believe that God did make the Scripture, they may believe that he could not make it in a better and more wiſe manner. Let them ſatisfie then St. <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion, who hath been his Counceller? And then the argument from man to God will binde. And yet 2. Turn the tables, and this diſcourſe is returned to them; if God had intended the Church for our infallible guide he would clearly (ſince <hi>his wiſdome directs him to the beſt means</hi> for the compaſſing of his intention) have told us ſo in one place or other; as well as man tells us plainly who is our judge in point of law, this they ſhould have demonſtrated, but no more need be ſaid of this, ſince the queſtion is <hi>de facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet another argument of this kind he hath againſt us, God hath ſet down the cermeonies in Leviticus <hi>fully, particularly and clearly: points of faith neceſſary to ſalvation import incomparably more then points of meer ceremonie. If then God had intended a book by which only he was reſolved to deliver unto us all points neceſſary to ſalvation, theſe points, as you ſay, being few, he would in ſome one part of theſe books have clearly ſet down thoſe few points a thouſand times more importing than points of ceremony.</hi> Anſ. Surely he hath
<pb n="902" facs="tcp:40740:406"/> better arguments or a bad cauſe, becauſe he in the time of the law appointed a Sanedrin as a ſtanding Aſſembly to judge all cauſes and the high prieſt too, in ſome caſe: therefore he muſt have appointed ſuch an Aſſembly now, which ſhould conſiſt of many of the laity, to judge all cauſes, and the Pope too. God is not moved by any thing to act all waies in the ſame manner. <hi>Deus vult hoc propter hoc, ſed non propter hoc vult.</hi> God orders this to this but by this is not moved. But 2. His <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> here is falſe; for he ſuppoſeth here that all the ceremonies are ſet down together in one place, otherwiſe how can he upon compare ſay, much more the ſumme of points neceſſary ſhould have been ſet down <hi>in ſome one part of theſe books,</hi> now the cerimonies are not all ſet downe together; and now and then ſome morality is mingled with them. And ſo alſo points neceſſary may be here and there mingled with other points without any diſparagement of Gods wiſedome, 3. If he hath <hi>particularly clearly and fully</hi> ſet down points of ceremonie in Scripture, then how much more points neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>a thouſand times more importing then points of ceremonie.</hi> But <hi>verum prius;</hi> for it is theirs, then the latter alſo, upon the ſame account. And ſo they may ſee how little they get by ſuch arguments. And therefore ſurely Chriſt is not obliged to his Church for credibility, but his Church to his word and ſpirit. Let <q>them think upon that of Chriſt St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the 7.17. if any one will do my will he ſhall know of my doctrin whether it be of God or whether I ſpeak of my ſelfe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And yet another <hi>proof</hi> you bring in that many hold that <hi>the Epiſtles of St. Iohn were written after the Apocalypſe</hi> &amp;c. And what then. Is it therefore true, becauſe many hold ſo? I trow not, for then rather it ſhould not be ſo, becauſe more hold the contrary, but what would he make of it, if they had been written after the <hi>Apocalypſe?</hi> this. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſuppoſition the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> are the laſt part of <q>the canon, now in this laſt part of the laſt part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>non
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:40740:406"/> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaies, I have many things to write, but I will not with inke and penne write them but, I truſt we ſhall ſee thee ſhortly and ſpeake face to face.</q> Upon this, the broken matter of his diſcourſe might for more cleareneſs be put into this forme, many things were written which are not ſet down in the canon: no man can ſay that thoſe many things were unneceſſary. Therefore no man can ſay that many things not unneceſſary are not ſet down in the canon. Anſ. We need not anſwer it. The ground of the major is rotten, and is to be made firm, if it could by him, that is not the order of the books. And it is not the order in the Latin; therefore this binds them to beleive the contrary. And therefore the minor, which muſt ſuppoſe that ſuppoſition muſt fall with it. And yet alſo how he minceth it, <hi>no man can ſay</hi> &amp;c. What is this to ſettle us in infallibility. He might alſo have ſaid better for himſelf, ſome things <hi>not unneceſſary</hi> might be amongſt thoſe which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> intended to ſpeak to them; and this would have ſerved his turne againſt us. But let them ſpeak and prove categorically that the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were written after the Apocalypſe, and that <hi>many things</hi> which he would ſpeak unto them were neceſſary. Otherwiſe <hi>no man can ſay</hi> that this argumentation concludes ought. And beſides the terms <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> might have a diſtinction, if it ſounds as uſeful it is not to the point of the queſtion: if as much as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: yet what he ſhould ſpeak to them, he ſhould ſpeak by the ſpirit of God, and let them give us ſuch aſſurance for what they would adde to Scripture: then they will ſay ſomewhat. And yet again they ſhould not ſurely be neceſſary, becauſe <hi>many:</hi> for ſurely ſome things which were neceſſary were written; and yet thoſe things which are certain are few, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid, <hi>Certa ſunt in paucis.</hi> Again ſhould thoſe <hi>many things</hi> have been adverſe to what he had written or diverſe, or the ſame in ſubſtance? not adverſe they will ſay, becauſe they ſay their traditions are <hi>praeter Evangelium,</hi> not <hi>contra,</hi> beſide the Goſpel, not
<pb n="904" facs="tcp:40740:407"/> contrary: if diverſe, then ſurely they did not contein things in ſubſtance neceſſary. For would Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> have written ſeveral things not neceſſary, and have left to word of mouth things neceſſary when <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> vaunted ſo much of their Apoſtolical traditions. And if they were the ſame in ſubſtance, then what addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Again if they were neceſſary how can this be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the 20.31. whereupon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> it ſeems, do conclude that there was enough written which was ſufficient to faith: my third anſwer about this argument, that humane judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories have their uſe without infalliblity, he toucheth not.</p>
            <p>My fourth he toucheth in the next paragr.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Par. 57.</note>In this number he ſeems, if I may think ſo to be a litle hooked, and with more line to be more ſnarled. There muſt ſtick upon the Church Roman a cenſure either of fallibility or unfaithfulneſs. Thus it is, they ſay the Scripture is not our guide ſufficiently becauſe it doth not decide controverſies, we return it to them, that upon the ſame account the Church Roman is not, becauſe it doth not decide whatſoever is neceſſary to be believed, by a full Catholique in their ſenſe. And for inſtance; whether the <hi>Pope</hi> hath a temporal power or not? if temporal, whether directly as the Canoniſts, or <hi>propter bonum ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituale,</hi> as others: then whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be ſuperiour to a Council in things Eccleſiaſtical. To theſe he gives me no poſitive account: and yet are theſe points <hi>Cardines mundi &amp; eccleſiae;</hi> the main points upon which the Church and world with them muſt turne. Do they tell us that it is a neceſſary point know whether the king be head of the Church; and is it not as neceſſary for them to know whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be head of the Church? But we muſt conſider his apology. <hi>Our doctrine is that the Church can decide any point formerly revealed, when any neceſſity ſhall require it, or the declaration of this point concerne ſalvation.</hi> Anſ. what worke would ſome adverſary have made
<pb n="905" facs="tcp:40740:407"/> him for ſuch a return? The charge againſt Scripture was that it cannot end all neceſſary controverſies. I recriminate, neither doth their Church. They reply, the Church can. I reioyn, firſt, here they vary. I ſaid their Church, they ſay, the Church; as if they would not own the Church of Rome in its catholickneſs. 2. They ſay it can. But if it can and will not, I am yet to ſeek for my truſt. and as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Pelagians</hi> about the poſſibility of the law, how ſhall we think that poſſible which was never done? if it cannot, how is it infallible in all points? if it will not, how is it faithfull? if it can, let it do ſo: and then let them object our differences to us, and the inability of Scripture to end them. 3. He ſaies the Church can decide any point <hi>formerly revealed,</hi> what meanes he by this? if formerly revealed, then what need of a judge for it? and then the moſt they can do is to declare; and ſo may another Church and that not neceſſary neither, if it were formerly revealed. Well then. Are theſe points revealed or not? if they be not revealed, then by their own confeſſion, they cannot decide them. And if they be formerly revealed, what need to be decided but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but 4. <hi>When any neceſſity ſhall require</hi> &amp;c. But let me know why, when ſuch a thing is propoſed by the Church it is a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and a neceſſary point to be believed, and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is neceſſary to be believed and yet not decided by the Church. As for inſtance, it is neceſſary to be believed that the <hi>Pope</hi> is head of the Church: for ſo <hi>Bellarmin</hi> defines a Chriſtian with ſubjection to the <hi>Pope</hi> as head of the Church, in his Catechiſm. And yet it ſeemes this is not decided by the Church; becauſe then it is decided whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be ſupreme in Eccleſiaſticals. So then the definition of the Church cannot be the adaequate reaſon of our faith, becauſe ſomewhat is neceſſary to be believed which is not decided; and yet again, if ſomewhat be neceſſary to be believed, then by my adverſaries confeſſion, it ought to be declared, becauſe it doth <hi>concern our ſalvation.</hi> And
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:40740:408"/> ſince the Church is to act not <hi>ex arbitrio,</hi> but <hi>ex officio,</hi> how can it elſe clear it ſelf of the bloud of all men, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth Acts 20.27. when it doth not declare <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the whole counſel of God. And if they take [counſel] here in their ſenſe; we can make uſe of it to them thus, that if he declared all counſels then much more neceſſary doctrine, becauſe counſels, according to them, are not ſimply neceſſary, but yet it cannot be taken in their ſenſe, becauſe he diſchargeth himſelfe hereby of the bloud of all men? and therefore muſt it be meant of what was neceſſary to their ſalvation ſimply; as counſels, they ſay are not.</p>
            <p>So then he thinks it the beſt way to pitch upon the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and to ſay, <hi>Salvation hath very ſecurely been had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deciſion of theſe points you ſpeak of. If Circumſtances happen that ſalvation cannot be had without their deciſion, they will then be decided.</hi> Anſ. firſt then, let there be a defal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and diſcounting of one point from the number of thoſe which are accounted by them to us neceſſary, which the Scripture hath not decided, and that is whether the <hi>King</hi> be head of the Church, for ſurely there is as much reaſon of neceſſity to ſalvation for them to know whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be head of the Church, as for us to know whether the <hi>King</hi> be head; and more too ſince infallibility is annexed to their head. 2. If Salvation may be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an aſſurance in thoſe points, then how ſhall we be bound to the <hi>Trent</hi> Council in beliefe of the Roman Church to be the Apoſtolick Church, without which no ſalvation, when yet we need not know who is ſupreme in that Church? Take it in this forme, ſubjection to the univerſal Church is neceſſary to ſalvation, the Roman Church is not univerſal unles he be head, therefore unles he be head of the Church, ſubjection to the Roman Church is not neceſſary to ſalvation. And then <hi>Conclamatum eſt.</hi> And if <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> according to him, can bring theſe points under a neceſſity of deciſion, then it ſeems they are but indifferent <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> for circumſtances are only conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="907" facs="tcp:40740:408"/> in caſe of indifferency. And then by the virtue of the former diſcourſe, it is indifferent to ſalvation whether we be ſubject to the Roman Church or not. And ſo might we end the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But he goes on, <hi>if you acknowledge a reall neceſſity to be at all times of the infallible knowledge of theſe points.</hi> Anſ. He doth not take notice that I diſpute with him upon his own principles, by which he he is bound to ſhew that the Church hath defined theſe points; ſince he ſaies the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not decided all neceſſary points: but hath referred us to the Church for their deciſion. Now then ſince theſe points are not neceſſary to us, but to them who have that opinion of the Roman Church, it belongs to them to ſhew the Church's deciſion of theſe points. And therefore if <hi>they believe all Scripture,</hi> and therefore theſe, (if they be determined there) this will not ſerve them, though it is enough for us; becauſe what the Scripture doth not clearly define, they ſay the Church by Scripture is deputed to. And if the Church hath not done it, though they know the way to <hi>Rome,</hi> they do not know the way to heaven, and ſo all his <hi>arguments fall of themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which he ſaies he addes that <hi>our whole Church teacheth the definitions of Councils confirmed to be infallible,</hi> how little hath it in it: their <hi>whole Church</hi> if they take it for the univerſal Church, it is but a part, either in quantity or dominion. If they mean it not as the univerſal Church, then we may ſay as well our whole Church teacheth that they are not infallible, nay nor did the former Councils themſelves account themſelves infallible. But 2. [Councils confirmed] by whom confirmed? why do they not here ſpeak out? for in other places, where this is not actually conteſted, they will ſay that they are to be confirmed by the <hi>Pope.</hi> But why then are they ſo loath to end the controverſie upon which ſide the ſuperiority ſhould be caſt upon the council or upon the <hi>Pope?</hi> for if the councils are to be confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> then they have their <hi>eſſe
<pb n="908" facs="tcp:40740:409"/> Conſtitutivum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> from him, and then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he muſt have the ſuperiority; notwithſtanding what the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> determined. But I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that no <hi>Circumſtances</hi> will ever be ſufficient to give occaſion to this deciſion. All points are to be decided by <hi>Councils confirmed,</hi> now the councils will never vote the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor the <hi>Pope</hi> confirm the ſuperiority of the Council. Therefore it will never be decided. Let them therefore <hi>ſubmit</hi> to Scripture, which their <hi>Church obligeth</hi> them <hi>to believe.</hi> And let them hereafter think better of the Scriptures ſufficiency, ſince in ſuch points the Church Roman cannot or will not or dare not ſupply its ſuppoſed defects. And they ſhall <hi>find it not to leave them ignorant of what is neceſſary for them to know: to cavill at it,</hi> they <hi>will pretend that to be neceſſary which</hi> they <hi>will ſay the next moment not to be</hi> neceſſary. They call for a deciſion by Scripture of the queſtion whether a King be head of the Church, as of a neceſſary point, and now they deny the queſtion to be neceſſary of the <hi>Pope.</hi>

               <note place="margin">N. 58.</note>Herein he would reinforce his argument to prove us contrary to Scripture in not receiving extreme unction, as a Sacrament upon the command of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> 5.13, 14, 15. ver. firſt he declaimes upon our deniall of their interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And then would urge it upon compare of the claritude of this next for them with the clearenes of other texts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for us. Let them anſwer our texts as we anſwer theirs, and not only ſay that one is as clear as the other.</p>
            <p>Well, but he ſaies now, <hi>How clear this place is, appears by the very letter, in which we have all we can deſire to make a Sacrament; a viſible ſigne of an inviſible grace.</hi> Anſ. every Sacrament of proper name is a viſible ſigne of an inviſible grace: but every viſible ſigne of an inviſible grace is not a Sacrament of proper name, unles it hath Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And therefore muſt we referre it to the uſe of healing, ſpoken of St. <hi>Marke</hi> the 6, 13, which it
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:40740:409"/> ſeems, continued ſome time, 1 <hi>Ep. Cor.</hi> 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>9. And "30, <hi>gifts of healing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet he ſuppoſeth that the Scripture hath decided this point for them. Hereupon, we came upon him, <q>if, the Scripture hath decided this point,</q> then the Scripture can judge and end controverſies. To this he replies by asking, whether it therefore follows that it <hi>can end all neceſſary controverſies, becauſe it can end this one controverſie.</hi> We reioyne, that it doth not follow <hi>ex vi formae,</hi> that becauſe it can do one, it can do all. But yet it may follow <hi>ex vi materiae,</hi> thus; if it can decide this which is a neceſſary matter, why not all ſuch? ſince eſpecially they confeſs this Sacrament is not ſo neceſſary, as ſome other, becauſe it is but a caſuall Sacrament. And the Sacrament of penance may ſupply the uſe of it. But 2. The uſe which we make of his former conceſſion as it ſeems, that the Scripture had decided this point, is in order to the act more then the object. For hereby we ſee that the Scripture can decide a point, which by them is wont to be allowed onely to a living judge: now it is true <hi>ex parte actus,</hi> if it can decide one, it can decide another; for the cheif incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Scriptures not deciding controverſies is urged in reference to the act: and therefore a living judge is by them ſubſtituted for this capacity.</p>
            <p>But he ſaies, <hi>again is this controverſie by this text ended? do you not ſtill ſtand out in the contrary opinion.</hi> Anſ. This doth not hinder the controverſie to be ended, becauſe we are not convinced. It is poſſible for them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſome points which they will not profeſs. It is poſſible for ſome points to be clear, which they are not convinced of; conviction therefore is not the meaſure of deciſion. For by this argument the <hi>Trent</hi> Council had with us and the French ended no controverſies: becauſe we are not convinced thereby. And therefore we are not to be guided by them, becauſe they cannot end our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. And if they ſay the Council is furniſhed with
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:40740:410"/> ſufficient aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, which may be apt to convince: ſurely we can ſay that the Scripture is more apt to convince, becauſe there is no queſtion made of its being written by inſpiration. So then we cannot ſay, that the point of extreme unction is not decided, becauſe we are not convinced: but we can ſay that we are not convinced, becauſe it is not decided. But alſo we muſt note to them from hence that it ſeems we muſt be perſwaded in matters of beliefe by the Holy Ghoſt, ſince texts which they ſuppoſe ſo clear, do not convince. Moreover he ſaies, <hi>your ſecond anſwer is flatly againſt the Text, for you ſay thoſe words do onely relate to the gift of healing in thoſe daies; and the Scripture ſaith they have alſo a relation to the healing of the ſoul.</hi> "If he hath committed ſinnes they ſhall be forgiven him. Anſ. <hi>Qui ad pauca reſpicit de facili pronunciat.</hi> He doth not take notice that the healing of the ſoul hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>prayer of Faith;</hi> unleſs <hi>Eſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> can indeed prove that the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> is the forme of the Sacrament. Secondly, whereas he blames me for refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this to the gift of healing, let him retract that blame for the Council of <hi>Trents</hi> ſake; which in the 14 ſeſſion, for want likely of other Texts to prove Chriſt's inſtitution of this Sacrament, will have it inſinuated by St. <hi>Mark;</hi> which ſurely can be onely in the 6. ch. where it refers to the gift of healing. And there they may ſee that the Elders did cure by anointing with oyle: which he demands a Text for. And they did it <hi>commonly</hi> in reſpect of frequency, though not commonly, <hi>quod modum effectus.</hi> Therefore may we ſee by this, that the <hi>Trent</hi> Council could erre (and if that, other Councils, they may think) in its peremptory determination of this point, <hi>Si quis dixerit extremam unctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem non eſſe vere &amp; proprie ſacramentum, &amp; a beato Iacolo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolo promulgatum; ſed ritum tantum acceptum a patribus, aut figmentum humanum, Anathema ſit.</hi> If any one ſhall ſay that extreme unction is not truly and properly a Sacrament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged by the bleſſed Apoſtle St. <hi>Iames,</hi> but a rite taken

Only <hi>Origen</hi> made myſteries of the Church, as the word is taken largely: theſe make Sacraments, as the word is taken ſtrictly. And ſurely they are hard put to it to attribute what there to the Sacrament, which is atttributed to prayer, which is therefore ſo much Commended by the Apoſtle in the following verſes.</p>
            <p>To take notice here of that which is new,<note place="margin">N. 59.</note> He here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts the clearneſs of that Text [this is my body] with the clearneſs of thoſe Texts I produced for the Sunday and Baptiſm of Infants.</p>
            <p>He ſaies, <hi>they are words expreſſed by four ſeveral wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Scripture without any intimation of their being ſpoken figuratively.</hi> Anſ. We have produced ſome Texts for the obſervation of the Lords day and for Baptiſm of Infants, without any figure: therefore our Texts may, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be as clear. Secondly, If the ſenſe of this Text be ſo clear, why did not the Ages of the Church urge it before the Lateran Councill? were they all alſo blind? as they muſt be, if the Text was ſo clear in their ſenſe. And Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If the Text ſo clear of it ſelf, what need to conferr it with the ſixth of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and if they would conferr Texts they might find more againſt them in the points of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But what will they ſay if the ſixth of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks not of Sacramental eating? For if ſo, how can the 53. ver. be underſtood: for then Infants (unleſs they are to have the Communion, as antiently) and the Thief upon the Croſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="912" facs="tcp:40740:411"/> more of this perſwaſion; as <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and <hi>Cuſan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore let them conſider what hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon this point, and then let them referre the iſſue to a compare betwixt the clearneſs of texts for them in points of difference, and of texts for us as to things neceſſary. for this ſhould have been the ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>The contradiction he makes by the ſhift is not yet well anſwered. He ſaid in the former paper that the words are clear in this Sacrament: and yet alſo that the Scripture <q>doth not decide this point. Upon this I ſaid, how farre is this from a contradiction.</q> He ſaies now, that <hi>this doth ariſe out of my ſpeaking according to your principles.</hi> Anſ. He was much miſtaken, if he thought I could be thus deceived with a ſuppoſal, of his own conſequence for one of my principles. He would cavill thus, this text which he brings is more clear for him then thoſe I bring are clear for me. Then if my texts leſs clear for me do prove my points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe texts more clear for him do prove his texts. But we ſay the texts he brings are not ſo clear for him as they are clear againſt him: and therefore how can he proceed upon our principles.</p>
            <p>And yet again he ſaies, <hi>and again you ſay on the other ſide by theſe our texts (clearer then yours) this controverſie is not clearly decided, therefore I muſt conſequently ſay that according to you this controverſie the Scripture doth not decide.</hi> Anſ. Some are blamed for charging upon opinions remote conſequences but he chargeth me with a conſequence of his opinion that becauſe he thinks his texts more clear for him then mine for me, I muſt needs alſo ſay ſo, to free him from inconvenience; ſurely we can hold our principles better then he would make them. And yet once more he will play the Sophiſter <hi>it is according to your principles that theſe texts muſt
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:40740:411"/> be clear becauſe they be clearer then thoſe which you are forced to affirm clear. And again you muſt ſay that they are not clear for fear you ſhould confeſs them to decide againſt you.</hi> Anſ. This harpes upon the ſame ſtring, he ſuppoſeth me a Captive to his conſequences upon his own opinion. My principle is good, that points neceſſary are clearly ſet down in Scripture: but his aſſumption is not right that his texts are more clear then mine. this I demand the proof of. If I were bound by my principles or his diſcourſe to confeſs that his texts were clearer then mine; he would ſay ſomewhat: but <hi>falſum prius.</hi> And yet this is fairely returnable to him, he is bound by the condition of their principles to ſay that their texts are clear for him (and yet they are not ſo clear for him as they are againſt him) becauſe they have neither reaſon nor Antiquity for their ſenſe: and yet muſt ſay again that the text hath not decided this point, for feare it ſhould be able to decide controverſies.</p>
            <p>And now he draws up again, <hi>now if theſe two places be denied to be clear with clarity ſufficient to put an end to the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, then according to my principles, ſcarce any controverſie will be decided by any text.</hi> Anſ. He hath ſeen the reaſons why thoſe texts muſt be denied to bear his ſenſe and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath as well cleared my texts for things neceſſary to be conteined plainly in Scripture, let thoſe judge, whoſe intereſs it is not, to be Judges. To ſuch I ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 2. He doth very ill to argue from his conceit to an impoſſibility in the thing; as if, if theſe texts did not clearly ſpeak this his ſenſe, no controverſie could be determined by any text. <hi>A non eſſe ad non poſſe non valet.</hi> He might have known that the Nicene Fathers determined the Coeſſentiality of the Son of God by Scripture and that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> concludes againſt the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> by Scripture. And that the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, I hope, concluded extreme unction by Scripture: ſo that it lay in Scripture clearly determined, as in <hi>actu ſignato:</hi> the Council did but call it out and ſhew it to the people.
<pb n="914" facs="tcp:40740:412"/> 3. He ſhould have ſaid [<hi>according</hi> to his purpoſe] <hi>ſcarſe any controverſie can then be determined by Scripture:</hi> for ſpeculative principles may yeild more then ingagements. Perſons will ever plead diſſatisfaction, though the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within be convinced. And 3. Others of his religion are not in this of his perſwaſion: for they will not ſo lightly give over the determinability of other points by Scripture. And yet I commend alſo his modeſty in that he ſaies not abſolutely no controverſie, but <hi>ſcarſe any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</hi> So that it is not repugnant to a controverſie <hi>Ex natura rei</hi> to be determined by Scripture. And then there is no ſuch neceſſity of a living Judge, ſurely the living Judge is more neceſſary for the ſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> than for our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Then he takes exceptions at my diſcourſe about the nature of a ſacrament. He tells me, <hi>you do not do it as you ſhould have been done to the preſent purpoſe; to wit by alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more clear texts to prove that Chriſts true body is not really in the Sacrament, then I alleadge to prove that it was really in it.</hi> Anſ. But firſt they may thinke that we do underſtand our ſelves ſufficiently in this caſe, not to be bound to give any texts for the negative. And therefore ſince they affirme they ſhould prove ſo ſtrongly that nothing can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: and ſince they challenge, they ſhould make clear work as they goe; we ſufficiently diſcharge our parts in the taking away their arguments, which concludes to us and might to them the negative, and ſince the ſignal texts for their cauſe in this point, are anſwered we have no more to do. 2. Such a demand will return upon him; I have reaſon to doubt of his Interpretation of the text of St. <hi>Iames</hi> lately agitated. I ſay alſo, give me a clearer text againſt my ſenſe which I make of it, namely as relating to the gift of healing. Is not this as equall a demand, ſince eſpecially the council could not, it ſeems, fetch their ſenſe from tradition? 3. If Chriſt's being really in the Sacrament would ſatisfie them without determination of
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:40740:412"/> the manner, this controverſie would be at an end: for we ſay as antiently, <hi>Praeſentiam agnoſcimus, modum neſcimus,</hi> but, forſooth, they muſt appoint the manner of preſence, and yet cannot agree about the manner of converſion of the Element into the body. 4. What need of any texts againſt their ſenſe, when the ſenſe imports that which cannot be? although the Canoniſts do flatter the <hi>Pope</hi> with all kind of power: yet one ſaid well of him, <hi>Papa non poteſt facere de quadrato rotundum.</hi> Nay, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins handſomely concerning thoſe things which are in queſtion whether God can do, it ſhould rather be ſaid that they cannot be done, then that God cannot do them. So this cannot be. For it implies a contradiction, yea many, as it is noted. It implies the body not to be when it is. If the body be to be made then it is not: for the terme of motion cannot be exiſtent before the motion be accompliſhed. So then it is, namely in Heaven: and yet muſt not be, becauſe it is to be made on Earth by the Prieſt. And yet fiftly. If he would not make an ill uſe of a courteſie, we might gratifie this humor a little; and tell him that there is a Text in the 1 Ep. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. which concludes clearly againſt his ſenſe, for it is ſaid, "you ſhew the Lords death till he come. If it be done in remembrance, how is he corporally preſent? And now me thinks then they ſhould be obliged to anſwer my Texts for my ſenſe againſt their ſenſe: ſince indeed their ſenſe is non-ſence.</p>
            <p>Here he comes over again (to make the work more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) with ſome paſſages of the Athanaſian Creed,<note place="margin">N. 60.</note> which he thinks every one is bound explicitly to believe (though they think an implicit faith ſufficient to them) and yet they are not clearly ſet down in Scripture, To this I anſwered that the matter of them in the generality is found accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to equivalence in Scripture although it be not found in terms. Only they are deſired to conſider that this anſwer was made to the other paſſages of the Athanaſian Creed,
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:40740:413"/> and not to the conſubſtantiality of the Son of God: for this is more expreſly ſpoken of as I have told them; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not be urged to a neceſſity of anſwering what I ſaid diſtinctly about this point, he includes it amongſt other paſſages of the Creed: it may be upon theſe accounts: that it might ſeem to be under no more neceſſity of actual belief than the other; and Secondly, might loſe the uſe of a proper anſwer, and he might have leſs to do by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering it in common, but we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
            <p>My anſwer therefore to the properties of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the H. Trinity is yet in full vigour and force, that the matter of them is as well found in Scripture, (though not in termes, yet according to equivalence) as their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>To this he ſaies now, <hi>To be as clearely ſet down as Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, in Scripture, is (according to your own principles) not to be clearly ſet down at all.</hi> Anſ. Again he playes the Sophiſter in taking that to be ſpoken <hi>ad rem,</hi> which was ſpoken <hi>ad hominem.</hi> Therefore cannot be conclude that there is an equall independency of both on Scripture to be inferred from my words. They hold tranſubſtantiation ſo upon Scripture; I not. But I make uſe of their diſtinction, as to this point, againſt them, for thoſe paſſages in the Athanaſian Creed.</p>
            <p>Neither is it any boot for him to ſay, <hi>It is not more ſatisfactorie, if you mean to argue out of our own principles; for according to us, all points neceſſary, (and this point in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) are not clearly ſet down in Scripture, and to prove this I have laboured all the Chap.</hi> So then, thus we know <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> They will make the beſt proof of their points they can by Scripture: but they make a better uſe of Scriptures by their obſcurity; that ſo cauſes might neceſſarily fall into the hands of the Romans. Firſt then, this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> we have by them, that they dare not ſtand to Scripture for the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their points, and they may know who thoſe were which were <hi>Lucifugae Scripturarum.</hi> Therefore I hope, we
<pb n="917" facs="tcp:40740:413"/> ſhall have leave to make the ſhorter work by abatement of diſcourſe out of Scripture. For when you produce Scripture for your cauſe, we can retort your own confeſſion, this point is not clear in Scripture. Having then beaten them out of the hold of the Fathers, &amp; now out of the hold of the Scriptures, we may have done enough. But ſecondly, to give them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more chaſe, though they will not make Scripture a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; yet ſince they will make it a proof for their auctora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we can ſay as well as they can prove this point by Scriptures; ſo is the Athanaſian Creed as provable by Scripture, as to thoſe paſſages about the properties of the divine perſons. And now might I name <hi>Boucher,</hi> who in his <hi>Mir veilles de Deiu,</hi> hath the ſame diſtinction in the point of tranſubſtantiation, that though it be not found in Scripture in the term, yet according to equivalence. But what ſaith <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his 3. b. <hi>de ſacr. Euch. cap.</hi> 23. <hi>Etiamſi Scriptura quam ſupra adduximus videatur nobis tam clara ut poſſit coge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re hominem, non protervum, tamen an ita fit, merito dubitari po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</hi> So then the Scripture ſeems to him to be in this point ſo clear that it might compel a man not pertinacious. Yet he muſt needs ſpill the milk he gives, leſt we ſhould come no more to the Roman Cow. But if a Scripture may be ſo clear to them in a point of controverſie: why not to us, in points neceſſary? Yea the <hi>Trent</hi> Counſel goes further in their 13 Seſs. They ſay the words do carry before them that proper and moſt open ſignification, <hi>propiam illam &amp; apertiſſimam ſignificationem prae ſe ferunt.</hi> And I hope they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a plain and moſt open ſignification did they not? if they did not, then here is a falſity to the Councils Declaration, if they did; ſo may Scripture have a plain and moſt open ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in points of faith. Again if the Sacrament of extreme unction was determined by the <hi>Trent</hi> Counſel with reſpect to Scripture, as before, why ſhould we not ſtand to Scripture in other points?</p>
            <p>And this may be ſufficient out of their own principles. And as for our own principles, as to the queſtion about the
<pb n="918" facs="tcp:40740:414"/> properties of the Divine Perſons, we need not labour therein. For if we hold that all things neceſſary are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in Scripture: then it is conſequent hereunto, that the truth of thoſe properties is no more neceſſary to be believed than according to what clearneſs they are delivered in by Scripture. And then Secondly, to anſwer to the point it ſelf, thoſe oppoſite relations, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, whereby the H. perſons are diſtinguiſhed in their perſonalities, do connotate themſelves ſufficiently. For the Father being the firſt Perſon, muſt be of himſelf; the Son, as ſuch, muſt be begotten. The H. Ghoſt, ſince there is but one only Son, as is plain in Scripture, muſt not be begotten: but proceeds; which is the expreſſion of Scrip-there. Indeed there is a queſtion whether the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son. But as to this we need not conſult the antient reading of the Athanaſian Creed; if the Mr. of the ſentences may be believed, who thinks there is not ſo vaſt a difference, as that either part did deſtroy ſalvation. And if it be abſolutely neceſſary to believe as the Roman Church in this point, why could not Pope <hi>Urban</hi> ſee the truth hereof in the diſpute with the Greeks about it, as well as our Anſelm? Why did he bring him into the Liſts with this Preface, <hi>Includamus hunc in orbe noſtro tanquam alterius orbis papam?</hi> And ſurely it ſeems to be as poſſible for the unlearned people to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without a poſitive faith herein, as it was for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Greeks in a poſitive difference: unleſs our adverſaries will damn them all who hold not with them herein. He goes on, <hi>your ſecond anſwer is deſtroyed by the former.</hi> Anſw. Yes ſurely if our adverſaries are to be our judges, we need not <hi>hold</hi> our <hi>articles</hi> which we hold neceſſary, <hi>upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church,</hi> but upon clear Texts; and clearer Texts too, than they have for their tranſubſtantiation or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church.</p>
            <p>But to the main matter of my anſwer he makes no return. <q>I ſaid, although we believe what is ſaid in
<pb n="919" facs="tcp:40740:414"/> 
                  <hi>(Athanaſius)</hi> his creed, yet therefore we are not bound to believe it upon the Authority of the Church, ſince he would have believed it though the Church had not; as he did ſometimes differ from the common profeſſion of the Church in the conſubſtantiality of the ſonne of God.</q> And what ſaies he to this? nothing. And beſides the Authority of the Church hath not it ſelfe equally to the paſſages in the Creed and to tranſubſtantiation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaid that this tranſubſtantiation was no <hi>dogma fidei</hi> before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaies in his 3. <hi>b. de ſacram. Euch.</hi> 23. <hi>ch.</hi> For as for the conſent of the Fathers (which he ſaies he did non read) ſurely <hi>Scotus</hi> did very well know what it was; ſince the conſent of the Fathers is by the Schoolemen laid for the foundation of ſchool-Divinity. It remaineth therefore that both my anſwers may be good according to both principles.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance of things neceſſary not clearly taught by Scripture, he does here re-urge,<note place="margin">N. 61.</note> namely Baptiſm of Infants. And here he names my anſwer, that <hi>it is not neceſſary for the Salvation of the Children to be baptized.</hi> But here I diſtinguiſhed of a neceſſity of praecept and a neceſſity of mean, the former we granted: the latter we denied, "ſo as that if it be not baptized, it is undoubtedly damned. Theſe words do make my ſenſe to be underſtood againſt an abſolute neceſſity, without which no poſſibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To prove this, I brought the Text St. <hi>Marke</hi> the 16.6. <q>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved: but he that believeteh not ſhall be damned.</q> now, this Text, he ſaith, <hi>ſpeaketh nothing of Children.</hi> And this gloſs he gives upon the latter part of that Text <hi>He that believeth not, and conſequently would poſitively not be baptized ſhall be damned.</hi> Anſ. He trifles. I acknowledge that the Text ſpeaks not of Infants: for the drift of my diſcourſe upon this Text was otherwiſe, namely upon the caſe of thoſe of age. And my argument did runne upon advantage, thus; if the H. Gh. Did not reduplicate damnation upon defect
<pb n="920" facs="tcp:40740:415"/> of baptiſm to thoſe of age, then much leſs reaſon is there to exclude Infants from Salvation, who may have baptiſm in <hi>re</hi> but in <hi>voto</hi> not, as they ſpeak. This was the effect of my diſcourſe let the point come to the pinch. Though they do believe yet ſhould they have the ſeale of faith: but if they do not believe, damnation here proceeds not upon defect of baptiſm, but upon defect of faith, which if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had conſidered, he would not have annexed Salvation imediately to baptiſm in his 2. <hi>b. de ef. ſacr. c.</hi> 3. And not to faith but as a diſpoſition to baptiſm. 2. All poſitive refuſal of baptiſm makes a defect of baptiſm: but all defect of baptiſm doth not make even in thoſe of age a refuſal thereof. Now it is <hi>caſus dabilis,</hi> that one of age may believe, and yet may not have baptiſm, as the neceſſity may fall out. Shall this man be damned though he hath faith, becauſe he hath not baptiſm, which he could not have? and this was the caſe which the Martyr that on a ſuddain, when one of the forty ſhrunke, ſtepped in and made up the number, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> relates it, he believed and was not Baptized. What was he damned? no, they will ſay he had baptiſm in <hi>voto,</hi> and the baptiſm of bloud. Well, but if there were an abſolute neceſſity of baptiſm as there is of faith he muſt have been damned notwithſtanding, abſolute neceſſity knowes no diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>But therefore he produceth a Text for abſolute neceſſity, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the 3.5. <q>Except a man be borne of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q> Anſ. If we compare this verſe with the third, we need not make any other conſtruction then of a neceſſity of being born from above. Neither is it likely that Chriſt would have ſpoken no otherwiſe to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of baptiſm, had he meant it ſo. And <hi>Ferus,</hi> though he ſpeaks of this ſenſe <hi>ad literam;</hi> yet hath he other ſenſes thereof. And if it be compared with the other Text St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 3.11. you ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire;
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:40740:415"/> as that Text is to be underſtood by an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo may this alſo, notwithſtanding the order of the words. But 2. <hi>Dato, non conceſſo,</hi> that it is to be underſtood of Baptiſmal water, yet the Rhemiſts upon the place do confeſs that in two caſes Baptiſmal water is not neceſſary. Namely in the caſe of martyrdome; and if they have a deſire of it, but are prevented neceſſarily by death. And the reaſon thereof is ſufficient, <hi>becauſe God hath not bound his grace in reſpect of his own freedome, to the Sacraments.</hi> and ſo <hi>Ferus</hi> upon the place, <hi>Deus enim non alligavit potentiam ſuam Sacramentis</hi> &amp;c. God hath not tied his own power to the Sacraments. By his ordinate will indeed he gives grace by the Sacraments: But nevertheles he can give it without the Sacrament. Let them then tell me why Infants may not have <hi>rem Sacramenti,</hi> without the ſeale: as if God ſhould have no favour for Infants, becauſe they cannot be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the priviledge. Let then the Rhemiſts and <hi>Ferus</hi> be compurgators for the <hi>pernicious doctrine</hi> of mine as he calls it. And now whatſoever teſtimony he produceth of the neceſſity of baptiſm; (unles St. <hi>Auſtin's,</hi> as to Infants) they will ſtand very well with my termes in their ordinary ſenſe; which doth not contradict an ordinary neceſſity of it to Infants: but again that all the Fathers were of this opinion I can deny. I except <hi>Tertullian.</hi> And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for thoſe of age, holdes but an ordinary neceſſity; as appears in his 4. <hi>b. De Bapt. Contra Donat.</hi> 23. <hi>ch.</hi> This ordinary neceſſity I ſtand for. He himſelf intends no more by his teſtimonies, Dr. <hi>Tayler's</hi> and others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he abſolves me himſelf: but I cannot abſolve him from ignorance in the Elench. This doth not contradict me, who do diſpute now againſt an abſolute neceſſity: which he muſt maintain; or elſe in this he comes ſhort of his deſign. And alſo that that allowance of baptiſm of Infants (after it be done) doth not inferre an abſolute neceſſity of their being damned (in the judgment of the Fathers) if they were not Baptized; if they will take Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> opinion
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:40740:416"/> for all, let them conſult him in his 5. b. 33. p. where he ſaith <q>I know there are many ſentences found in the books and writings of the antient Fathers to prove both Eccleſſiaſtical and Moral defects in the Miniſters of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm a bar to the heavenly benefit thereof.</q> Now in <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> I trow, there are Eccleſiaſtical defects: for there is a defect in not being Eccleſiaſtical. And therefore whether others miſtake the Fathers, either in the point of fact, or in the reaſon of that allowance, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But he gives me a Syllogiſm, which we will not neglect, becauſe it is very rare with him. He diſputes upon my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of neceſſity, thus; <hi>This precept is neceſſarily to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, this precept is not plainly ſet down in Scripture: therefore all neceſſary points are not plainly ſet down in Scripture.</hi> This hath the face but not the form of a Syllogiſm. But to paſs that, we anſwer therefore that this Syllogiſm doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude contradictorily to the ſtate of the queſtion, which is whether all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture. Now all that is neceſſary to be done is larger then all that is neceſſary to be done unto Salvation. Though all things neceſſary to be done unto Salvation, are neceſſary to be done: yet all that is neceſſary to be done, is not neceſſary to be done unto Salvation. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate medii:</hi> the latter <hi>neceſſitate praecepti.</hi> Now the knowledg of the former is ſimply neceſſary: the knowledg of the latter is not ſo neceſſary. Whatſoever is known to be praecepted is to be neceſſarily done: but whatſoever is praecepted, is not neceſſary to be known. So that alſo his Syllogiſm was peccant in the fallacie of the conſequent.</p>
            <p>He followes me then, your <hi>Anſwer will not helpe you out here, whatſoever is neceſſarily inferred from the Scriptures is binding in the vertue of the principles,</hi> why ſo? <hi>becauſe he ſaies, becauſe you cannot ſhew that this precept given to the parents is neceſſarily inferred out of Scripture.</hi> So now he is upon the minor of the former Syllogiſm: he would then prove it by
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:40740:416"/> a negative Induction. <hi>Not out of the Inſtitution of our Saviour; for he alſo inſtituted the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, not neceſſary for Infants.</hi> Anſ. firſt this is no argument; it doth not follow from the denial of one ſpecies to another: becauſe he did not inſtitute the Euchariſt as neceſſary for infants; threfore he did not inſtitute the Sacrament of baptiſm as neceſſary for Infants. 2. they know there is not the ſame reaſon for the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt for Infants as for the Inſtitution of baptiſm. For this is adminiſtred to the child without its own faith; the other is adminiſtred upon faith to confirmation. 3. If they will be ruled by tradition and the authority of the Church; the Euchariſt was accounted alſo as neceſſary for Infants. Now that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition came from Chriſt as his inſtitution or not, if it did, then there is ſome reaſon for baptiſm to Infants: if not, how ſhall we believe tradition or the authority of the Church.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, <hi>not out of ſubſtitution to Circumciſion: for ſo it ſhould not be neceſſary to women.</hi> To be even with them, The high Prieſt was only of males: the <hi>Pope</hi> ſucceeds the high Prieſt: therefore the Popedome was not competible to <hi>Ioane:</hi> ſome of them would fain have ſomewhat for woman to be proportionable to Circumciſion of males towards the taking away of original ſinne, which ſhould be an object of tradition; But as the unmarried was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the parent; ſo the woman included under her huſband, as to this.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch another argument we have, then it ſhould be neceſſary only for thoſe <hi>of the Iewiſh nation.</hi> As if Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was inioyned to the <hi>Iew</hi> upon the <hi>quatenus</hi> of the nation, and not as they were members of the Church, under the ſame Covenant with Chriſtians, as to the ſubſtance thereof: and therefore <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaies of ſome of thoſe under the law, that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> though not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they were reall Chriſtians, or in effect Chriſtans, though not in denomination.
<pb n="924" facs="tcp:40740:417"/> That which followes was caſt in by me <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and not as ſuch a decretory argument, namely, <q>beſides what may be ſuppoſed by the baptiſm of whole families. And therefore he needed not to have ſaid, <hi>it is no evident conſequence.</hi>
               </q> It was never intended for ſuch. <hi>Valeat quantum valere poteſt.</hi> And yet if it be as probable or more that in all thoſe families complexively there were ſome at leaſt, if but one or two Infants, this conſequence, I think I may ſay, is better then any they have given us to prove their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</p>
            <p>At the end of this number he ſaies, <hi>I inſiſt not upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities I alledged out of St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>St.</hi> Chryſ. <hi>becauſe I deal with one who little regards authority confeſſed to be the Fathers.</hi> Anſ. He might firſt have anſwered what I ſaid to his cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> but it ſeems by his neglect either that the Fathers are not for him or he not for the Fathers; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both; and the latter becauſe the former. He is not for the Fathers becauſe they are not for him. And let them conſider that of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 4. <hi>b. de Bap. contra Don.</hi> 28. <hi>ch. Tamen veraciter conjicere poſſumus quid valeat in parvulis baptiſmi Sacramentum ex circumciſione carnis quam prior popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus accepit.</hi> Notwithſtanding we may truly gueſſe what the Sacrament of Baptiſm does avail in infants out of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the fleſh, which the former people received. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> muſt think Scripture good againſt Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, but not for us againſt them, who make better uſe of it as a tradition.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 62.</note>And now to make an end of his <hi>long Chap.</hi> as he ſaies himſelf (and I ſay ſo too, but it might have been made ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by him by halfe) he ſaies he concludes, as I would have him, namely that <hi>theſe points were and ought to be determined by the Church upon neceſſity of Salvation.</hi> He ſaies now, This I prove by this argument, <hi>This point and all the former are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed with an infallible aſſent, but we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any point with an infallible aſſent unleſs it be determined by infallible authority. And the authority of the Scripture hath
<pb n="925" facs="tcp:40740:417"/> not determined theſe points;</hi> then ſince no other <hi>infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can be found on Earth, if we deny the authority of the Church to be infallible, her authority muſt needs be infallible.</hi> Anſ. after a long chap. to make his word good, he makes as long an argument which might have been put into two lines. But part of his book was to be length. But we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in ſhort firſt to the major propoſition; if he meanes when they are believed they are to be believed with an infallible aſſent, we grant it; or when they are clearely propoſed, are ſo to be believed, we grant it: but if he means it thus, that this point and all the former are neceſſary to be believed with an infallible aſſent, upon neceſſity of Salvation, it is denied. And he hath not nor can prove it: 2. As to his aſſuming that the authority of the Scriptures hath not determined theſe points; we ſay firſt that ſo farre as they are neceſſary, they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Scripture. And 2. they are not ſo clearly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Scripture, becauſe they are not ſo neceſſary. And yet we may ſay as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in ſuch a caſe about intellectuall viſion <hi>lib.</hi> 12 <hi>de gen ad literam cap.</hi> 25, <hi>Aliud eſt errare in his quae videt, aliud errare quia non videt.</hi> We do not erre in ſeing them in Scriptures, but we do erre becauſe we do not ſee them.

               <hi>CHAP. IV. The</hi> Church is not an infallible <hi>Iudge.</hi> The firſt Number is a Preface depending upon hopes of the former diſcourſe: But to this we ſay nothing, ſave only that they ſhall never be rewarded for ſuch hope, unleſs they can prove their word to be the Word of God.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FIrſt thoſe words Matthew</hi> 16.19. <hi>ſpoken to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, allow the Church a ſecurity from ever admitting any doctrine ſo pernicious, that the gates of hell may prevaile againſt her.</hi> Anſ. firſt though theſe words were ſpoken to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> yet it doth not hence follow that they were ſpoken of St. <hi>Peter</hi> excluſively to the reſt. And then the Fathers, as before, underſtood it of his faith, not of his perſon: and of his faith objectively, not ſubjectively. And then 3. this reſpects not only the Church repraeſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but the Church formall, againſt which principally the gates of hell do not prevaile; and ſo the words runne hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly for the Church, that the words <hi>allow the Church ſecurity from ever admitting any doctrine ſo pernicious, that the gates of hell may prevaile againſt her.</hi> And therefore upon theſe conſiderations, we flatly deny to him the following words, <hi>that this promiſe made to the Church is that which mainely makes for my purpoſe,</hi> and ſurely that which follows
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:40740:418"/> makes for us, and may be a fourth anſwer to the former words; <hi>whether the Church be built upon St.</hi> Peter <hi>and his ſucceſſours, or upon the faith of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>is not the thing I chiefely aime at: my aime is to find a Church built on a rock ſo ſtrong that no errour ſhall ever overthrow it.</hi> So then if we aſſume that the inviſible Church is ſuch, we are agreed. Only my adverſary ſeems to have more mind to retreat then to retract. But my adverſary will have it to be underſtood of the repreſentative Church, becauſe he ſaies; he is now aſſured <hi>the Church ſhall never be a neſt of errours, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, ſuperſtitious; wickedly aſſuming the authority of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Tribunal without ſufficient warrant: all or any of thoſe things would bring her to the gates of hell; they being all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable impieties.</hi> Anſ. Now we ſhall ſee that this makes not for him. He was for the Roman Church; was he not? And yet will not here meddle how this concerns the Roman Church. then how doth this make for him? In the former treatiſe of his, this Text was meant of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſours: and now he will not meddle with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes St. <hi>Peter</hi> or his ſucceſſours. Will theſe things here be reconciled till <hi>Tiſhby</hi> comes? 2. This makes for me; not only that he is not willing, as it ſeems, to ſtand his ground (which <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and <hi>Peron</hi> and the Rhemiſts ſtand upon) but alſo becauſe the <hi>promiſe</hi> is made to the Catholique Church. Thus then, their Church is not the Catholique Church: the promiſe is made to the Catholique Church, therefore not to them. The Roman Church may be a neſt of errours, idolatrous, ſuperſtitious, wickedly aſſuming the authority of an infallible Tribunal without ſufficient authority; though the Catholique Church be not ſuch, nor doth aſſume ſuch authority; as the errours of a particular Church are not charged duly upon the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church; ſo the privileges of the univerſal Church are not infeoffed upon a particular.</p>
            <p>Well, but now we will do as he bids us and be patient till he <hi>ſhew in the next chapter,</hi> how this concernes the <hi>Roman
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:40740:419"/> Church.</hi> But ſhall I have my five anſwers anſwered then; for he ſaies here that I <hi>begin to ſay nothing againſt</hi> him <hi>untill I begin to ſay ſixthly.</hi> So then I muſt be thought to ſay nothing againſt him, becauſe he hath nothing to ſay to what I ſaid in thoſe five anſwers.</p>
            <p>The ſixth anſwer then he takes notice of, and it came in thus; he had aſſerted the Church ſecure from <hi>all damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive errour.</hi> I took upon advantage this, as taking thoſe words diſtinctively; that though it was not free from all errour yet from errour damnative. And I gave him good reaſon why he ſhould take thoſe words ſo, becauſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are not like to be the Church, unto which that priviledge is granted. Upon this I argued againſt their infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, according to the opinion alſo of Mr. <hi>Knot.</hi> Therefore he now waves this debate, and ſaies he argued <hi>ad hominem;</hi> but we will hunt him out of this refuge too. They cannot argue thus out of our principles, becauſe we ſay this of the univerſal Church; not of a particular Church. No Church of one denomination is ſecure from damnative er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, therefore cannot they ultimately improve, what we grant to the univerſal Church, for their uſe. But 2. He could not yet from hence conclude that <hi>no body ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for following the guidance of the Church.</hi> For not to ſay again that this is not appliable to the Roman Church, which is not the Catholique Church: yet may we not follow the univerſal Church abſolutely, becauſe it is not in all points infallible. For ſo conſequently, we might be bound to follow errour. Yea 3. Since according to our principles it is not exempted from all errour; according to Mr. <hi>Knot's</hi> principles it cannot be our guide. Yea 4. To Follow the Church in an errour, may be damnative though the errour may not be damnative: becauſe another not knowing it to be an error may hold it without damnation: but if I knew it to be an error &amp; yet follow it, I incurre damnation, becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a known truth. And 5. Since the univerſal Church cannot ſhew its charter of being exempted from all errour, it is not
<pb n="929" facs="tcp:40740:419"/> neceſſary for her <hi>alwaies to have ſuch a viſible exiſtence as is neceſſary to afford a guidance.</hi> So then, whereas he askes me, <hi>by what Logique do you inferre, that becauſe the Church is ſecured from all damnative errour, therefore according to my doctrine ſhe is not ſecured from other errours;</hi> I anſwer, it is very true, <hi>ſimpliciter loquendo,</hi> that the affirmation of one ſpecies doth not allwaies include a negation of the other; namely when that which is affirmed is not a conſtitutive difference thereof. But conſidering his words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and giving him good reaſon why he ſhould mean them ſo, I could not be blamed for gueſſing that he meant them ſo.</p>
            <p>Yea the words which he hath uſed in this chapter for expreſſing the priviledge of the Church, are yet ſo put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geher that they may ſeem ſuſpiciouſly to bear ſuch a conſtruction. Neither does he here poſitively deny, as would become his confidence, this diſtinction. To put it then to an iſſue; I ſhall put them to their choice, how thoſe words ſhall be underſtood, whether diſtinctively, or by way of epithet. If diſtinctively, then my conſequences ſtand good upon that ground. If not, then have they ſuch a task upon them which all the Roman wit and induſtry will never throughly performe; for firſt then muſt they ſay that either all errour is damnative (which indeed ſhould have been proved upon former urging as much reaſon for all ſins to be mortal as all errours to be damnative; and more too; ſince ſin hath the guilt of the will, ſimple errour hath not) or elſe there may be errours not damnative (which makes for us againſt the neceſſity of an infallible judge as to all points) or that the Church cannot erre at all. And then here will be a double labour to prove (and indeed a double errour to ſay) Firſt, that it hath not erred. 2. that it cannot erre. If the latter, then to be ſure the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: but if the fonmer, then not preſently the latter. Yea if they will then ſtand to it, that the Church is ſecure from all errour whatſoever; then their Church is not the Church. And the conſequence is good and ſtrong, for that Church can erre becauſe it hath erred in the Latin Bible;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40740:420"/> in the ſupernumerary Canon of Scripture; in the point of Tranſubſtantiation: in Communion under one kind: In their Counſails; as hath been ſhewed already; and in the point of merit <hi>Ex condigno,</hi> if the 30. Canon of the 6. Seſſ. of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council be compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. The Canon of the Council ſpeaks an Anathema to him that ſhall ſay, that the good works of a juſtified man do not <hi>vere mareri,</hi> truly merit increaſe of grace, conſecution of eternal life, if they ſhall die in grace, and alſo increaſe of glory. The Canon of the Scripture ſaith, I account that <q>the ſufferings of this life are not worthy to be compared with the glory wich ſhall be revealed: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, do not weigh with.</q> Now whether Scripture be our rule of faith or not, this muſt be an errour; ſince they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Scripture to be true and infallible, For, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contradictory to truth is falſe, this is contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Scripture which is true. In this they have erred from the Latin Fathers in the ſence of the word; from the Greek Fathers in the matter; and from the Scripture, which is our rule, and was the rule of the Church until a Church roſe up which would not be ruled. And let them take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice too that <hi>ſufferings</hi> are the beſt part of our obedience: and if they are not worthy, how ſhould good actions merit. More errours of their Church might be named, but one errour with them is enough to contradict infallibility, and to diſcharge us of following their Church.</p>
            <p>He ſaies then I quarrel with <hi>one of the Cardinal vertues even Prudence herſelf.</hi> Anſ. I think I may quarrel with one of the Cardinal vertues. <hi>Prudence</hi> is one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal vertues, in Morality: and one of the Cardinal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in Divinity. Prudence is the politique vertue; and ſo is their Religion a politique Religion. And if a man may proceed prudently in the choice of his Religion, then he doth not beleive firſt, and then underſtand; as yet the vulgar Latin reads that text; but we muſt underſtand firſt, and then beleive. Prudence is a Moderatreſs of actions;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40740:420"/> not a miſtreſs of Faith. And how doth Prudence conſiſt with implicite Faith, which believes what it doth not know? Prudence is a vertue of reaſon, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed to Faith. And if we may proceed prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the chuſing of our Religion, then we may well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the judgment of diſcretion in matters of Faith, and therefore are not ſimply bound to take upon truſt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Church obtrudes.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>Then you conclude all the force my former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hath, it hath from Scripture. Is not my Argument the better for this.</hi> Yes, If the Argument were grounded in Scripture, it were better upon that ground, than upon any other, but this Argument is not good, becauſe it is not taken from Scripture. Scripture is the beſt Argument in <hi>Theſi;</hi> but in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> it is not well applied. We like it well that he goes about to prove the Church by Scripture, which is the <hi>higheſt principle:</hi> But let them not give us ſuch a ſenſe of Scripture which belongs not to their cauſe, unleſs againſt it.</p>
            <p>In the next number which he nameth the fourth (but then it ſeems the third is loſt by the way) he ſaith I ſtumble again at the ſenſes of <hi>damnable errours.</hi> Anſ. No,<note place="margin">N. 4.</note> For I diſcourſe of it by a Dilemma, or diſjunctive, which will take in either ſenſe: but he is not willing to move this ſtone again; therefore he ſtumbles at it.</p>
            <p>Another Text he builds upon St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 18.17.<note place="margin">N. 5.</note> 
               <q>If he will not hear the Church let him be to thee as a publican, or a Heathen.</q> Upon this he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mes an argument, God Commandeth us to hear the Church and obey her: <hi>but no kinde of errour little or great can be incurred by following Gods command.</hi> Anſ. I am glad he hath any ſuch forme of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which would more clearly and handſomely ſhorten the debate, we therefore anſwer to it; paſſing by all diſcepiation about the ſenſe of the Church there, or the quality of the cauſe. We ſay then, if he underſtands the major ſo as that God abſolutely, univerſally commandeth
<pb n="932" facs="tcp:40740:421"/> us to heare and obey the Church then the concluſion were good, and we could not erre in following the Church. But ſo the minor is denied. God hath not abſolutely and univerſaly commanded us ſo to heare and obey the Church. If he underſtands the major ſpecificatively and in things lawfull, then we can grant the minor; but then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will not be univerſall, will be peccant <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſo not conclude contradictorily to us, who do not diſpute here againſt all obedience to the Church, nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as if we would have none; but againſt all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence affirmatively, as being not bound in faith to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>And therefore need he not come in with a reliefe, to ſuccour his diſcourſe, by ſaying from me, <hi>it is impoſſible to be obliged to aſſent to an errour though it be not damnable.</hi> This true, but not well applied to me unles he can prove Gods command for abſolute obedience in whatſoever the Church propoſeth. But as this is true, ſo it is pertinent for me againſt him, that though the univerſal Church cannot erre in points neceſſary, where errour would be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, yet could we not be bound univerſally to follow upon that account; becauſe no man can be bound to aſſent to an errour though not damnative.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it follow from the Text <hi>therfore meerely and purely for not hearing the Church a man is to be held a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can or a Heathen,</hi> Unles he underſtands by not <hi>hearing,</hi> not ſubmitting, if he doth not underſtand it ſo, it doth not follow: if he does underſtand it ſo, this is not to his purpoſe: becauſe though we may be bound to ſubmit to the Church, yet we may not be bound to believe the Church: theſe are two things which he ſhould have diſtinguiſhed. Therefore cannot he prove from hence that the Church cannot erre. He is to be accounted an Heathen or publican upon not ſubmiting to the Church in regard of authority; not upon not aſſenting, becauſe of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. And therefore though we be all bound ſimply to
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:40740:421"/> avoid excommunication: yet if the caſe were put that we muſt aſſent to an errour or elſe be excommunicated: we take the cenſure, and leave the errour; and if they will not have proviſo with a <hi>clave non errante,</hi> for the cenſures of the Church, then what condition was <hi>Pope Honorius</hi> in, who was excommunicated, as before; If God binds againſt errour, and the Church, as we ſuppoſe, bind to it, we can ſay preſently, that the Church cannot abſolve without God, but God can abſolve without the Church. And this anſwereth the next verſe in the Goſpell, as he produceth it.</p>
            <p>But the former Anſwer he would take off in the next words by an argument. <hi>To ſwerve from Gods word is to erre. But this Text proveth that the</hi> (the Church) <hi>cannot erre.</hi> Anſ. The major is indeed true: but the Text doth not prove the minor; therefore it is falſe; becauſe he ſaith the text pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And indeed if ſhe could, the meerely not hearing her could not deſerve that a man ſhould deſerve to be accounted according to Gods judgment a publican and heathen.</hi> Anſ. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Refractorines expoſeth thereunto, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of infallibility. And yet am I ſtill of this opinion, that that Text concernes not matters of faith; but of treſpaſs betwen Brother and Brother, and therefore that Text is not to his purpoſe. This and more he ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to here.</p>
            <p>But yet I followed him, and ſaid that a man is not bound to believe the cenſure is juſt unles it apeare to be ſo. To this he ſaies, this laſt aſſertion of yours is very <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> doctrine. <hi>For the unanimous opinion of Learned men is, that a man is bound to hold his ſuperiours cenſure or command to be juſt unles the contrary appeares evident.</hi> Anſ, firſt then this determination of the caſe by Learned men ſuppoſeth that a thing may appear evident againſt the ſuperiours cenſure or command. So that by conſequence they have the <hi>unanimous opinion of Leanred men</hi> againſt them in two points, firſt that a thing may be evident without the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40740:422"/> propoſal of the Church: for it may be evident againſt it. 2. Then that the Church may make an injuſt cenſure or command. But for his opinion he nameth three Learned men, <hi>Chillingworth, Hooker, Laud.</hi> So he: as to the firſt, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> he hath nothing for him in his 108 <hi>nu.</hi> 
               <q>For he maketh uſe of this rule, [In caſes of uncertainty we are not to leave our ſuperiour, nor caſt off his obedience nor publiquely oppoſe his decrees</q>
[But how is this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our caſe? Indeed it was his beſt courſe not to apply it. Let them then note that this he ſpeakes is <hi>in caſes of uncertainty,</hi> namely about things of queſtion: but we are ultimately upon points neceſſary. And then 2. He ſpeaks againſt <hi>caſting off obedience:</hi> but we are upon aſſent of judgment. And then 3. The rule he uſeth ſpeakes that we ſhould not <hi>publiquely oppoſe his decrees;</hi> but we are upon the negative only, whether he may not ſuſpend his opinion. And hence the Author diſcourſeth, that we may leave them, we may caſt them off, and oppoſe <q>
                  <hi>them, when we are certaine,</hi> as proteſtants were that what they command God doth countermand.</q> And for the ſecond, as he nameth him; I think, all things conſidered, he hath little from him for his uſe. As the ſcribe at leaſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtooke the quotation: ſo the Author I think miſtook the man. In the places quoted [<hi>pag.</hi> 310. 311. <hi>n.</hi> 110.] there is nothing like. It is true that excellent Author had great cauſe to urge convenent obedience to humane lawes: but he denies intuitive obedience to any law but of God. And therefore if he and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> be joined in the teſtimony, that which anſwered one may anſwer the other. And further, if they will take <hi>p.</hi> 110. And ſo on for <hi>n.</hi> 110. They may finde enough to ſatisfie them of his opinion, that he held Scripture a ſufficient rule in matters neceſſary; and therefore the obedience he urgeth muſt be in thinges of order; which is extrinſecall to our debate and not blind neither, as <hi>p.</hi> 110.</p>
            <p>The third Authority is rightly quoted but not rightly
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40740:422"/> applied out of that excellent book; for it ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly of <hi>externall obedience:</hi> we are upon internall. He ſpeaks for peace: my adverſary ſhould apply it to faith. He ſpeaks it as to private perſons: my adverſary ſhould vltimately apply it to the Church nationall. That which followes is a cavill, that then the private man, <hi>when all comes to all, is the laſt judge; to whoſe ſentence finally all comes to be referred.</hi> Anſ. The private man is no judge authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative to whoſe ſentence finally all comes to be referred, but exerciſeth for himſelf the judgment of diſcretion; "as being to be perſwaded in his own minde as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. And thus much muſt be allowed by my adverſary who lately aſſerted prudence to be of uſe in chuſing Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea if Prudence be tolerated in things of Faith: Sapience is to be commended, which refers to the higheſt principles; and thoſe are of Scripture. And though it be ſome ingenuous prudence to preferre the judgment of a <hi>General Council</hi> or <hi>the Church,</hi> as to the ſuſpenſion of my opinion againſt them: yet ſurely will it be ſapience to reſt my faith in principles of faith. Therefore this and much more of this diſcourſe comes not home to the queſtion, whether God hath bound me to give abſolute aſſent to the definitions of the Church; and to believe their commands to be juſt, <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> becauſe theirs: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Neither is it <hi>impoſſible that a General Council ſhould not ſee it.</hi> There is a double impoſſiblity, ſimple and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical: and then Moral. The Simple impoſſiblity would make Faith; but ſuch is denied. The Moral, If it were granted could not make ſuch a Faith as they ſtand for, namely an infallible aſſent. But the Moral impoſſibility which is no more than a great difficulty, is not to be yeilded neither, ſince the <hi>Trent</hi> Council. They might as well not ſee that which was <hi>Evident,</hi> as they did ſee that which was not Evident: Communion under both kindes was Evident in Scripture, and the practiſe of the Church: yet notwithſtanding they would ſee what was not Evident,
<pb n="936" facs="tcp:40740:423"/> Communion-under one kind. And therefore leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under both kindes ſhould ſeem more Evident, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> prudently informes that ſome of their learned men would not conſtrue the 2. of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of Sacramental participation.</p>
            <p>And the ground he goes upon is ſandy, <hi>that which is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evident will of it ſelf appear to be ſo, or at leaſt to the moſt judicious, upright, and beſt inſtructed Prelats of the Church.</hi> Anſ. This may appear to them, <hi>de facto</hi> not ſo. Were not the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers ſo? And yet they did not ſee what was Evident in the point of the Communion, and in ſome other points too, as ſome of their own Religion did think, as we have it in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council. 2. What a caſe ſhould the poor people be in, ſince <hi>populus non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguit,</hi> and yet they muſt compare the moſt judicious, and moſt upright, and beſt inſtructed Prelats. Thirdly, Take the Fathers of all ages and places; and then their Doctrines will not abide the teſt, as hath been made good to them by Biſhop <hi>Jewel.</hi> And therefore their Doctrines are not <hi>Evident</hi> by their own Principle, becauſe not Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them. And then fourthly, ſomewhat Evident to them the Romans have caſhiered, Infant Communion, the Millenary opinion, <hi>trine immerſion,</hi> ſtanding up in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, therefore they had beſt betake themſelves to <hi>more than humane aſſiſtance, namely, from the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His debate afterwards about the conſideration of the cauſe of the Cenſure, will come to little, if it be conſidered <hi>that the act of not hearing the Church,</hi> is ambiguous; and may relate either to the non-aſſent, or to the contempt. The former doth not ſimply expoſe him to the Cenſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: the latter may. And if he underſtood his own terms, he muſt rather take them of the latter, becauſe he ſpeaks of an <hi>act of not hearing.</hi> For the non-aſſent is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to an act; and ſo is the Greek conſiderable <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> this is it which makes him <hi>truely guilty of not hearing the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="937" facs="tcp:40740:423"/>
            <p>That which follows in way of conceſſion, is deſtructive of his building; for he grants an errability of the key, in which caſe the Cenſure is not <hi>ratified in Heaven.</hi> So then, how ſhall we know whether any be <hi>truely guilty.</hi> For as the Church cannot be infallible to us at all, to believe it, if not infallible in all, as Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> argues; and my Adverſary too, if he denies the diſtinction of <hi>damnative errours:</hi> ſo it cannot bind infallibly in any, if not in all, though there be a diſtance betwixt Faith and fact, the proportion is the ſame. And yet again, if they will divide here by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infallibility in Faith, fallibility in Fact; why do they urge this Text, which reſpects the latter?</p>
            <p>And therefore that which follows. <hi>And ſo the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in denouncing excommunication againſt ſuch a perſon,</hi> in dependance upon the premiſes, is as much as to ſay, the Church cannot erre, when the key doth not erre. Yet it might have erred <hi>in ſenſu diviſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> which is ſufficient for our purpoſe, becauſe our diſpute is upon the point of poſſibility <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid: It is neceſſary that that it be while it be; yet was it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary to be before it was: for that deſtroys the diſtinction of things contingent from things neceſſary. And therefore what follows hereupon, if I ſhould anſwer he would account neceſſary to be anſwered, when it is not.</p>
            <p>At the end of this Section he ſaith, You <hi>highly wrong</hi> St. Athanaſius <hi>to ſay he did not hear the Church.</hi> Anſ. I ſhould be very loath to be truely guilty of this: and ſurely, if he grants that the Church may be miſtaken in the <hi>fact,</hi> he may be miſtaken in this Cenſure; which he ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in <hi>ſecundum allegata et probata.</hi> I ſaid this, St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> did differ from the reſt of the Church, when the whole world did groan under Arrianiſme. So he did not hear the Church, as differing in opinion, though it is not ſaid that he did not hear the Church, as diſobeying the Cenſure.</p>
            <pb n="938" facs="tcp:40740:424"/>
            <p>Here he ſuppoſeth that upon the virtue of former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he may conclude of the Church, <hi>No, She cannot erre in an errour not damnable.</hi> No? Let that which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly granted be compared with this, and we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the contrary. To excommunicate a perſon who is not to be excommunicated, is to erre. The Church may excommunicate a perſon not to be excommunicated; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the minor is as good as confeſſed by him, becauſe the Church may be miſtaken in the <hi>fact.</hi> Nay he ſaith it in terms <hi>[and ſo there may be an errour in the miſtake of the fact.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He proceeds, <hi>Hence that common Doctrine of Antiquity, that it is not poſſible to have a juſt cauſe of ſeparating from the Church.</hi> Anſ. Beſides the nullity of this upon the want of a true ground, as before; he doth miſreport the axiom; or elſe he muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>Separating.</hi> There is no juſt cauſe of Schiſm; for, the propoſition hath in it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; becauſe if there be a juſt cauſe, it is not Schiſm, but though every Schiſm is a Separation, every Separation is not Schiſm. Take then ſeparation in ſpecie for Schiſm, ſo it may be true; but a Separation from a Church impoſing errours in Faith, and things unlawful in practice is not without a juſt cauſe; and therefore is it not Schiſm. It is not without a juſt cauſe by his former confeſſion juſt now in thoſe words. <hi>So men ſhould be bound to aſſent unto an errour, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi> And again this is to be underſtood of Separating from the Catholique Church, or from a particular Church for that order wherein it agrees with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. But this is not our caſe; for the Roman is but a particular Church; and we ſeparated upon Catholique Principles, that ſo we might hold union with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church. And then again there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a national reformation, and a private Separation. And therefore yet the diſtinction is not diſabled, namely of ſeparating from the errours and not from the Church, unleſs it were better proved that the <hi>Church is ſecured from all errour;</hi> which that text doth not prove. Then goes he
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:40740:424"/> on to take away ſomewhat I ſaid to the text in my firſt and fifth anſwer to it. He claps them together, and would make me to conclude thus, <hi>this maketh nothing for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the univerſal Church.</hi> Anſ. Let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber again (for <hi>Aquinas</hi> tells us that we cannot forget natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles) that the whole is greater than the part. I allow much to a particular Church in correſpondence with the Univerſal (therefore little to their Church.) And if I do reply that this text belongs alſo to particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, then this doth redound to the honour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church. And that this doth belong to particular Prelats to excommunicate, he himſelf doth confeſs in this Section. Therefore muſt he conclude that I conclude for the Univerſal Church. And yet moreover, in all this long gloſs upon the text, how little have we had of that upon which all in this diſcourſe turns, namely whether Authority of excommunication (be it in the Univerſal or a particular Church) reſpects not formally the contempt, not the non-aſſent. Let them ſpeak leſs, or more to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And yet again he would drive it on in a looſe way, that we have a command from God to hear the Church abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and univerſally.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe he ſaies, <hi>Thoſe who diſobey the judges, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Common-wealth: ſo generally ſpeaking, thoſe who diſobey the Prelats of the particular Church, diſobey the univerſal Church, commanding her to proceed according to her Decrees, Canons, and definitions.</hi> Anſ. Here is not much, and for them leſs. A Common-wealth is a term ambiguous; and may be taken ſtrictly or largely: ſtrictly in the form; largely as including head and members. And in this large ſenſe may be conſidered with more reſpect to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or to the Head; in <hi>confuſo,</hi> or in <hi>capite.</hi> If he takes it in the ſtrict ſence; it is not to any purpoſe; becauſe there is a different reaſon of laws in the Common-wealth and in the Church: For in a Common-wealth ſo, Laws
<pb n="940" facs="tcp:40740:425"/> proceed from them as the efficient thereof: but in the Church, truths and duties do come from God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch caſes the diſobedience reflects upon God. Now the caſe we diſpute upon is in neceſſary truths and duties. If he underſtand a Common-wealth largely, and then with more particular repute to the people, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the judges doth not reflect upon them, unleſs objectively and conſequently, becauſe though they are not their Judges by way of Authority, yet they are their Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in way of End, for their good. If it be taken with more relation to the head, whoſe judges they are by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative commiſſion it is true that the diſobedience to the Judge doth redound upon him: but here is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, for particular Prelats do not depend upon the univerſal Church, as Judges do upon the Head of a Common-wealth; becauſe Biſhops have their Authority by divine right, which was contended for hotly in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, and had proceeded affirmatively had not the Roman Court bandied againſt it. And then alſo the matter of diſobedience we ſpeak of is from God, not the univerſal Church: but the matter of Civil diſobedience to the Judge is from the Head. And then again we do not ſpeak of diſobedience poſitive (which my Adverſary doth inſtance in) but in obedience, which is negative. And then again particular Prelats are not ſo bound in things of particular order, as the people are bound to the Laws of a particular Nation. And alſo then this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Adverſaries prejudice; for the particular Prelats of their Church have not proceeded according to the Canons, Decrees, and definitions of the univerſal Church, as hath been ſhewed. And alſo this is againſt them, becauſe then my Adverſary confeſſeth that this text under debate is competible fairly to particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and therefore they have no reaſon to appropriate it to themſelves. And ſo upon the whole matter we can ſay as much in a due reſpect to the Catholique Church, as
<pb n="941" facs="tcp:40740:425"/> they do here, and yet hold our own. So then he doth not contradict here. And yet again he is importunate to prove that diſobedience to the Church at laſt redounds to Chriſt and God, out of the 16. of <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. <q>they have not rejected thee but me.</q> Anſ. Surely they had better have ſuppoſed this truth than proved it. Firſt, and again, we are not upon <hi>diſobedience</hi> but inobedience: not upon rejecting Authority which God had veſted in <hi>Samuel,</hi> but upon ſuſpending aſſent to a truth propoſed. And then 2. In the time of <hi>Samuel</hi> it was a plain <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the people had Laws and Ordinances given them by divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction: but it is yet to be proved, whether what Churches do enjoyn do come from God immediatly to the Prelats. And therefore ſince that caſe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in it, the diſcourſe ſuits not our queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Chriſt to his diſciples (the firſt Prelats of the Church) he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me.</hi> Anſ. Thoſe Diſciples were not in his ſenſe Prelats; for the Apoſtles were the Prelates, but theſe whom Chriſt here ſpake to, were the ſeventy two Diſciples or Elders. Therefore he miſtakes in the quality of the perſons. Secondly this was by Chriſt appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to miniſterial acts of preaching; theſe other Prelats ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome do; yet if they did, here were a miſtake in the qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the matter, which with us is in point of juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The main Text, then is, St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.2. The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, all whatſoever therefore they ſay unto you, to keep and do. He ſaies here, <hi>Mark theſe moſt ample words, all therefore whatſoever.</hi> Anſ. we have mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and yet cannot this Text be underſtood redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatively &amp; without exception, becauſe the Phariſees did teach errours. He ſaies then, <hi>many of them publiquely did teach errours though not by publique authority.</hi> Anſ, So then they did teach errours, and publiquely. This which is affirmative is enough for us: let them prove the negative for them. But this is ſtrange, that they ſhould teach and teach publiquely, and not by publique authority. If
<pb n="942" facs="tcp:40740:426"/> they did teach, they did teach upon authority, though not with that authority as Chriſt. If they did teach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, then they had publique authority. And doth not he ſeem to profeſs that authority was veſted in them by a lawful ſucceſſion of <hi>Moſes?</hi> And did my adverſary thinke that they could ſit in <hi>Moſe's</hi> chaire, and yet not have publique authority?<note place="margin">He calls them the <hi>lawfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of</hi> Moſes.</note> But it may be they were not in the chaire, when they did teach errours, no? How then is it ſaid, the Scribes and Phariſees ſet in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair? And how then did they <hi>teach publiquely?</hi> But they were not in the chair of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they did teach errours. Will they ſay ſo? But in their ſenſe they were in the chair of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe they underſtand thereby authority: if they doe not, they are taken; for then they muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of teaching the doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and then by conſequent, <hi>all whatſoever</hi> muſt be underſtood as ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal thereunto. And if they would underſtand it thus, we would alſo ſubſcribe this propoſition, that when they did teach errours they were not in the chair of <hi>Moſes.</hi> As namely when they did teach for doctrines the traditions of men. Alas if this ſhould be applied to the <hi>Pope</hi> in his chair, how ſhould the people be able to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt teaching <hi>errours publiquely</hi> (which my adverſary doth acknowledge) and teaching them publiquely with <hi>publique authority,</hi> which he denies? They who formerly have told us that it is ſo eaſie a way to find by the Church to Heaven, do now ſay that which ſhews it is an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to find the Church teaching by publique authority. One being imperfect in ſight asked his ſervant, whether there was not ſuch a thing in the window: and the Servant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Maſter whether there were ſuch a window: they tell us that there is in the Church infallibility taught by publique authority: and others aske the queſtion where is that Church, and when ſhall we know when it teacheth ſo.</p>
            <p>He tells us that they cannot do any thing againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>when they proceed by way of defining with publique authority.</hi> Yea, but we muſt have another infallibility to aſſure us
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:40740:426"/> that they do now thus define. Let them infallibly define when the Church doth infallibly define, ſince all good diſcourſe begins with a definition. And then let them tell us by what method we may come to the knowledge of this propoſition, that the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Jews condemned Chriſt by private authority.</p>
            <p>Neither is that to be ſwallowed,<note place="margin">Acts. 3.17.</note> that <hi>the Church to the full hath now as much reaſon to be heard as the old jewiſh Church then.</hi> For if he takes <hi>the Church</hi> here for the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, it were more likely indeed what he ſaies: but how is that poſſible to make an addreſs to them upon all occaſions, unles there were a ſtanding Repreſentative. But if he takes <hi>the Church</hi> here for a particular Church by way of an <hi>Individuum vagum,</hi> or determinately, of the Roman, it were indeed poſſible to make with more expedition ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to ſuch: but then it would be ſhewed to be likely that any particular Church of any one denomination ſhould have ſuch priviledges annexed to it, as the <hi>old Iewiſh Church had;</hi> eſpecially if we take in into the account of the <hi>old Iewiſh Church</hi> thoſe extraordinary revelations of God immediately made to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Preiſts and the Prophets, whereof <hi>Malachi</hi> was the laſt. Indeed ſuch an infallibility only will ſerve their turn, but till they prove it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>And as the Synagogues authority was not limited ſo as to be obeyed and heard only in points of treſpaſs betwixt Brother and Brother, but was to be extended to all whatſoever they ſhould order: ſo you cannot (without depreſſing the authority of Chriſts Church who had a better cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, Hebr.</hi> 8.6.) <hi>hinder her power from being extended to all whatſoever ſhe ſhall order.</hi> Anſ. This und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es all. I take the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of my adverſary for my major propoſition: then I aſſume, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the Synagogue had to the whole <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church a particular Church hath to the univerſal Church: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every particular Church is not limited in <hi>authority,</hi> but, as he ſaith of the Synagogue, that its <hi>authority</hi> was not
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:40740:427"/> limited ſo as to be obeyed and heard &amp;c. And then what need of an univerſal Church, &amp; Biſhop &amp; Council? Indeed ſuch a power would be requiſite for the Roman Church becauſe they cannot ſtretch it beyond a particular Church. But this ſpoyles all his diſcourſe in his four firſt Chapters which he ſaies he intended as for the univerſal Church. But what uſe of this when a particular may ſooner and more eaſily decide all, having all authority to command and to be obeyed in all things which ſhe ſhall order? Thus not only the five Patriarchates were independent of any one, and had all Iuriſdiction within their own diviſions; but other Churches nationall, might be independent; and independents might be Churches. And ſince ten men with the Jew made a people, and a people made a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a Synagogue, why may not the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have an <hi>Authority not limited, &amp;c.</hi> And what need then of running to another Church for more authority?</p>
            <p>But neither is his Text in the Hebrewes well underſtood or elſe not well aplied in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For the eſtabliſhment <hi>of a better Covenant upon better promiſes</hi> is not certainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have reſpect to the viſible Church for diſcipline: but to the inviſible Church for ſalvation. It reſpects Chriſt as the Great High Prieſt to ſave his Church by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of himſelf once upon the Croſs for us; not as King of his Church by way of an externall policy, as if the Goverment of his Church were part of his Kingdome, and of his Goſpell. If ſo they give the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the other Diſciplinarian.</p>
            <p>But alſo he takes it ill that the text ſhould be limited to caſe of treſpaſs betwixt Brother and Brother; and he thinks rather it ſhould belong to the caſes of <hi>hereſie</hi> which is a treſpaſs <hi>committed by one Brother againſt all his Brothers and their deareſt Mother the Church, yea</hi> St. Thomas <hi>calls Schiſm of which hereſie is alwaies guilty, the higheſt crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the whole Community.</hi> Anſ. It is one thing to ſay what the text intends; another to ſay what it may be by
<pb n="945" facs="tcp:40740:427"/> diſcourſe accommodated to. The direct reſpect of the text in the ordinary ſenſe of the letter, is clearly carried to caſe of treſpaſs betwixt Brother and Brother. And the Pontifician by his principles and uſe, is ingaged to the ſenſe of the letter prinipally. But 2. <hi>dato non conceſſo,</hi> that it ſhould alſo reſpect caſe of Hereſie, notwithſtanding alſo that the terms [let him be to thee a Heathen or a Publican we rather referre to the Jewiſh Church than the Chriſtian] yet cannot he have from hence what he would, namely the Churches infallibility of Cenſure in points of Faith. For though the Church did infallibly know on which ſide the truth did ſtand in every point of Faith, and therefore what was oppoſite thereunto (for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as he ſaid) and therefore that ſuch a doctrine was to be condemned as Heretical; yet ſince, though the Church do proceed <hi>ſecundum allegata et probata,</hi> it may be miſtaken in the fact, (as he confeſſeth) it may erre in the Cenſure as to a particular perſon; and how then is ſuch a perſon bound to ſubſcribe to ſuch a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as juſt? becauſe he cannot be bound to aſſent to that which is falſe, as he alſo lately confeſſed. It is true in civil cauſes though the ſentence be injuſt, I may and muſt pay the amercement, there being no Law againſt the courſe of Law; and ſo alſo in Eccleſiaſtical caſes, he that is in juſtly excommunicated muſt abide the Cenſure; but all the Authority under Heaven can never make a man beleive in his Conſcience that it is a juſt Cenſure, when he knows himſelf not to be guilty of the fact, namely publiſhing of an heretical Doctrine; and therefore all that can be exacted by man in this caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> paſſive obedience; which the Perſon may yield, though the Conſcience doth not yeild that it is a juſt Cenſure. So that the text is yet preſerved in its integrity againſt binding the Conſcience to believe whatſoever is done by the Church to be right and juſt.</p>
            <p>After this, he would winde himſelf off gradually from
<pb n="946" facs="tcp:40740:428"/> ſuppoſing any infallibility of particular Churches, that ſo all at length might be aſcribed to their Church in <hi>ſolidum;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as he ſaid. And the Authority he would have to fall upon the Pope and a Council: yet he expreſſeth one <hi>Head of the Church and the ſupream Prelat of the Church.</hi> So then; Before, when there was a profeſſed occaſion to diſpute the point whether the Pope were Head of the Church, he was ſhie and cautious and uncategorical: now by the by, and under the winde he can aſſert it ſo that he may not be bound to prove it. We ſee then what reaſon they have to afford Prudence a good place in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Nullum numen ab eſt ſi ſit prudentiarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the main exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical authority, the key is laid upon his ſhoulder, <hi>He is bound to uſe the fullneſs of his power to ſuppreſs the ariſing hereſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſurely they are bound ingenuouſly to ſpeak out whether they mean this <hi>fulneſs of his Authority,</hi> of all the Authority he hath, or of all Authority that the Church hath. There is a fulneſs of the Fountain, there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Veſſel. Do they allow him the fulneſs of the Veſſel? So indeed the <hi>Trent</hi> Council ſeemed rather in a good part thereof to incline, when they urged ſo much to have the title of the Council to be eſtabliſhed <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the whole Church:</hi> for had this proceeded, his power had been ſunk in their power. But if he be the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, my Adverſary muſt allow him the fulneſs of the Fountain; then the controverſie is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined betwixt the Jeſuits, and the Sorboniſts; and the latter are caſt in the ſuit. But then, what need of a Council towards infallibility, when he hath all the Authority in himſelf, as being the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? And then my Adverſary hath not pleaſed the Court and the Jeſuite in joyning the Council as partners in the Authority. Nor do the words enſuing bear good reſpect to the Pope, as Head of the Church, namely, <hi>that he may forbid (if he
<pb n="947" facs="tcp:40740:428"/> feareth danger in the Doctrine) that no ſuch Doctrine may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed until the Church ſhall think it fit.</hi> Are not theſe dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuent terms of the Head (indeed almoſt comminuent, if we may ſay ſo) as if the Head of the univerſal Church, the ordinary Paſtour, and Vicar of Chriſt, Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> could not preſently ſee that there was danger in heretical Doctrine, or could not ſee whether it were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical doctrine <hi>until the Church ſhall think it fit.</hi> I had thought the Pope had been an Independent; and ſhould not have depended upon the Church for a final reſolution at a point heretical. And if the Church muſt meet in a Council to conſider of it, and all Popes be as diſaffected to a Council, as ſome were to the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, what ſhall become of the people in this danger of hereſie? I had thought a Council had been but the vicar of Chriſt His Counſail, and though he did condiſcend ſo far to make uſe of their Counſail, yet he could do all alone by his own Authority. We heard before that particular Prelats had Authority not limited: and muſt my Adverſaries Supreme Prelat be bound to wait for a General Council?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then all muſt be as St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey their Prelats;</hi> So he, Anſ. This he means of Prelats not in <hi>confuſo,</hi> but in <hi>conventu.</hi> And to theſe infallibility ſhould be annexed. So then, Thoſe Prelats who are here meant are infallible. Particular Prelats are here meant: therefore they are infallible; and ſo there will be no need either of a <hi>Supreme Prelat,</hi> or of a Council. And that particular Prelats are here meant, we need not prove to the Pontificians who take too much notice that there Epiſtles were written but upon particular occaſions, and for particular times. And therefore this being written to the Hebrews ſhould not by that account concern us Yea if it were written with an intention for Prelats in a Council, it muſt be written for them <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> not for the preſent times; but for above 300. years after. 2. This relates to thoſe who did watch for their Souls, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="948" facs="tcp:40740:429"/> put <hi>per ſe</hi> is to be underſtood of thoſe that teach the Word; and ſo it correſponds to the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> where thoſe that are ſet over them are ſpecified by teaching the Word. The obedience then there injoyned reſpects thoſe as teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the the Word, not formally as exerciſing authority of Jurisdiction. And therefore that Text is not here well applied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus far the power of the Supreme Prelat is extended by the conſent of the whole Church.</hi> Anſ. We ſee then their own differences to be ſuch as that they may be aſhamed to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us with our differences, and we not aſhamed to be upbraided. Can my Adverſaries exactly point out the <hi>maximum quod ſic</hi> of the power of the Supreme Prelat of the univerſal Church? Muſt he that is by them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the Pillar of the Church have his Pillars ſet him, beyond which he muſt not budge? Tell it not to the Canoniſts, and the Courtiers of <hi>Rome.</hi> As <hi>Cyril</hi> of Jeruſalem notes that the Sea where it ſtints in the flote makes in a ſimilitude a Line, which God hath ſet it that it ſhould not paſs: So have my Adverſaries ſet a Line to the Roman Sea; hitherto it may go, <hi>by the conſent of the whole Church.</hi> So then the members may appoint the Head what operations and how far it ſhall perform, and the Head ſhall not be onely influxive upon them, but they rather upon it. This opinion will make Popes ſhie of Councils, if he hath his power extended by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For they do not mean the <hi>conſent of the whole Church</hi> to be of the confuſaneous multitude; do they? if they do, then the Church in this ſenſe ſhall be the firſt ſubject of Eccleſiaſtical power. Yea, If they alſo mean it of the Church in a Council, how is the Pope ſucceſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Pope muſt be limited by the Church; St. <hi>Peter.</hi> as they ſay, was Prince of the Apoſtles immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Chriſt. And ſurely according to this reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Bellarmins</hi> diſtinction will come to naught, who ſaies the power of Kings is not by divine right, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="949" facs="tcp:40740:429"/> of the people: but the Popes power is, for it comes not from the Church, but Chriſt, as in his 3. <hi>b. de verb. Dei cap.</hi> 9. And then he is not the Rock and foundation of the Church; but the Church of him, and ſo the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Monarchy muſt be ſlighted. How far is this from that Italian who preſented a book to <hi>Paulus</hi> the fifth with this inſcription, PaULo V<hi rend="sup">to</hi>. Vice Deo, out of which one picked the number of the beaſt, 666.</p>
            <p>But therefore my Adverſary goes at the Spaniſh rate, very ſuſpenſively, <hi>in omnem eventum;</hi> as being diſpoſed to a pauſe betwixt the affirmative and the negative; and he ſaith, <hi>Now though the Supreme Head of the Church be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as St.</hi> Peter was, and ſo on in a long ſpeech. Well, but doth this affirm? or is it a meer ſuppoſition, which doth <hi>ponere nihil?</hi> He hath carried the Pope up to the clouds, and there he ſtaies: but let them come out of the clouds, and tell us plainly, whether we muſt take a cloud for <hi>Iuno.</hi> Such irreſolution doth not become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. He ſeems to make him as infallible as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he ſhould be Supreme Head of the Church; (and yet St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not Supreme Head of the Church, if the reſt of the Apoſtles be included in the term [Church] as members) and yet he muſt not be as infallible as St. <hi>Peter;</hi> becauſe caſes of difficulty muſt be referred to the Council. It follows, <hi>yet if he ſeeth this newly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doctrine fit to be declared hereſie, if it be ſo; or to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, if it be fitting, and propoſed to all Chriſtendome; then is the true time of calling a General Council, and not to let the people contend by allegations of Scripture.</hi> We are now ſtep by ſtep ſoberly mounted to the Soveraign Authority of the Church in a Repreſentative. Anſ. 1. What needs all this trouble if he be as infallible as St. <hi>Peter?</hi> and why do they ſay that St. <hi>Paul</hi> went to St. <hi>Peter</hi> to confirm his Doctrine by St. <hi>Peters</hi> Authority, ſhould there not have been a Council called then as well? According to them St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> infallibility confirmed St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine: the Pope
<pb n="950" facs="tcp:40740:430"/> according to them is Succeſſour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to all effects and purpoſes as Ruler of the Church, therefore he may do it, and <hi>fruſtra fit per plures</hi> alſo. 2. Note we here that it is to be the true time of calling a Council upon debate of a point heretical, which reſpects Articles of Faith: but we have been often told by our Adverſaries that we are to have an infallible Judge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all controverſies emergent. Now if there be not a Council to be called but for deciſion of Articles of Faith; as to their's we have leſſe need, ſince he that is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. And therefore he needed not to foreclude the peoples contending in alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Scriptures; for ſurely Scripture may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged without contention, and if it happens, <hi>ſapiens non curat de accidentalibus.</hi> And ſo alſo the Council may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in allegation of Scripture; and therefore they ſhould not alleage Scripture. Yea alſo we may ſoberly contend that in articles of Faith there needs not be any other contention, ſince they are more plainly delivered in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than that we muſt ſtay for a General Council to be eſtabliſhed in the belief of them. Bleſſed be God, we are better provided for in articles of Faith, than to ſtand in ſuch neceſſity of a General Council; which when ſuch will be, and how we ſhall know it is ſuch (according to them) we muſt know by another General Council, and that by another, and ſo in <hi>infinitum:</hi> ſince we know nothing infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly but by the infallible authority of the Church; and that in a General Council. We will then take that for our Law, whereby the Council muſt Judge, ſince the matters are plain which are great: and about other things ſmall, the Judges will not meet. <hi>Lex non curat de mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</hi>

            <p>But it ſeems it is a book caſe: and example we have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the practice of the Apoſtles in the 15. of the Acts; <hi>Though the Apoſtles were all infallible in their doctrine, yet they
<pb n="951" facs="tcp:40740:430"/> could not determin that grave queſtion without calling a Council.</hi> Anſ. firſt, if thoſe termes [could not] attend an abſolute negation of power, they are denied. For they that were infallible in their doctrine could have ſeverally determined that controverſie, as we take power abſolutely, as well as St. <hi>Peter</hi> confirmed St. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, according to them. But he ſeemes to mean it in a qualified ſenſe after the manner of <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſtinction of neceſſity: therefore thus he, <hi>for this is neceſſary for the better conviction of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes; fuller ſatiſfaction of the weaker ſort, and further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the whole Church.</hi> This end of calling a Council upon ſuch a neceſſity, I ſuppoſe he reflects to the Council of the Apoſtles; as if the ſenſe ſhould be they <hi>could not</hi> conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently and upon the ſuppoſition of ſuch ends, <hi>determine that grave queſtion without calling a Council:</hi> but then we are not under an abſolute neceſſity of a Council. And untill this be proved, my adverſaries have done nothing: for a neceſſity of convenience of a Council will not ſerve their purpoſe becauſe we can grant it. But 2. we ſay this example is not for his turn; becauſe this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was called upon a queſtion about things in their nature not neceſſary: but we are upon the debate of the abſolute neceſſity of councils in and for things neceſſary, not things of ſcandall only, and yet again; 3. As it is commonly noted they in their Councils cannot conclude their determinations as in that Council of the Apoſtles <hi>(it hath ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi> becauſe thoſe Apoſtles were infallible in their diſcourſe as well a in their concluſions; but thoſe who are now members of Councils, are confeſſed by <hi>ſtaple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to be fallible in their diſcourſe and how then ſhall we be ſure that they are infallible in the concluſion, unles they can prove that though the diſcourſe be not rationall, the concluſion will yet be propheticall. And yet 4. The Apoſtles themſelves proceeded to the determination of this queſtion by principles of Scripture: therefore Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the higheſt principle to raiſe faith even in things
<pb n="952" facs="tcp:40740:431"/> of controverſie. And this concludes againſt them who make the Church in buſineſſes of faith to be the higheſt principle. And therefore alſo whatſoever binds the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith hath its obligation by vertue of Scripture. So then nothing he ſaies doth ſufficiently render that ſenſe or uſe he makes of that Text, <hi>Dic eccleſiae.</hi> And yet he hath not then found (though he does Thraſonically ſay ſo) <hi>a Iudge in matters of faith, a living Iudge, an infallible Iudge excluding all poſſibility of errour.</hi> We can helpe them to finde Judges <hi>dicendo pluraliter:</hi> but ſuch a Judge as he ſpeaks of here, he hath no more hope to find then need to ſeek. And yet ſuch a Judge he muſt have for the juſtification of Chriſt's law in the former Text, <hi>otherwiſe Chriſt could not poſſibly have declared it to be ſo haynous a crime not to hear the Church being that it might have been no crime at all: he obliged all to obey and hear her, therefore ſhe cannot lead us into an errour.</hi> Anſ. I think we ſhould not have had ſo many words about ſuch aſſent if they had not more need thereof then the Text, or Chriſt of their defence; they have more neceſſity of Chriſts juſtification then he of theirs. His words above have two formes, one in an hypotheticall way, the other in way of an Enthymem; I deny the conſequence in both; and to them both I ſuppoſe one propoſition, and that is this, Chriſts command to obey doth not inferre impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of errour in the Church. Simply it is therefore falſe what he would have to be conſequentiall. To hear the Church therefore hath two things in it; one act which is internall, and that is to give aſſent to what the Church ſhall order; the other an externall act of ſubmiſſion, the former may be denied, and therefore ſhe may erre, the latter may be due and therefore not to be denied.</p>
            <p>And conſequently his <hi>infallibility of knowledge of this point is not ſo grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as of thoſe points which are delivered by Scripture,</hi> namely not underſtanding it <hi>de facto;</hi> becauſe his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of points delivered by Scripture is, <hi>de induſtria,</hi> ſmall; but <hi>de poſſe,</hi> his knowledge of points of faith delivered by
<pb n="953" facs="tcp:40740:431"/> Scripture may be greater then his knowledg of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not delivered by Scripture.</p>
            <p>So that for his Creed, I ſay as the Frenchmen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially are wont, <hi>il ne point damne qui ne le coit,</hi> he is not damned that doth not believe it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is difference betwixt ſtanding <hi>up</hi> to what is propoſed, and ſtanding <hi>out againſt</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> in contempt. Abſolute belief will then be rational, when moral aſſurance, which yet is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be had, makes Faith.</p>
            <p>And when he hath proved the aſſumption, that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>only</hi> this Church, <hi>and by manifeſt conſequence:</hi> then the Pope ſhall be no uſurper; and yet not <hi>infallible</hi> neither. We deny the Poſtulate with a contradiction becauſe we can deny the Church's definition without a contradiction.</p>
            <p>Then in the ſeventh and eight numbers he uſeth plain-evaſions. In the ſeventh he tells me that he doth not uſe that method which I tell him he ſhould have uſed, in ſome favor to me, when I come <hi>to uſe this very method, I do foreſee that it will ſo galde you,</hi> and he ſaies, I would have the <hi>burthen</hi> ſhifted off to the <hi>other ſhoulder to avoide preſent trouble.</hi> Anſ. theſe are his Rhodomontadoes. Is not the method a <hi>priori</hi> more rationall?

There was nothing ſaid by him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly which I have not fully anſwered; and now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcements, but it became him to ſay ſo, who was more pinched.

            <p>And as quick diſpatch the ninth Paragr. deſerves. For he doth not offer any anſwer to any reaſon in mine, but here ſnaps in order to a vindication of the Text <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.7. for his cauſe. He took exceptions at our tranſlation <hi>ſhould keep knowledge,</hi> he renders it <hi>ſhall keep.</hi> I defended the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation by the poſſibility of that ſenſe in the Hebrew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no formal ſubjunctive: By the ſcope of the Text, becauſe they are blamed for their default. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts againſt our tranſlation, <hi>becauſe all originals</hi> (he means all copies; or indeed all tranſlations he ſhould mean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of what follows) <hi>ſpeak clearly in the future as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew doth: and alſo the Greek and the Latin, which two want not the Subjunctive Mood.</hi> Anſ. But firſt he ſuppoſeth that which is in queſtion that the Hebrew is to be underſtood as in the future. Secondly other tranſlations with him are fallible, ſave only the Latin; therefore the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not. Thirdly the tranſlations may be underſtood in compliance with the Hebrew, which is frequent alſo in the New Teſtament, with the Greek: and therefore if the Hebrew may be ſo conſtrued, ſo may the others by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm. Therefore if our Engliſh tranſlation were faulty herein, yet muſt it be otherwiſe convinced of a fault in this: Eſpecially ſince Fourthly, We give good reaſon why it ſhould thus be conſtrued, namely by the Scope; <hi>Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia dicti ſumitur ex ſcopo loquendi.</hi> And therefore may we well with <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> hold our Engliſh, which in general, whatſoever he ſaies of it from ſome of our own, hath not ſo many faults in it, as <hi>Iſidor Clarius</hi> found in their Latin, 8000.</p>
            <p>I asked him, is this Text meant of the Prieſts of <hi>Rome.</hi> He ſaies, <hi>I told you it was not.</hi> But why then ſhould the other Text about the Scribes and Phariſees by proportion prove their infallibility? and not this, ſince we have here the Prieſt in a ſingularity, if not <hi>ſignanter?</hi> Well then by his own conſent, this Text is not ſufficient for him: for it concerns private Prieſts; and they are as fallible as <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               <pb n="955" facs="tcp:40740:432"/> Onely the private Prieſts may know the ſenſe of the Church better, then the ſenſe of Scripture by the tranſlations, as he ſpeaks in more words to no more purpoſe. Anſ. Firſt when we have the ſenſe of the Church, are we ſure that that ſenſe is true? though it be the true ſenſe of the Church, is the ſenſe of the Church true? this is yet in queſtion. There is no queſtion but the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is true, whether the ſenſe of the Church is true is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Secondly, Let the plain places of Scripture in things neceſſary be compared with the difficulties in the Interpretation of the Trental Definitions; and then let them judge whether we had not better ſtand to Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are made by a Nation or approved, or elſe to the opinion of private Prieſts, for though <hi>her Doctrine be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully publiſhed amongſt all intelligent men:</hi> yet this is to be underſtood materially in the words, not formally in the ſenſe. And ſo the Scripture is publiſhed amongſt all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent men, in the former way, And if the people be not intelligent men too, how ſhall they know whether the true ſenſe of the Doctrine of the Church be communicated to them by learned men?</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Prieſts of the old Law</hi> were to direct the people, which were not <hi>to be directed by their own reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And the <hi>Prieſts of the new Law doubtleſs excel thoſe of the old Law.</hi> This in the ſubſtance of it we have had before, and have taken away the grounds thereof. And beſides it is falſe that the people were not to be directed by their own reading the Scriptures. What ſaith St. <hi>Luke</hi> of the <hi>Bereans?</hi> If they examined by the Scriptures what Doctrine St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught, were not they to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own readings of the Scripture. And why did the Jews apply their children to the Law from five years of age? And why did St. <hi>Paul</hi> take notice of <hi>Timothy</hi> to be trained up in the Scriptures from his childhood? and why is the man ſaid to be bleſſed, who amongſt other things, meditates in the Law day and night? Is this to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="956" facs="tcp:40740:433"/> onely of the Prieſts. 2. Therefore though they went to the Prieſts in doubtful caſes; yet not for ordinary knowledg in things neceſſary; therefore this is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>ad idem</hi> to our caſe. Thirdly, the Prieſts were bound to direct the people by the Law, were they not? To the Law and to the Teſtimonies. And not by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So are the Prieſts of the new Law, (as he calls them) to direct the people by the Scripture, not by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or determinations of the Church, unleſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture.</p>
            <p>Therefore his <hi>queſtion</hi> of the caſe <hi>in a matter of doubt,</hi> which he compares his proceeding in with the old way of the Jews, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. comes not home to our buſineſs, and therefore we may ſend it home again; and yet not for fear of not being able to anſwer what he is not willing to urge, that when in the upſhot, the queſtion ſhould be drawn up to the High Prieſt, <hi>he who would not hear him was deſervedly put to death, Deut.</hi> 17. He leaves this for us to take down our ſelves; he will not apply it, and herein he does diſcreetly fearing it may be, leaſt it ſhould be ſaid that that which he would ſeem to have referred to the High Prieſt for final judgment, ſhould indeed be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Judge contradiſtinctly ſpoken of; and by the Syriack diſjunctively to the Prieſts and Levits. And 2. I hope the High Prieſt at <hi>Rome</hi> doth not undertake a ſentence in cauſes of blood. And thirdly in that caſe there was contempt, <hi>thou ſhalt take away the evil,</hi> it is not ſaid errour, and <hi>analogum per ſe poſitum ſtat pro famoſiori ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logato,</hi> and alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 12. this is intimated, <hi>that man that will do preſumptuouſly.</hi> Fourthly, Suppoſe it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the High Prieſt for ſentence final; this might be extraordinary in a Typical reſpect to Chriſt. And they know the rule, <hi>Extraordinaria non trahuntur in regulam:</hi> We cannot make a rule of extraordinaries. And yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was not the High Prieſt, <hi>quatenus talis,</hi> Infallible; as appears in the condemnation of Chriſt, as I told them.</p>
            <pb n="957" facs="tcp:40740:433"/>
            <p>Now he would diſtinguiſh by ſaying, <hi>The Jewiſh Church erred not. The true High Prieſt (without whom there is no true repreſentative Church) erred not:</hi> Cajaphas <hi>was not the true High Prieſt, the other true High Prieſt was Chriſt.</hi> Prety ſport. So the Roman Church never erreth, becauſe Chriſt is the true Head: but then the Pope ſhould not be true High Prieſt, nor true Head: for ſo <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and he muſt be compared, in relation to Chriſt. May we not almoſt think that our Adverſary is within a little put to his ſhifts? For Chriſt was in being, I hope, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf the <hi>true Meſſias,</hi> and yet he ſaid, "the Scribes and Phariſees ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair; then we are bound to do all whatſoever is ſaid to us, without a true High Prieſt. 2. How many Popes were not true Popes, and ſo not true High Prieſts: and then when ſhall we be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether we have a true High Prieſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a true Church, and conſequently that it cannot erre? For as abſolute infallibility hath it ſelf to particular Faith in any point, according to Mr. <hi>Knot:</hi> So abſolute certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a true Pope hath it ſelf to our knowledg whether it cannot erre. Well, but he hath told us that he is the true <hi>Pope</hi> whom the Church ſhall accept: So before, but then <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was the true High Prieſt, becauſe he was accepted by the Jews. 2. Without a true <hi>Pope</hi> the Church might erre; and ſo erre in the choice of a true <hi>Pope:</hi> and then we are never a whit the nearer. And then, Thirdly, Chriſt was not the true High Prieſt, becauſe he was not accepted by the Jews, but condemned. And then again, as well the Council might be infallible without a true High Prieſt, as a General Council, ſince without any <hi>Pope</hi> or Head thereof: but the four General Councils they will ſay are infallible: and yet we ſay there was no Pope then in their ſenſe. Therefore the <hi>Council of Arimnium,</hi> which he ſpeaks of here was not fallible upon that account, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it was not confirmed by the Pope; for the other Councils were not confirmed by a Pope neither;
<pb n="958" facs="tcp:40740:434"/> there being then none. And if the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> did themſelves chuſe a Pope, then he was accepted by them; and ſo he was the true Pope, as before.</p>
            <p>He ſaies then, <hi>This true High Prieſt</hi> (namely Chriſt) <hi>erred not: the true Head of the Church not erring, the Church cannot be ſaid to erre. —iterum Criſpinus.</hi> This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Was Chriſt an external Head in the policy of the Church? If ſo, my Adverſary and the Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians might joyn Principles for their Government. And upon this account the Pope ſhould not be ſtiled onely the Vicar of Chriſt, and Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo the Succeſſor of Chriſt, the Sea being void by Chriſts promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. If Chriſt be the true Head of the Church, then the Pope is the falſe Head; unleſs the Pope and Chriſt be all one; or let them diſtinguiſh that Chriſt is a true Head in one ſenſe, namely the vital and ſpiritual Head, the Pope onely the Miniſterial Head; and if they thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, then though the vital Head doth not erre, the Miniſterial Head may erre. Thirdly, Chriſt as the true Head of his Church hath relation to the Church inviſible: but we have now to do with the Church as viſible, and upon this conſideration the promiſes which are made in Chriſt and by Chriſt to the Church as St. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. and elſewhere, ſhould not be made to the Church virtual, or to the Church Repreſentative, but inviſible unto which properly he hath relation, as Head. And thus we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the promiſes made to the Church againſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, are true; namely againſt errour damnative. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If they cloſely intend this which is ſaid in ſervice to the Roman Church ſo farre, that it cannot erre, becauſe Chriſt is the Head; then what Chriſt doth the Pope muſt do, and what the Pope doth Chriſt muſt do: but ſurely Chriſt did whip the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, ſo doth not the Pope do: and Chriſt inſtituted his Supper in both kinds, ſo doth not the Pope: and then if what the Pope does, the ſame, Chriſt ſhould be ſaid to
<pb n="959" facs="tcp:40740:434"/> do, Chriſt ſhould contradict himſelf; for by himſelf he inſtituted it in both kindes, by the Pope in one, and alſo Chriſt in Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> did ſubſcribe againſt his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Laſtly there might have been another true Head Miniſterial in the Church without prejudice to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; might there not? If not, farewell Pope and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; If ſo, then his anſwer is none, that Chriſt was then <hi>the true Head of the Church:</hi> for ſo neither <hi>Caiaphas</hi> nor any other ſhould have been High Prieſt.</p>
            <p>That of St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was touched even now, and it is good ſtill, if Councils be infallible; ſince the reaſon, why that of <hi>Ariminum</hi> ſhould not be good, is not good; and therefore that might be as infallible with eight hundred Biſhops, as the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> with fewer; ſince alſo according to my Adverſary, Chriſt is the true Head of his Church, and therefore no matter whether there was any Miniſterial Head or not, to confirm it.</p>
            <p>And as for exceptions againſt our Engliſh Tranſlation again from ſome of our own, we need ſay no more; for we did not hold the Tranſlation infallible. As he ſaid of a Chriſtian that he is <hi>mundu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; mundandus,</hi> cleare and yet to be cleanſed; ſo may it be ſaid of the Tranſlation; it was good and yet might be mended; and hath ſince, ſince their exceptions. But 2. If they will argue from imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in one place to a corruption in the whole, it is a fallacy, <hi>a dicto ſecundum quid:</hi> but ſimply it will redound, if they might ſo argue, to the undoing of the infallibility of the Latin, and purity too. And then if he takes aim againſt our Engliſh by the Interpretation of that of <hi>Malachi,</hi> or the Tranſlation rather, they beſpeak a falſity in the charge, for there was good reaſon by the connexion for that Reddition.</p>
            <p>Here we have little but a rhapſody of repetitions of former grounds, which being ſhowed to be rotten, he can ſolidly build nothing.</p>
            <p>His firſt and principal ground here is that the Church
<pb n="960" facs="tcp:40740:435"/> cannot erre; and this yet is the main queſtion: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his compare betwixt the Prieſts declaring the Law of the Church, and our Miniſters declaring the Law of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the Originals is not well grounded. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ground is not made good. Secondly, becauſe we do not urge infallibility by the Miniſters, as they muſt. And thirdly, becauſe though their Prieſts ſhould infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly conveigh the Doctrine of the Church; yet the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church may be fallible: ſo is not Scripture in the Original. And what he ſaith concerning <hi>moſt corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tranſlations</hi> hath been formerly anſwered in compare with their Latin; which they pretend infallible and is not, and therefore their Church is not infallible: but we pretend not tranſlations infallible, though better then, theirs is now. <hi>That we are not aſſured of true Scripture</hi> and if ſo, <hi>yet not of the true ſenſe,</hi> hath been anſwered; as to things neceſſary: and more aſſured then they by their Church. <hi>That many neceſſary controverſies are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in Scripture,</hi> hath been refelled and returned to them with uſe. We have ſhewed that they have no reaſon to <hi>take away from the people the uſe of Scripture. That Chaos of Corruptions</hi> in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> is more eaſily denied then proved; and the recrimination to Latin is more eaſiely proved then denied</p>
            <p>And as for the taking of the law from the mouth of the Prieſt to be as ſecure, as to take the <hi>Signification of a word in Scripture from the publique conſent of all men,</hi> they may know, if they have no more for faith, they have no faith Divine; as the effect cannot exceed the cauſe, ſo the aſſent cannot exceed the ground thereof. <hi>Aqua tantum aſcendit quantum deſcendit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their permiſſion of Scripture is in that language which the people doth not underſtand, and this is not then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them Scripture, which is, as he ſaies, <hi>knowen to moſt and bred men in Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he hath no reaſon ſurely to ſpeak of <hi>vulgar Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
               <pb n="961" facs="tcp:40740:435"/> for ſurely theirs is the vulgar Latin; though Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtned by the <hi>Trent</hi> Council; and never a whit the better for that.</p>
            <p>And I hope his <hi>locall Praelats</hi> will not allow the uſe of Tranſlations but to them whom they are <hi>ſecure</hi> of not to change their Religion, which is as much much as to blinde them, and then to give them leave to ſee. <hi>Further uſe of Scripture</hi> is not an <hi>abuſe,</hi> unles the Antient Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the people in the reading of Scriptures to an abuſe; and he was much miſtaken in the ſaying that we <hi>ſee the ſad effects of it,</hi> it is a fallacy of accident.</p>
            <p>Our Miniſters are as <hi>rightly ordained and canonically licenced to Preach,</hi> as their Prieſts to ſay Maſſe; and more too, unleſs they could prove that office better. And yet a ſimple contradiction is alſo better than a ſimple nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon our word</hi> the people may <hi>rely</hi> as well as their people upon the Prieſts, and ſomewhat more upon the former conſiderations of an impoſſibility of Faith in the truth of their being Prieſts. And yet our Miniſters are not maſters of their Faith, but helpers of their joy; as the Apoſtle ſaies of himſelf alſo, the people do not ſimply rely upon them, but believe by them.</p>
            <p>And then he comes to the occaſion of this debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, namely becauſe that Noble Perſon carped <hi>at our blind obeying our Prieſts, and believing them, whereas</hi> all of our Religion <hi>could go to the fountain.</hi> Anſ. Whether the words of that Noble Perſon were ſuch as he expreſſeth them I cannot ſay, but taking the Tranſlation to be ſo far Scripture, as that it agrees with the Original, ſo far are they the Fountain, not in language, but inſenſe. And ſo they go to the Fountain oppoſitely to the Doctrine of the Church, though not as oppoſitly to Tranſlations. And as for that which was ſaid by that Noble Perſon of <hi>blind obeying,</hi> is not here denied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we know that this blind obedience is commended by the Jeſuite for the right
<pb n="962" facs="tcp:40740:436"/> and Chriſtian obedience. And their implicit Faith muſt be blind obedience upon two accounts, Firſt becauſe they ought not to examin whether what the Prieſts ſay to them doth agree with the Doctrine of the Church; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they cannot examine it.</p>
            <p>But he excepts againſt that Fountain, <hi>but alas! when that fountain which they conceive themſelves to drink to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal health, is ſo poiſoned, as I ſhewed in my laſt Ch. that millions of millions (as your own</hi> Broughton <hi>ſaith) run to hell flames by occaſion of this corruption.</hi> Good words. He could not certainly ſay ſo unleſs he hath it from a Pope and Council. And doth he take a paſſionate <hi>Hugh</hi> to be as credible with him as Cardinal <hi>Hugh.</hi> And I think alſo the main thing for which <hi>Hugh Broughton</hi> was offended with our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was about the deſcent into Hell; which by the <hi>Trent</hi> Council ſhould ſeem not to be ſo neceſſary: for they make no mention of it in their Creed. And alſo if the ſentence proceeds ſufficiently upon <hi>Hughs</hi> words, then their Latin is poyſoned more, as it ſhould ſeem more by <hi>Iſidor Clarius,</hi> one of theirs. And my Adverſary might have remembred that we might as well ſlight <hi>Hugh Broughton</hi> in a ſingularity; as he did <hi>Iſidor Clarius.</hi> And it ſeems, the danger by Tranſlations is not ſo great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaies, <hi>I may moſt truly ſay that far more periſh by miſunderſtanding (whilſt they follow their Miniſters and their own private judgement of diſcretion) that which is truly Tranſlated, then periſh by the corruption of that which is falſely Tranſlated.</hi> Anſ. This comes looſely from him alſo. If it were obſcure, the Tranſlation might miſs, if not, how could they be in danger of periſhing? If they follow their Miniſters or their own judgement without weighing the Scriptures, they may erre as the Romaniſt does by blind obedience: But if they compare the Doctrine of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with that of Scripture by their judgment of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did that which was ſpoken by St <hi>Paul</hi> (and as he would have them compare the Doctrine of our
<pb n="963" facs="tcp:40740:436"/> Miniſters with the Authority of their Church by their judgment of diſcretion) they are in no ſuch peril of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That which is not known without great difficulty may be unknown without great danger. Otherwiſe we make God, they may think, an hard Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus they periſh for not hearing that Church which their own Scripture bids them hear, whereas in doing that which God bids, there can be no danger of errour great or ſmall</hi> Anſ. My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is very importunate, without new Arguments. If he means that the Scripture bids us hear the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, as to Faith, he begs the queſtion. If to hear, as in point of treſpaſs, or ſo as not to contemn, he fights with his own ſhadow, as being ignorant of the Elench. And ſo of the other clauſe, if he means it ſo that God bids us abſolutely do as the Church bids us, there is the ſame fault in the diſcourſe. Better may we return it to them. They periſh becauſe they will not hear the Scripture, which the Scripture and the ancient Church bids them hear, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in following Scripture <hi>there can be no danger of errour great or ſmall:</hi> and ſince alſo the Church can have no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Authority but from the Scripture: (neither hath he proved the contrary whatſoever he ſaies) and therefore he does well now to tell us that the Scripture bids us hear the Church.</p>
            <p>He ſaies, <hi>the doctrine of the Church is Gods Law.</hi> Anſ. This is a kind of cryptical propoſition. I am ſure Gods Law ſhould be the doctrine of the Church: but he means it for his uſe, whatſoever the Church reacheth is Gods Law. What? <hi>is Gods Law</hi> in <hi>recto.</hi> He ſpeaks as boldly, as if being but yet a private man he could not ſpeak under infallibility. So then we need not look any further for Gods Law, and the Scripture then will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inſufficient for our direction to heaven, as they ſay; but not neceſſary, which ſometimes they will grant. It will not be neceſſary neither as a rule, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; nor as a commonitory. And we may wonder,
<pb n="964" facs="tcp:40740:437"/> why amongſt their Counſails they did not reckon this for one, namely to uſe Scripture; ſince upon this account we are not bound to it under peril of damnation; but onely they will not allow it ſuch perfection, as to Counſails. But then if the Church bids us not, to read Scripture; or bids us, not to read Scripture, it is not Gods Law, and it is Gods Law, but it is Gods Law that we ſhould look into Scripture. To the Law and to the Teſtimony. Search the Scriptures ſaith Chriſt. If the Church teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we muſt worſhip Images or buy Images, it muſt be Gods Law againſt Gods Law of the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. If the Church bids us communicate under one kind, it muſt be Chriſts Law againſt Chriſts Law. And ſo God muſt contradict himſelf: and Scripture muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſenſe of the Church; as one of them is ſaid to have ſaid, what a cauſe have they which hath need of ſo deſperate propoſitions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And private Prieſts are farr more likely to teach them Gods Law, by teaching them what the univerſal Church holds to be Gods Law, than by teaching them what they themſelves conceive to be Gods law, as you would have them do.</hi> Anſ. This doth not contradict: If they ſay it is more likely, we can ſay it. But what is this to Faith? And upon this condition they are undone. For which of their private Prieſts are able to ſay poſitively that this is the doctrine of the whole Church for all ages and places ſince the Apoſtles? The Church otherwiſe conſidered hath no conſiderable Authority: and ſo we mean the <hi>univerſal Church.</hi> Secondly, Although thus the Church is not the <hi>regula regulans,</hi> but the <hi>regula regulata;</hi> yet they cannot bring the conſent of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church for the points of difference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad num.</hi> 11. 12. 13. 14. Herein he gives me many words towards aſſerting Tradition to be a ſufficient bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of faith; but in all theſe how little he takes away of my anſwer, any one may ſay better then I.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the eleventh, he goes upon a falſe
<pb n="965" facs="tcp:40740:437"/> ſuppoſition, that in the times before <hi>Moſes</hi> the traditions were received by the Church <hi>upon the infallibility of the Church.</hi> They were received by the Church, not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the Church. The Church had it ſelf herein as a mean of propoſall, not as the laſt motive of faith. Their faith was terminated by the ſpirit of God in the matter of tradition; was not determined by the Church's Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive delivery: the <hi>objectum quod</hi> of their faith was not the Churches propoſal. Then 2. ſuppoſing what we do not grant, yet there is not now the ſame reaſon for the Church: becauſe they had more appearances t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en of God to and in the Church, then now there is or hath been ſince the Apoſtles times. And therefore the rule is good, <hi>Diſtingue tempora.</hi> 3. This will make a circle. How were they aſſured infallibly of tradition by the Church? How were they infallibly aſſured of the Church by tradition? then the reſolution of their faith was not into the credit of the Church as infallible. Therefore doth my Antagoniſt in vain ſay to me, <hi>ſhew the ground they had there to hold the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi> Nay the proofe hereof muſt come from the affirmer: <hi>Aſſerentis eſt probare.</hi> They are to make good here two things firſt, that they did hold their Church infallible; otherwiſe how could any of the people hold it to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; unles the Church did ſo determin of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſelfe? and then that though they did hold it to be infallible, yet that it was ſo and muſt be ſo, otherwiſe they could not believe anything.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he makes a per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>triction of my diſtinction, <hi>that the word in ſubſtance of it was before the Church, which was begotten by it:</hi> and then he tells me what I adde thereunto, <hi>that when there is as much need, and as great a certainty of tradition as formerly,</hi> then he may urge the argument. Here he ſhifts and ſhuffles. He tell me that I muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the <hi>unwritten word</hi> and to be only <hi>in orall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> Right I underſtand it ſo. But what is this to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> queſtion; whether the manner of conveyance by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in way of orall tradition was infallible; and then whether we
<pb n="966" facs="tcp:40740:438"/> are bound to take all or part of neceſſary doctrine from the Church this way. And can they now conclude the Church infallible in the matter of tradition beſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide the word written, by their tradition of the word unwritten? And can they ſhew that the <hi>Iews</hi> were equally bound to any Tradition before the word written, which was not agreable to the word afterwards written? Otherwiſe how can they ſupply this to their purpoſe in urging Traditions differing from Scripture in matter equally to Scripture; as the <hi>Trent</hi> Council defines, as before? Let them come to the point; and ſatisfie demands.</p>
            <p>In his diſcourſe following I can grant him all untill he come to this, <hi>they only had Gods word revealed by tradition.</hi> This we muſt debate upon as being ambiguouſly delivered: for [only] may relate to the ſubject [they] and ſo the ſenſe is, the <hi>Iewes</hi> only had Gods word revealed by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but this is concerned here; or [only] may have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to [Gods word] as to the matter which was revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſo the ſenſe is, that they had only that word which was revealed by tradition; and this comes not to the point neither, or <hi>only</hi> may relate to the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing by tradition, and thus indeed it is proper for the debate, but thus it is denied; if we take it thus, that the word of God was no otherwiſe aſſured to them than by tradition, though they onely being Jews had onely that word of God which was revealed by tradition, to believe; yet had they not only tradition, by which they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. And therefore his concluſion muſt be naught; and all he ſaies to that purpoſe, even to the end of his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
            <p>In the twelfth he deales about the need of tradition, and he ſaies <hi>that the need or neceſſity of Tradition which you conceive to have been greater then than now, doth not make the Traditions more Credible.</hi> Anſ. True it is, that ſimply the need of them doth not make them to be more credible, if they be to be believed: but there is the queſtion whether there is now
<pb n="967" facs="tcp:40740:438"/> any to be believed neceſſarily, in point of faith, when there is not ſuch need of them. Scripture is as credible when we are heaven, in regard of it ſelf; yet there we have no need of it: but as ſince we have no need of it there, we have reaſon to believe that there it will not take place; ſo neither ſhould Traditions, when there is not that need of them. My anſwer then did bear it ſelf upon this, that if there were that neceſſity of Tradition now as then, he might urge the argument, becauſe God have would provided ſufficiently for ſecurity of tradition now as then: <hi>falſum prius.</hi> And we may take his own ſimilitude, thoſe that have read <hi>many credible books of France,</hi> have they any need of <hi>orall Tradition,</hi> to believe that there is ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as France? he ſaies no: yet theſe laſt are as certain, he ſaies. Well then, no more need have we of tradition for the doctrine of Chriſt which we ſufficiently read in Scripture. So then, although he concludes Traditions hopefull (and <hi>ſuperflua non nocent</hi>) yet can he not conclude them as neceſſary; which ſhould have been demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>But this he would doe in following words, <hi>even now when we have Scriptures and Traditions, we have ever had with them a perpetual ſucceſſion of horrible Diviſions opening ſtill wider and wider.</hi> Again odd reflexions upon Scripture: but it is well he jopnes Traditions with it to take part of the conſequence, as he thinks: and yet it may be he does not think ſo; but that the cauſe of the <hi>Diviſions</hi> is only Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and had we had no Scriptures, we ſhould have had fewer Diviſions. Doth he think ſo? Then how is Scripture neceſſary, as they generally confeſſe, when it had been convenient that there had been no Scripture, upon this conſideration? And how ſhould they prove the Authority of the Church without Scripture? Well, but take his words in their ordinary ſenſe, and what kinde of argument will this be. <hi>Even now when we have Scripture and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> therefore now Traditions are now as neceſſary or
<pb n="968" facs="tcp:40740:439"/> more then when there was no Scripture? Nay they will ſeem to be leſs neceſſary, when notwithſtanding them, we have more diviſions. How then ſhall theſe diviſions be remedied? It may be by more traditions. What? New traditions? <hi>oppoſitum in appoſito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the next words he ſpeaks out <hi>All</hi> (diviſions) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cauſed by miſinterpretation of the Scriptures, to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience they were not ſubject, before all Scripture was written. And therefore in this reſpect there is now after the writing of the Scriptures, a greater neceſſity then ever of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Anſ. So then, he hath now commented upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words, and his ſenſe is plain that had we not had Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ſhould have had leſs need of Traditions. Firſt, we had thought the Learned men of their Church had deviſed Traditions, not becauſe we had Scripture, but becauſe Scripture was wanting in the matter of neceſſary doctrine. And ſo he himſelf telles us preſently after, that ſince <hi>part of the Canon is loſt,</hi> we muſt ſay there is uſe of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. And yet now we have more need of Traditions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Scripture is written. But, it may be, he will ſay there is more need of Traditions to clear the interpretations of Scripture. Yea, but then he ſhould mean by <hi>Traditions</hi> Traditive interpretations of Scripture, as they are called. But are not theſe loſt too? For who is there can give us any account of them? And as for other Traditions we are never a whit the better he hath told us before; ſince notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we have them, we have a <hi>perpetuall ſucceſſion of horrible diviſions opening ſtill wider &amp; wider.</hi> Let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lus,</hi> to accuſe Scripture is to accuſe God. 2. Are the diviſions neceſſary in points neceſſary? If he means ſo, it is flatly denied. If in other points, it is not to the queſtion principal. 3. <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia:</hi> if we be bound to Tradition, as ſuch; we are bound to all; and yet all Traditions they have not kept. 4. Traditions doe not leſſen diviſions about inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture: for one diviſion is whether Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="969" facs="tcp:40740:439"/> have any ground in Scripture. And he may know that he hath named Texts to this purpoſe, and becauſe there are differences about Traditions, therefore, by his argument, we ſhould not be ruled by them; as indeed they do not order themſelves by them. They keep Tradition in the controverſie for the uſe of the Church; not in practice, as he ſaid, <hi>Antiquitatem ſemper crepant, novi indies vivunt:</hi> and we muſt let goe the Scripture in controverſie and practice for the uſe of Tradition and the Church, they and their Fathers have troubled the waters of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the cheif Fiſher. Let them let their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alone: and they will ſee their diſcourſe is <hi>a non cauſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he repeats importunately the uſes of Traditions, but not my refutation. And he ſpeaks of Traditions of ſuch matter as we have in Scripture: which is beſide the mark, we are about Traditions in their ſenſe of that matter which is not in Scripture equally to be believed to Scripture, which ſhould prove the inſufficiency of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the neceſſity of them. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore much he ſaies to this purpoſe is like the drift of ſnow, which makes an heap, but will not bear one up from ſinking in it, Yet I muſt note his wit in that he ſaies, that <hi>God muſt purpoſely by a miracle have infringed the courſe of nature, if the former Traditions of the Church ſhould grow then to loſe their ſufficiency in order to the ſame effect, when they were ſtrengthened by ſo great an Authority as that of the ſacred writers was.</hi> How little in this is there of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſoul; As if the matter of Tradition was written by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt to confirm the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of delivering it by orall Tradition. Doth it not appear in <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſtory</hi> that the matter of the New Teſtament, was written that it might be more certain and firm in the minds of men? It ſeems then that the looſer way by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was not ſo ſure and ſtanding—<hi>litera ſcripta manet.</hi> Secondly, If there be ſo <hi>great an Authority of the ſacred
<pb n="970" facs="tcp:40740:440"/> writers,</hi> ſurely we may make more uſe of what they wrote to confirm Traditions. <hi>Adeone pudorem cum pudicitia per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderunt;</hi> as he ſaid, that the Authority of the ſacred writers ſhould be imployed as it were onely to ſerve Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Thirdly, The Authority of the ſacred Writers did rather confirm the truth of them than the uſe, for why were they written, if Traditions were neceſſary after they were written, as ſuch? Therefore fourthly, He concludes but ſufficiency of them in order to the effect: but this is not effectual to his purpoſe. If he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude neceſſity of them after the writing, this would be ſomewhat: but then there would be more in the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than is in the premiſes, and yet ſurely all were nothing to the ſtate of the queſtion; becauſe we make no queſtion of ſuch Traditions. Again he pleadeth loſſe of the <hi>Canon,</hi> upon which he thinks, Tradition ſhould <hi>revive.</hi> Anſ. That we have ſpoken of ſufficiently before; that the ſuppoſal doth not inferre inſufficiency of the Canon, and therefore doth not inferre neceſſity of Traditional matter beſide what is written. And alſo, is there yet (notwithſtanding the loſſe of ſome part of Scripture) enough remaining to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Traditions? yes, they will ſay. Then God it ſeems hath taken more care for Traditions than Salvation: there is enough for Traditions yet in Scripture; not for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Well but again, there is enough in Scripture to confirm all Traditions, is there not? If there be, then there is enough for Salvation, or elſe there was not enough in Traditions: Becauſe they will ſay Scripture hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all Traditions; to the Jew namely. And then, if there was enough to the Jew for Salvation in the Old Teſtament, which was adaequate to Tradition; then much more have we enough for Salvation by the New Teſtament: and therefore is there no need of any Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſide the Canon.</p>
            <p>Then he returns to an enarration of the uſe of Traditions even after writing; which is of no uſe to them, but to us;
<pb n="971" facs="tcp:40740:440"/> becauſe here he produceth ſeveral Texts for Traditions in the ſame notion; as 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2, 2. and herein he prevaricates in his own cauſe: For if theſe Texts be meant of ſuch Traditions which were afterwards written in the matter of them, they are ſo underſtood as we would have them to be underſtood; and they are not pertinent to the queſtion about Traditions beſide Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the matter of them. Secondly, Whereas he ſpeaks that theſe Texts confirm the <hi>certainty</hi> of Traditions; we grant it; namely of thoſe Traditions which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards written: but how do theſe Texts confirm the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain neceſſity of thoſe that are not written And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thirdly, He is mightily diſappointed if he conceives thoſe Texts ſhould bind us to ſtand upon Traditions <hi>now more than ever;</hi> for the formality of Tradition was there ſunk in the writing; and the matter of Tradition was the ſame with that which was writtten, in his own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs he drives the Texts Heterogeneouſly to his own words.</p>
            <p>And he impingeth upon the ſame ſtone again, <hi>What wiſe man would put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut one light, coſting him nothing, becauſe it will be ſhining of its own nature (unleſs you will needs have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hidden) becauſe he hath now another light, but ſo, that even with both thoſe lights many of his houſhold will ſtill remain i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> darkneſs.</hi> Anſ. He ſuppoſeth a light added to a light. It is well then that Scripture is aſſured to be one light, but his Tradition ſhould be compared to a light when there is no other light, namely when the Scripture is defective. Secondly, If he thinks Tradition is a light <hi>coſting us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> he may be deceived; for it will coſt a great deal of Scrutiny, ſince we cannot ſee it <hi>ſhining of its own nature</hi> infallibly. And thirdly, If ſome be ſtill <hi>in darkneſe with both thoſe lights,</hi> then ſurely they may be more in darkneſs with but one, and that is Tradition; therefore they ſhould allow the people the light of the Scripture, ſince both too little, as he ſaies, to ſome. But fourthly, What
<pb n="972" facs="tcp:40740:441"/> if one light put out the other in the true ſtate of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely Scripture Tradition ſuperadded in matter? And what wiſe man will light a ſtraw candle, in the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> expreſſion, when the Sun ſhines? the Sun-light of Scripture puts out the ſtraw-light of Traditions, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <q>thoſe who teach for Doctrines Traditions of men; which the Romaniſt does in ſome proportion.</q> And fifthly, what wiſe man would have ſuch a light which ſerves his turn beſt when it ſhines leaſt: for Traditions, if we believe our Adverſaries, are a covered diſh, dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be kept private for thoſe who are fit to receive them; the more wiſe and perfect men which may teach them to others. The myſtery of Salvation, that is made common by writing: but the myſtery of Tradition is put under a buſhel. The myſtery of the Trinity is delivered in Scripture; but the myſtery of the <hi>Trent</hi> Traditions muſt not be familiarly known. So then, ſay they what they will or can, we ſhall ſooner find an extinguiſher for the light of the ruſh candle, than they for the light of the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if you ſay that if Scripture had not been given us, we ſhould have had a more certain Tradition given us.</hi> So he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers my words; which were not ſo, but thus, <q>If Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not been left to us, we ſhould have had Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more certainly conveighed to us, as the Goſpel was before it was written.</q> Now ſome difference there is betwixt <hi>given us,</hi> and <hi>left us;</hi> for that which is <hi>left</hi> to us is intended for our conſtant uſe, which that which is <hi>given</hi> doth not connotate. So ſome Pontificians will ſay, the Scripture was given upon particular occaſion: but was not left to the Church as a fixed univerſal rule. But there is yet more betwixt us about my words, we ſhould have had Tradition more certainly conveighed to us; ſo I ſaid: he reports me thus, <hi>we ſhould have had a more certain Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given unto us.</hi> A more certain Tradition given, and a Tradition more certainly conveighed, are not altogether the ſame, the former ſuppoſeth the matter of Tradition
<pb n="973" facs="tcp:40740:441"/> as not certain; and this we can deny as to thoſe times when there was no Scripture, as written; the other ſpeaks <hi>de modo tradendi,</hi> which comes cloſer to our queſtion. For we can perſwade our ſelves that God who is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly provident for his Church, wherein he hath placed his Name, would have taken care that if there had not been a certain direction in writing, the matter of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrine and practice ſhould have been more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated to us.</p>
            <p>So then he thrives very little by compare of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church with the Jewiſh, although the Chriſtian Church be more <hi>noble.</hi> For firſt the compare muſt be of the Jewiſh with the whole Chriſtian Church, becauſe the Jewiſh Church (Proſelyts being included therein, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proſelyts of the Covenant, as they were diſtinguiſhed) was all the Church there was. And ſecondly, Becauſe no part of the whole Church can compare with the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church as to priviledges: and then by this reckoning how little of Nobility will fall to their ſhare? Thirdly, As the Tradition (which was it whereby the matter of Scripture was propoſed) was for the time neceſſary before the matter of Scripture was written: ſo alſo muſt the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Chriſtian Church be conſidered as in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the time before which the matter of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was written, therefore he ſhould have pleaded, if he would have it done patly, that there was any Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith after the Old Law was written, beſide what was written, which was to be believed unto Salvation equally to what was written; and then have drawn down a parallel Line of proportion of the ſame (though he would have more nobility) for the Chriſtian Church. Thirdly, If the nobleneſs of a Church be antecedent to more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tradition, as he thinks, then how happened it that there was ſo little a time betwixt the preaching of the Goſpel and the writing of it? It ſeems then, if God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for Churches according to the nobleneſs of them,
<pb n="974" facs="tcp:40740:442"/> that the better proviſion for the Church is by Scripture. The Chriſtian then hath a more certain way of Faith than by Tradition.</p>
            <p>And as for means of ſecuring Tradition in the Chriſtian Church, which he compares with the Jewiſh in, he hath no cauſe to bragg. For firſt, they cannot ſay or prove that they have all Traditions in number formal and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. Secondly, They do not practice all. How many are there which St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks of in his <hi>Tract. de Sp. Sanct.</hi> which they obſerve not. Thirdly, The ſafety of them is in the whole Church; and yet forſooth every one muſt not know them. Fourthly, If ſo, then have they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to bluſh that they have been more careful to keep Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than Scripture, and particularly of the Hebrew Copy of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and is this for their credit? Fifthly. Are the Scriptures preſerved uncorrupt or not? If not, how have they been faithful, as before. If ſo, then why do their learned men obtrude the Authentiqueneſs of their Latin upon this account, that when this Edition was made, the Scriptures were pure and uncorrupted, but corrupted ſince?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again the Tradition of Chriſt's Primitive Church before the Scripture was written and ſufficiently promulged, was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon her ſole Authority.</hi> Anſ. If he takes that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition incluſively to the Apoſtles who preached that which they did write afterwards, and take Tradition for the matter of what was written, we grant it; if but he takes <hi>tradition of the primitive Church</hi> to be that which was derived to after times, and was not written, we deny it to be believed upon her ſole Authority. In the former ſenſe it is true, but not pertinent; in the latter, pertinent, but not true. And indeed this was the notion of Traditions for the firſt times, namely to be that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>e of doctrine which did comprehend the materialls of faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be any thing different from Scripture, or diverſe (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </hi>) from
<pb n="975" facs="tcp:40740:442"/> Scripture. So he will finde <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to mean it. And ſo St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of Jeruſalem in his 5. <hi>Cat.</hi> 117. <hi>p,</hi> of the <hi>gr. laſt Ed.</hi> makes it to be upon account no other than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Syſtem out of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures about every of thoſe things conteined. And again, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for things of faith were not compoſed as it pleaſed men, but the moſt pertinent things being gathered out of all <q>Scripture do make up the doctrine of faith. And again as the ſeed of muſtard in a little grain doth contein many branches: ſo faith it ſelf in few words doth comprehend the knowledge of piety that is in the old and new Teſtament.</q> And what followes but that text which he (my adverſary named) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſee therefore Brethren and hold the Traditions. So then if he takes <hi>Tradition</hi> in the firſt ſenſe, the Church was infallible therein, by the Apoſtles: if in the ſecond, the Tradition was infallibly Scripture: and the Church believed it upon that account. And that Traditions did not bind either in their own virtue, or without Scripture, they may ſee in St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who yet ſpeaks much for them. So in the ſeventh <hi>ch.</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, where ſpeaking of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie whethre they were to ſay of the Son of God <hi>with whome or by whome,</hi> he hath theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. this is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to us that it is a Tradition of the Fathers: for even they did follow the will of Scripture, having taken principles out of teſtimonies, which a little before we propoſed to you out of Scripture. <hi>God therefore ſaid</hi> by his Apoſtles that the Traditions then were infallible, (being in matter the ſame with what they wrote) for their <hi>Authority. Now if God ſaid this, ſhall we upon his fallible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> (for even Councils are fallible in their diſcourſe) <hi>come to ſay the Church's Traditions</hi> are further infallible then agreeable to his word, <hi>though God</hi> never ſaid ſo, <hi>and
<pb n="976" facs="tcp:40740:443"/> never yet expreſſed</hi> any ſuch infallibility of the Church? And thus I return him his own words <hi>mutatis mutandis:</hi> And ſo my Argument out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is not yet refuted.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he take away my uſe of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> teſtimony in the next paragr. For as to my Argument what he ſaies is not appliable. It was thus out of his Authority, <hi>If the Scripture had not been left to us,</hi> 
               <q>we ſhould have had Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more certainly conveighed to us as the Goſpel was before it was written; but the Scripture is now left to us; therefore no need of certain conveighance of tradition to us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Syllogiſm he makes no offer of anſwer to: for that which he ſaies in a Parentheſis, <hi>(though you cannot invent the means, by which Tradition ſhould have been conveighed more certainly, ſuppoſing there had been no Scripture)</hi> I can receive without prejudice to my Argument: for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Hypothetically ſhould have been done, had not there been Scripture; yet now, ſince we have Scripture, we have no ſuch need of; we now diſpute upon the fact, not againſt the ſuppoſition. Therefore from the dint of the ratiocination he digreſſeth to an obſervation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect in me to St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> becauſe I ſaid, <q>Neither <hi>can we believe that thoſe barbarous Nations did rely onely upon Tradition.</hi>
               </q> Anſ. He is in this deceived. To aſſent to Tradition in the matter of it, and not to aſſent to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the ſole Authority of Tradition, are not ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites as he imagines; for they may well agree. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Father ſaid, they did aſſent to Tradition as to the matter; yet not by Tradition, as the manner. Tradition was the <hi>objectum materiale,</hi> not the <hi>objectum forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> of their Faith. And the next words as he alſo perhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the Fathers words, do defend my anſwer, <q>
                  <hi>having Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation written in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </q> So then they were aſſured of the Doctrine of Salvation by the Holy Ghoſt: then they did not believe that Tradition upon the ſole Authority of the Church. So this contradicts my Adverſary, and makes for me; not onely by conſequence
<pb n="977" facs="tcp:40740:443"/> becauſe it is againſt him; but directly: for then we can as well be aſſured of Scripture by the Holy Ghoſt; &amp; have no ſuch need then of the authority of the Church, as to ſalvation, though the church were infallible, which is one of the things to be proved, and cannot. And yet beſides, this tradition in the ſenſe of the Father, was in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, Scripture; and therefore hath no conſanguinity with the true ſtate of the queſtion. So then we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in the negative, they did not <hi>rely upon,</hi> or believe <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſole account of that very tradition,</hi> &amp; yet, if they had, it would not conclude againſt our cauſe, becauſe that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not the ſame with what belongs to the queſtion.</p>
            <p>To be civil to an Adverſary in this number,<note place="margin">N. 14.</note> all the ſenſe of it may be reſolved into this diſcourſe, <hi>If the radition of the Church teſtifying her own infallibility in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for Gods Word, that which ſhe delivereth for Gods word,</hi> be to be believed, then ſhe is to be believed as propoſing that to be Gods Word, <hi>which is not written.</hi> Anſ. This hath been abundantly agitated before, with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity to the Plaintiffe: but ſince he repeats, I do not. And we anſwer, Firſt, the conſequence is not clear, eſpecially if we extend it to that which is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Scripture, if he underſtands it of that which is grounded in Scripture, it is not proper to the queſtion. As to that which is not grounded in Scripture, we may ſtill deny the major. Tradition (univerſal) of the Church may be worthy of aſſent as to the truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and not ſo of that which is delivered beſide Scripture: which alſo is held by others againſt them, and the reaſon is not yet diſproved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was more neceſſity of the Faith of Scripture than that which is delivered beſide Scripture, and therefore may we well ſuppoſe a greater aſſiſtance to the propoſing of Scripture than any thing diverſe. <hi>Deus non deficit in neceſſariis.</hi> Why do they aſſert infallible aſſiſtance to General Councils, not to private Doctors, or to a National Council? Namely, becauſe others
<pb n="978" facs="tcp:40740:444"/> are to be directed by the General Councils; well then the Church univerſal might be more aſſiſted for the propoſing of Scripture than for any thing elſe. But then I deny the minor, the <hi>Tradition of the Church teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying her own infallibility is not worthy of an infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</hi> It may be worthy of the higheſt degree of moral aſſurance, yet not of an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fal ible aſſent. No Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can write, as to Conſcience, what a king writes as to civil credit, <hi>teſte me ipſo,</hi> but that which is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly divine. And why then do the Pontificians prove the Authority of the Church by Scripture. The Church without Scripture is not yet Chriſtned, if we take Scripture for the ſubſtance of the matter, it will be but the higheſt form of Heathens. And therefore the Scripture is to be believed antecedently to the Church. And how little his examples have proved the minor, we have ſeen: even as much as he had cauſe to conclude againſt me out of my own words thus, <hi>Tradition in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith unwritten is of equal Authority to Scripture. The Traditions we ſtand upon be matters of Faith truly once delivered by our Saviour or his Apoſtles, though the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not written by them, therefore this is of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Scripture even according to your own words.</hi> Surely it is eaſier to anſwer this than to forbear the Perſon. The propoſition was not my words, I hope, categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpoken, but as being the ſtate of the queſtion; if thoſe Traditions be in the matter beſide Scripture. And now he takes this to be my affirmation ſimply. And then we deny his minor too, becauſe that which they ſtand upon is not matter of Faith, as being not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by our <hi>Saviour or his Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>truly delivered</hi> by either; for they are uncertain by which. And if they will urge that Text St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the 16.22. as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> does, they may think that <hi>many things</hi> might be written afterwards, or were not points of Faith. And this Text hereticks have urged: and therefore by my
<pb n="979" facs="tcp:40740:444"/> Adverſaries Logique, he ſhould not. And did <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> think that any could ſoberly ſay that the points of difference were of that number? Or did any of the Saints in Heaven ſee what they were, <hi>in ſpeculo Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> and did ſend down word thereof?</p>
            <p>As for his defence of the exception which he took againſt the Scriptures being a ſufficient rule to us,<note place="margin">N. 15.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>neither the Apoſtles nor their Succeſſours took any care to have the Scripture communicated to all Nations in ſuch Languages as all or the greater part of them could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;</hi> my anſwer is yet good, the care was taken, in that the new Teſtament was written in Greek, which was a common language then. And this I gave an Argument of, in that the Grecian is contradiſtinguiſhed to the Jew in the New Teſtament. And therefore the Greek muſt be the greateſt and moſt famous part; and therefore the language common: this proof he is not pleaſed to meddle with at all. Another proof that that was the common Language was that of <hi>Tully</hi> for <hi>Archias</hi> the Poet, <hi>Graeca per totum orbem leguntur.</hi> This he takes notice of. And he ſaies, <hi>and ſo is Virgil in Latin.</hi> But this doth not contradict me; yea, he gives me a corroboration of my Argument: for whom did <hi>Virgil</hi> imitate? <hi>Theocritus</hi> in his <hi>Eglogues, Heſiod</hi> in his <hi>Georgicks, Homer</hi> in his <hi>Aeneids.</hi> Yea <hi>Horace</hi> had read the Greeks, it ſeems by his <hi>Greciſms.</hi> Yea <hi>Terence</hi> was ſo converſant in <hi>Menander</hi> that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Menander dimidiatus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he ſaies, This is to be underſtood thus, that the <hi>moſt learned ſort of men every where read Greek and Virgil.</hi> Anſ. This (ſuppoſed) is not excluſive to the Greeks, being the common Language; as to others; ſince he will think the Latin was common to the people then, and yet the moſt learned read <hi>Virgil.</hi> And did not all thoſe Nations whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles to, underſtand Greek? Did he write onely to the
<pb n="980" facs="tcp:40740:445"/> 
               <hi>moſt learned?</hi> In what Language was the Epiſtle to the Romans, and the Epiſtle to the Hebrews (for the Roman Church confeſſeth that this Epiſtle alſo was written by St. <hi>Paul</hi>) written? were they not both written in Greek? yea the Jews that uſed the Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint Tranſlation, were many. So <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew; and <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> the Roman, wrote in Greek. And therefore that which was ſpoken by the Oratour was ſpoken without any ſuch Hyperbole.</p>
            <p>He ſaies yet further, either this muſt be ſpoken in <hi>way of a notable amplification, or Scripture muſt be denied,</hi> becauſe even between the two Cities of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople, the Greek tongue was not the vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of</hi> Pontus, Cappadocia, Aſia <hi>minor,</hi> Phrygia, Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia; <hi>all which Nations the Scripture</hi> (Act. 2.) <hi>teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have had different Languages.</hi> Anſ. Though the Scripture ſpeaks of them as diſtinguiſhed in ſpeech, yet not in Language, but dialect; and ſo it is expreſſed <hi>ver.</hi> 6.8. And ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be reſtrained as to thoſe who had ſeveral dialects: therefore whereas he ſaies <hi>the Greek tongue was not the vulgar</hi> Language of <hi>Pontus</hi> &amp;c. If he means that the common Dialect of the Greek was not uſed by them all, this is not much to be ſtood upon, becauſe it is not reaſonable to ſay that thoſe who ſpake ſeveral Dialects did not underſtand the common Greek; for take them all, <hi>Attique, Joni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, Dorique, Aeolique,</hi> and <hi>Baeotique,</hi> they differ or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily but in terminations or pronunciation from the common.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Within that compaſs is alſo</hi> Galatia <hi>which St.</hi> Jerom <hi>teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have had a language ſomwhat like thoſe of</hi> Trevers. An. It is as farre from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens</hi> as from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes</hi> is it not? Then that of <hi>Trevers</hi> muſt be as neer that of greek as that of the <hi>Galatians</hi> which was greek, in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time. If afterwards the language altered or was corrupted, this doth not contradict us becauſe we
<pb n="981" facs="tcp:40740:445"/> muſt diſtinguiſh times. And therefore yet it remains good, that the <hi>greek was underſtood of the greater part of the world;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtles took care to have the knowledge of the Goſpel to be commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And if they had not, God did miraculouſly by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>ſub forma viſibili</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> in the gift of tongues. And this concludes againſt their <hi>Latin ſervice:</hi> as alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſeth and concludeth againſt it in the firſt <hi>Ep. Cor.</hi> 14. And though we cannot tell the time, <hi>when the Scripture can firſt be ſhewed to have been thus communicated to the people of ſeverall languages,</hi> what is this to the purpoſe? If it had not been done afterwards, it is enough to us that the Apoſtles did write in the moſt common language for thoſe times. And if it had not been done, it ſhould have been done. But that it was done, appears ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in the great Bible. Neither can they tell us, or will, when the vulgar Latin began firſt to be Authentique; whether under <hi>Sixtus Quintus, or Clement</hi> the eighth.</p>
            <p>In the beginning he tells me that I moved a queſtion <hi>how the people ſhould clearly know the true Tradition from the falſe.</hi> Anſ. I did move this queſtion: but ſomwhat elſe was annexed, which he ſaies nothing to. Well to this he now anſwers, firſt, <hi>they could know this better then know true Scripture from falſe, for they could not do that but by knowing firſt the true Tradition, recommending the true Scripture, from the falſe tradition recommending the falſe.</hi> Anſ. Firſt this hath been often denied him that the ultimate reſolution of faith in the true Scripture: is not Tradition: this may lead us to the gate of the Temple, but this does not open the doore of faith. 2. That Tradition which makes an inducement is of the univerſall, not Roman Church. 3. How ſhall we know true tradition but by the true Church? How ſhall we know the true Church but by Scripture;
<pb n="982" facs="tcp:40740:446"/> therefore we muſt know the true tradition from the falſe by the Scripture; which contradicts his method.</p>
            <p>And he ſaies, <hi>they (could do this as well</hi> (or better) <hi>than their fore-Fathers for many hundred of years, yea for two thouſand, yea for twice two thouſand years together.</hi> Anſw. Firſt they ſee then their error in defining Faith ſo ſtrictly to be an infallible aſſent: ſince they here ſtand upon a comparative certainty (if ſo) which amounts not to the conſiſtence of faith. Secondly. He ſuppoſeth that which is not to be ſuppoſed, that their fore-fathers were determined in their faith of the word of God by Tradition. Even now, or a litle before, he ſaid Tradition was eſtaliſhed to the Jew by Scripture: Now Tradition is that which muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and conſequently ſtabliſh Scripture. 3. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that as Scripture is more perfect then Tradition; becauſe otherwiſe God had gone the worſt way, namely from that which is more perfect to that which is leſs perfect, namely from Tradition to the writing of his word, but that which is leſs pefect cannot eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh that which is more perfect. Therfore neither then, nor now could Scripture receive the bleſſing of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that which is inferiour 4. In the times of the law there was no other Church to vie with the Jewes about Traditions: And therefore they might be more certain of true Traditions: But now there are ſeveral national Churches, which may pretend ſuperiority of tradition, or tradition of ſuperiority as the Roman doth: and therefore it is not ſo ſure a way to fixe our laſt foot upon Tradition. 5. Univerſal Tradition of all times and places (which only weighs in this cauſe) is not in other things for them, nor in that canon ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary of theirs; and therefore let them either retract the argument, or take it. Yet he will be confident of two Traditions, whereof the efficacie is commended <hi>with perpetuall profeſſion and anſwerable practice dayly occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
               <pb n="983" facs="tcp:40740:446"/> Baptiſm of Infants, <hi>and praier for the faithfull eparted.</hi> The firſt of theſe we have abundantly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before: and he does here moſt inſiſt upon the latter, aſſigning alſo his reaſon of more practice of this laſt. <hi>Becauſe they baptize Infants but once, but they pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ften for the ſame man who is dead.</hi> And then being more practiſed, it is more confirmed; which <hi>Creſſie</hi> alſo urgeth. Anſ. As for Paedobaptiſm here, he doth not prove it to be a Tradition, unleſs this be a true propoſition, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is commended with <hi>perpetual profeſſion and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practice daly accurring,</hi> is only delivered by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Tradition is ſuch: but all that is ſuch, is not Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore that propoſition denied. And for what he ſaies towards both before, that the Apoſtles did only by <hi>unwritten Tradition</hi> clearly and undeniably teach the baptizing of Children, <hi>and praier for the faithfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted:</hi> it is not clear that it is undeniable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clearely and undeniably it is denied. Baptiſm of Infants hath not yet loſt ſufficient ground in Scripture to keep it from a neceſſity of being named Tradition, as he ſhould have ſhewed. And as to the other, <hi>praier for the dead,</hi> we anſwer, firſt, it ſeemes then it is but a Tradition, and they will pradon us if we ſpeak thus diminutively of it. And whether this will pleaſe all the Roman Doctors, that it ſhould have no footing in Scripture, let it be none of our care 2. For the object of perſons whom they praied for, queſtion would be made, what morally, they were, who were to be praied for; but this he tells us; he ſaies they were the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> Well, but all the faithfull, I ſuppoſe. It may be they will ſay, yes. If not; let them give us a reaſon of their diſtinction, according to Tradition. If ſo, then praier for the dead doth not inferr purgatory, which they intend in the praier for the dead. And the reaſon of the conſequence is proved, becauſe praier was made for all the faithfull; and ſome of them went up
<pb n="984" facs="tcp:40740:447"/> to Heaven <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> as they will alſo confeſs, namely Apoſtles and Martyrs; and yet theſe were alſo prayed for in order to a joyful reſurection. And indeed the antient praiers for the dead did reſpect their bodies in the grave to be raiſed up at the reſurrection, not their ſoules to be raiſed out of Purgatory after a plenary ſatisfaction. And what meanes St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in Tract. <hi>In Iohannem</hi> 49. <hi>unus quiſ<expan>

Neither had the Roman Church with their infallibility perſwaded the Greek Church hereof, in <hi>Nilus's</hi> time, who hath a learned diſcourſe againſt it. And thirdly, as for <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> upon the <hi>Graves</hi> (whereby he would make a preſcription for the tradition) we ſay two things. Firſt that we muſt have them to be ſhewed to be ſo antient as to have been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally uſed in the Primitive times, and then ſecondly, that they were uſed upon the Roman account. And as for <hi>Aerius,</hi> who (onely) as he ſaies denied <hi>praying for the dead,</hi> to be <hi>accounted for this his opinion an Heretick by St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>and St.</hi> Epiphanius, they muſt ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us: for this abſolutely is not right for their turn, if true. Firſt not right for their uſe, becauſe he might deny prayers and oblations for the dead in the former reſpect, namely for a joyful reſurrection; and this comes not up to the ſtate of the point wherein we differ, namely whether prayer for the dead was a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their ſenſe, as inferring Purgatory. But 2. Neither is it abſolutely true that <hi>Aerius</hi> was accounted an Heretique for this opinion, excluſively to other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his, as my Adverſaries words import. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he meant them, I will pinch it, Either he means for this opinion only, or for this opinion with other opinions. If for this opinion concurrently with others, this derogates from the common ſenſe of his words and from his uſe too: becauſe if he was accounted an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique for ſeverall opinions, it may be ſome of them
<pb n="985" facs="tcp:40740:447"/> were not heretical opinions; and then it cannot be ſaid that he was for every of them accounted an heretick; unleſs we could make ſome to be hereſies, which are not hereſies; and this would be a contradiction. Well then, I take him to mean that <hi>Aerius</hi> was accounted an heretick for this his opinion excluſively to other opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a negative preciſion; and then I ſay it is not true. And to bring it to the teſt, one of his Authors ſhall be mine, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Catalogue of hereſies <hi>N.</hi> 53. He tells us of <hi>Philaſter</hi> that he had made an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hereſies; and after him, more perfectly <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius:</hi> and he came after them, and he gives us an account of the Arrians from <hi>Aerius:</hi> and ſeveral things he does ſay of him, that he was ſorry that he was not a Biſhop; and that having fallen in <hi>Arrianorum here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi> (into the hereſie of the Arrians) he added alſo ſome proper opinions, ſaying that we "ought not to pray or offer oblations for the dead; and that ſet faſts were not ſolemnly to be obſerved; and alſo that a Presbyter ought not to be by any difference diſtinguiſhed from a Biſhop. And ſome ſaid of him that they were alſo <hi>Eneratites,</hi> and <hi>Apotactites.</hi> So then, the reſult hereof is this; if he could not ſay <hi>Aerius</hi> was accounted an heretick, onely, for this. Nay St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth contradiſtinguiſh here hereſie to proper opinions. So he might be an heretick and not for proper opinions, becauſe he had fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hereſie of the Arrians; yea and ſome account him an heretick for not diſtinguiſhing betwixt a Biſhop and a Presbyter; therefore though his proper opinions were in the judgement of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> heretical, yet can it not be ſaid that he was accounted an heretick onely for denying prayers for the dead: which was to be ſhewed by me. And if for this opinion disjunctively, yet not for denying prayer for the dead in his ſenſe; which was to be ſhewed by him. And therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, we cannot <hi>ſubmit</hi> to Tradition as
<pb n="986" facs="tcp:40740:448"/> 
               <hi>infallible:</hi> becauſe this Tradition, in the Roman ſenſe, bears falſe witneſs of its ſelf: nor to the Church, if it fallibly pretends infallible Tradition. Neither can <hi>prudent reaſon</hi> make infallible aſſent; unleſs the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions could be better than their premiſes. Prudent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were more apt to make Science; which they have no cauſe to be inclinable to neither: becauſe it is more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to their implicit Faith.</p>
            <p>And he hath no cauſe therefore to ſay, <hi>How many true Beleevers commended in Scripture cannot give ſo prudent a reaſon for what they believed?</hi> Anſ. All the reaſon of Faith which can be given, if we take Faith in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of an infallible aſſent, muſt be grounded upon infallible principles: if any <hi>believed</hi> upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it was not properly Faith; and therefore it cannot be ſaid in propriety of the notion (which the Romaniſt alſo ſtands upon) that they believed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If he takes Faith in a looſer ſence for an aſſent upon humane Authority, this is not to the queſtion; and we can allow Tradition its influence hereunto. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If he means that they could not give a more <hi>prudent reaſon for what they beleived,</hi> as to others that ſhould ask them a reaſon of their Faith; this we can yield as to univerſal Tradition, that by the inartificial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Authority we can give no more prudent reaſon than by Tradition. But this doth not hit the queſtion, whether the teſtimony private of the Spirit of God makes not a better aſſurance of Faith to our ſelves, though this is not demonſtrable to others, that we have this aſſurance by the Spirit of God. Therefore fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This will not do the buſineſs, unleſs what he ſaies, he proves from Scripture. We have urged the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the example of the <hi>Beraeans</hi> and the term [belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving] in Scripture is not ſeldom taken not of an internal act of Faith ſubjective, but an external profeſſion of faith objective. And ſo <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is ſaid to have believed.
<pb n="987" facs="tcp:40740:448"/> Here he gives us occaſion to wiſh he had done ſo before as he does here, in putting his ſenſe into ſome form, thus; <hi>Faith being an infallible aſſent, controverſies concerning Faith cannot be determined ſo as to end them effectually, but by an infallible living judg who can hear you &amp; me, &amp; be heard by you &amp; me: but no other than the Church can (with any ground) be held to be this living Judge, therefore ſhe muſt be held to be the Judge.</hi> Anſ. Firſt to the major, and we ſay that it begs the queſtion in two Suppoſitions; Firſt, That there is a neceſſity of controverſies in points of Salvation. And ſecondly that it is neceſſary to Salvation, that all controverſies (though not in points of Salvation) ſhould infallibly be determined: When theſe two ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſufficiently made good, we ſhall grant him the major; and yet then alſo that infallible Judge is yet bound to judge by law of Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And then as to the minor: we ſay ſecondly, This ſpeaks for the Church univerſal; which then, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Adverſaries Principles, ſhould alwaies have a true Pope and a true ſtanding General Council; or elſe we ſhould think God had not provided for his Church <hi>ad ſemper.</hi> Now if it be ſaid ſome controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies may ariſe which are not ſo neceſſary to be decided in order to Salvation, then he deſtroys his major, which goes in part upon that Suppoſition; and ſo in this he is one of us. Therefore thirdly, We can retort his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>mutatis mutandis; Faith being an infallible aſſent</hi> requires an <hi>infallible Authority.</hi> But the Church is not yet proved to have an infallible Authority; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be the Scripture. Fifthly, If he means his infallible Living Judge of the Roman Church, we deny that this Judge <hi>will explicate all doubts:</hi> for how hath it ended all controverſies in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council? Indeed that Council hath made more, about the ſenſe of ambiguous definitions: and therefore though his major propoſition were true <hi>de poſſe</hi> (which yet we deny
<pb n="988" facs="tcp:40740:449"/> upon the former conſiderations) yet we were to ſeek <hi>de velle:</hi> and then ſhould we be never a whit the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</p>
            <p>And as touching that Text (whereby he would prove that the Bible cannot end all controverſies, becauſe it cannot end the controverſie about it with the Arrians) <hi>theſe three are one.</hi> We ſay firſt, in ingenuity, he needed not to have taken notice of it. Secondly, We ſhould not by right have diſputed the ſubject of the queſtion, whether this or that be Scripture or not: Our diſpute is about the predicates of ſcripture. Thirdly, the Arrians were ſufficiently condemned by another Text, as before: and therefore there is no ſuch neceſſity of the queſtion. Fourthly, We rather believe the Church than the Arrian herein: But let it be put to the pinch; and there were more Faith required in it than the matter afforded; can the Church determin it by her own Authority infallibly? It not, why doth he raiſe the duſt? If it can, why is it not formally done? Therefore either this Text hath not given neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to an infallible Judge: or the infallible Judge hath deceived us in not taking the occaſion.</p>
            <p>And therefore to put his other diſcourſe into a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better forme; thus, whatſoever requires infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſent muſt have an infallible Authority. <hi>Diverſs points not propoſed clearly in Scripture,</hi> the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an infallible aſſent to, therefore ſhe muſt have infallible Authority; we anſwer, granting the major; (which yet they have no reaſon to urge unleſs they had more firm Principles) that the aſſumption may be true <hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de jure.</hi> And then again, It is yet denied that ever the Church Univerſal did ever exact this. As to the right hereof, ſhe muſt prove her infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Authority too hereunto; as to the fact, it muſt be proved by our Adverſaries. Therefore ſince I am reſpondent, I may conclude thus, Things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="989" facs="tcp:40740:449"/> to Salvation are plainly ſet down in Scripture: thoſe points are not plainly, ſet down in Scripture, ſaies he, therefore I conclude, they are not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Here he makes a return to my Argument againſt him,<note place="margin">N. 18.</note> that if that muſt be Judge which can hear him and me, and be heard by him and me; then Tradition is thus excluded from being the Judge: here he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth, <hi>It is the Church who propoſeth theſe Traditions, and not the Traditions, which are our judge.</hi> Anſ. This is eaſily taken away, for according to their Principles, Tradition muſt be Judge of the Church: If their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Argument be good that we muſt not ultimately be aſſured in point of Faith by the Scripture, becauſe we do not know what is Scripture but by the Church; ſo alſo we cannot ultimately be aſſured in point of Faith by the Church, becauſe we cannot tell which is the Church but by Tradition. And if it be Judge of the Scripture in the Canon of it, as they muſt ſay, then ſurely it may be Judge of the Church, becauſe (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by the <hi>Fathers</hi> opinion the Church muſt be proved by Scripture. Again by Tradition was the Faith of Chriſtian Doctrine bred in the minds of the Barbarian Nations as we have it ſaid before, by my Adverſary: therefore Tradition muſt be the infallible Judge, or elſe they had not the ſame Faith which the Roman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, by an infallible Judge; or if they had, then there are more infallible Judges: or Faith may be had without an infallible Judge; or Traditions and the Church are all one; and then the diſtinction is none. And yet alſo this anſwer of his I did provide for before in theſe words, <hi>but you ſay the Church doth determine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (by Tradition) then may it determin by Scripture more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and more univerſally.</hi> And to this he replies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but holds the concluſion.</p>
            <p>From hence he skips to anſwer me about that which I oppoſed to his Judge excluſively to any other, I urged
<pb n="990" facs="tcp:40740:450"/> that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> that an heretick is condemned by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <q>namely, (as I diſcourſed) by the Law of God within him by vertue of Conſcience, which can and does, and ſhould apply the truths of God to the cenſure and condemnation of errour in us &amp;c.</q> To this he ſaies, <hi>he is not an heretick but an infidel, who is told by his own Conſcience that he gain-ſaith the Scripture.</hi> Anſ. Firſt, Then the Scriptures are ſo clearly the Word of God that an Infidel may be told thereof by his own Conſcience. If not ſo, then his words have no ſenſe: If ſo, then may we ſee the Scripture to be the Word of God by its own light, as the Heathens did the Law of nature; and then he contradicts his own former diſcourſe. Secondly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not of an Infidel, but (in <hi>terminis terminantibus</hi>) of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, who ſuppoſeth the Scriptures to be the Word of God; though by conſequence he denies it in Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as to the point of hereſie. So that the Text cannot be ſo put off. And though every Chriſtian is <hi>readier to die than to diſbelieve any one ſaying of the Scripture;</hi> yet the heretick who ſuppoſeth the Scripture in <hi>Theſi</hi> and in general, may yet deny it in the application againſt him; and for this he is to be rejected, becauſe he goeth againſt his own Principles of Scripture, which do condemn his hereſie in his own conſcience, though outwardly he oppoſeth. And he helps his cauſe no better with another ſhift, <hi>When St.</hi> Paul <hi>wrote thoſe words, the whole Canon of the Scripture was not written; and until the whole Canon was written, your own</hi> Doctors <hi>grant the Church to have been the infallible judge of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</hi> Anſ. If he takes [whole] ſo as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in order to the <hi>Canon,</hi> I grant that the <hi>whole Canon</hi> was not then written: but if he takes it in oppoſition to a ſufficient direction by what was then written, I deny it; there was then as much written as was ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation: for how could St. <hi>Paul</hi> otherwiſe
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:40740:450"/> ſay to <hi>Tim.</hi> That the Scriptures then were able to make him wiſe unto Salvation? thus I diſtinguiſh of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part: but then 2. the latter I doe deny, that our awn Doctours do ſay that the Church was the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge of controverſies, until <hi>the whole Canon of the Scriptures was written:</hi> for then the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Phariſes had been infallible. No; the word of God was infallible when it was not written, but not the Church. Therefore he miſtakes the purport of finiſhing the Canon, which was not ever held by us to ceaſe the infallibility of the Church, but to accompliſh the matter of Scripture; and ſo it doth exclude <hi>verbum non Scriptum.</hi> Infallibility of the Church was never held: but the Canon of Scripture was allwaies ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, providing allwaies that the Church in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration be meant contradiſtinctly to the writers of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Neither needs he to wonder at my ſaying that <hi>the Church then was not ſufficiently formed thereunto;</hi> namely to a definition of what was to be held therein. To this he ſaies, the Church was formed <hi>before</hi> St <hi>Pauls conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and before his converſion the number of Deſciples was multiplied.</hi> Anſ. The terme [Church] is very ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. He takes it here of the Church vertual, or of the Church repreſentative, or of the Church diffuſive. The Church vertual, which the Ieſuits ſay is the Pope, was not yet formed. The Church Repreſentative as they ſay in a Council confirmed by the Pope, was not yet formed. There was no council General till after three hundred yeares; nor Pope ſo ſoon, in their ſenſe. A Church diffuſive there was: but this ſerves not his turn: for we muſt ſpeake of ſuch a Church formed ſo, that the heretique ſhould be condemned for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the definition of the Church. Now the definition of the Church according to my Adverſary, is by the Church Repreſentative, and this was not then formed
<pb n="992" facs="tcp:40740:451"/> Then again, to take his own words; either the <hi>Church was not then formed moſt compleatly with all things neceſſary to infallible direction to the true faith;</hi> or it was. Let them now ſay which they will. Then no neceſſity of Pope and Council, yea no neceſſity of Pope or Council. If it was not compleatly formed, then my former anſwer obtains. And beſides if he had been condemned by himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the Church, then had he been condemned by himſelf extrinſecally to himſelf; or he and the Church muſt have been all one: therefore whether he had the doctrine from the Church, or immediately from any one of the Apoſtles; yet was he condemned by that doctrin as being impreſsed upon his own Conſcience. So that I have as much as I can deſire by this diſcourſe, namely that, is poſſible for us to be Judged and condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelves of Hereſie, without an externall Judge: which then was not fully and exactly I am ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted according to the mind of our Adverſaries; although, in purity of doctrine, the Church was better then, <hi>then ever ſhe was ſince that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 19</note>In this he begins more ſolemnly to tell us what he means by the <hi>name of the Church,</hi> and wherein conſiſts the power of infallibility in a <hi>Decree or definition of the Church.</hi> And firſt he tels us who are to be excluded from a deciſive voice, Children and women and laymen and inferiour Clergy, thus he proceeds firſt by excluſions, as they do in the choiſe of a Pope. And then he goes on by way of a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſo he makes the ſubject of the power of this Decree to be the prime paſtours &amp; Praelats of the Church, aſſembled together in a lawfull General Council with their Chief Paſtour and Head the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> This the progreſs of this Paragraph. Well, but our queſtion is of the praedicate, whether the Church thus conſtituted is infallible in its Decrees, and therefore ſince he here hath no argument, he hath bound us not to have an anſwer. And yet may we note, that if he means
<pb n="993" facs="tcp:40740:451"/> the formation of a Church to be thus, we can more clearely contradict him in what he ſaid formerly, that the Church was formed before St. <hi>Pauls</hi> converſion. It was not ſo formed. And yet 2. We may as well diſpute here the ſubject of the queſtion [whether the Church thus formed is infallible in its decrees] as he diſputes the <hi>an ſit</hi> of Scripture, when we were upon the praedicate whether the Scripture be ſufficient to Salvation. And ſurely I may do this legally, becauſe I am a reſpondent; and I may do it alſo more boldly, becauſe I know they cannot make good the praedicate, that this Church is (thus formed) infallible in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres. And as to his excluſions then we could confront him with the opinion of <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro,</hi> who would have had a chapter againſt him for his excluſions: ſince he maks the acceptation of the diffuſed Church to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inerrability. And as to the <hi>Chief Paſtour and Head,</hi> he ſpeakes it <hi>cum privilegio</hi> ſurely, as if not only what the Pope ſaid was not to be queſtioned, but alſo what is ſaid of him. They will never prove that there ever was to be any ſuch <hi>Chief Paſtour</hi> and Head of the Church univerſal, <hi>dejure</hi> nor can they ever prove that there was <hi>de facto,</hi> any one ſo called, till <hi>Boniface</hi> the third; who had the Title granted him by <hi>Phocas.</hi> But <hi>non fuit ſic ab initio.</hi> And the rule is good, <hi>Errores ad ſua principia reducere eſt refellere.</hi> And therefore either the Church was not allwaies infallible, or was infallible without Councils, becauſe for above three hundred yeares was no General Council; and therefore why doth he urge the neceſſity of Councils unto infallibility? And when there was Councils afterwards till <hi>Trent</hi> Council inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively either the Councils were fallible with a Pope, or might be infallible without him; becauſe till <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the third there was no ſuch Pope as Head, or Head as Pope. And therefore why do they urge the neceſſity of a Pope for their infallibility? This he did <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
<pb n="994" facs="tcp:40740:452"/> before: and now ſhould have been proved; ſince he knew that this is not granted on both ſides, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be the Word of God.</p>
            <p>And he that is a <hi>ſeeker of his religion</hi> will never find the Pope to be in the Church, as a King in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; who is no part of the repreſentative properly. And if he would have the Pope no more than part of the Repreſentative, he ſhould be no more Head of the Church than as a Speaker in an Aſſembly. And how ſhould he be then the Church virtual, as the high Romaniſts doth ſpeak of him? And therefore the Pope in the time of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council would not ſuffer that title of the Council to proceed, that it ſhould be called the Repreſentative, becauſe though he and his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers eſteemed him the Head of the Church (and ſo ſhould have been ſuperiour to the body of the Church) yet he conceived that they intended to take him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely in the Repreſentative, and ſo to exclude his Head-ſhip. But ſecondly, He then allows a man to be a <hi>ſeeker of his Religion:</hi> then he doth allow him that liberty (which he ſometimes hath diſputed againſt) namely to exerciſe his judgement of diſcretion in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; for he would have him <hi>moſt prudently</hi> judge himſelf <hi>bound to to joyn her (the Church) in Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that ſhe directed moſt ſecurely in Faith.</hi> So this is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r ſenſe: they allow diſcretion to joyn with them; but not to differ. Thirdly, Should he be <hi>bound to joyn himſelf</hi> to the whole Church, or not? If to the whole, then to that part locally which moſt agrees with the whole in Doctrine, and diſcipline, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. But then can he not <hi>moſt prudently</hi> joyn himſelf to the Roman Church, becauſe that hath gone away from the Catholique in all thoſe particulars. And therefore we may conclude it to be our wiſdom to find our direction in Faith <hi>moſt ſecurely</hi> in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 20.</note>This number he ſpends in the power of Councils: To
<pb n="959" facs="tcp:40740:452"/> ſuch power I made exceptions, he would here remove them. The firſt about the uncertainty of the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pope. To this he ſaies, <hi>he to whom the Church ſubmitteth in calling the Council, and whom the Church admitteth as her lawful Head, to preſide,</hi> he is right; <hi>theſe acts do ſupply all defects in the election.</hi> But firſt, Suppoſe he be not a Prieſt. Can the Churches ſubmiſſion or admiſſion of him make him a regular Pope? And this, That he is a Prieſt, they cannot be ſure of by certainty of Faith, according to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, unleſs they had an omniſcience to know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Ordainer; and whether he was a right Biſhop or not. Secondly, If ſo, then <hi>Cajaphas</hi> was a right High Prieſt, as before: and yet he erred with the Council. Therefore a Pope with the Council may erre. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was ſubmitted to, was admitted by the aſſembly of the Jews: but this before.</p>
            <p>And as to that he ſaies, put the caſe <hi>of a Pope defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a lawful Council, and then prove him fallible, if you can.</hi> We anſwer, Firſt it ſeems then he would not ſtand to the maintaining of a Popes infallibility without a Council. And ſo then he and the Jeſuits muſt differ in the point of infallible direction. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If the Pope be not infallible without a Council, then is it not infallible in a Council. What will they here ſay, Is he infallible without a Council, as the Jeſuits ſay; or with a Council onely. If not without, then not with. My reaſon is this: becauſe without the infallibility of the Pope, we are not ſure of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of the Council. For though we ſuppoſe an aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God to Councils: yet can we not be aſſured whether to ſuch a Council in particular; this is yet a queſtion; becauſe we cannot tell whether it be a right General Council or not; not by certainty of Faith ſurely, unleſs the Pope be infallible in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining this to be a right General Council. Thirdly,
<pb n="996" facs="tcp:40740:453"/> Take the former propoſition of his, He to whom the Church ſubmitteth in calling the Council, and whom the Church admitteth as her lawful Head, ſo as <hi>to preſide,</hi> he is right. Thus he in effect and terms moſt what; and then we make an aſſumption to it. This was in the four General Councils; The Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, he did call them; he did preſide in them, therefore where is his concluſion? Fourthly, General Councils are fallible though they do not erre: It is poſſible that they may erre, and therefore are they fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. Well but more, The <hi>Trent</hi> Council did erre, the <hi>Trent</hi> Council was a General Council, according to them; therefore the major is proved already: they erred in the Latin Bible: they erred in half Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: they erred in point of merit; which is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken excluſively to more.</p>
            <p>As for the 3. exception he refers me to <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de concil. cap.</hi> 19. that <hi>although a Council without a Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not define any article of Faith, yet in time of Schiſm, it can judge which is true Pope.</hi> Anſ. firſt, How could he ſay that the Church is ſo direct a way that fools could not erre; (as before) when yet he will ſuppoſe ſuch a time of Schiſm and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> too, <hi>quando neſcitur quis fit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Papa,</hi> when it is not known who is the true Pope. Well then during the time of the Schiſm who ſhall determin emergent controverſies? Neither is the Council called; and what a tedious debate amongſt them may there be to determin who ſhould be next to Chriſt, and if the Council ſhould be as long in calling, and as long in being as the <hi>Trent</hi> Council was (forty three years in both as ſome account) how many might be damned in their direct way? or elſe it was not ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous for ſome controverſies to be undetermined infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly. Yea, but if ſo, then why do they ſo much preſs a neceſſity of a living Judge for deciding all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies? According to the vehemency of their plea,
<pb n="997" facs="tcp:40740:453"/> and the neceſſities of the Church, the Living Judge ſhould not only be alwaies infallible: but this infallible Judge ſhould be alwaies living. But ſecondly, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the Schiſm, how ſhall we do for the Calling of a true Council? To this he ſaies, for this <hi>the Prelats of the Church might and ought to meet upon their own authority and aſſemble themſelves.</hi> Anſ: Then the power of calling Councils is not abſolutely in the Pope; but in <hi>actu primo,</hi> it is radicated in the Prelats, though bound from the ſecond act by uſe of their Church unleſs in falling. Then a ſupream Eccleſiaſtick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not by divine inſtitution ſubjected in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And then what becomes of their Monarchy: It ſeems then that Fabrick is not built upon Gods ground, becauſe no practice can hold good againſt a divine inſtitution. And thus the Head of the Church muſt ſhake: at leaſt the Jeſuits will ſhake their heads at this Doctrine. If there be an abſolute neceſſity of a true Pope to call Councils, then that which he ſaies is not good; if but of conveniency, then we may end the controverſie, becauſe either all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies are not neceſſary to be ended, or may poſſibly be ended without their Head of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the next place he toucheth then upon my exception againſt infallibility <hi>quoad nos</hi> of General Councils, by reaſon of doubtfulneſs of their lawfulneſs upon the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them; ſince in the old time Emperours called them, not Popes. His anſwer now is, <hi>Your Church which never had nor ſhall have General Councils, is to ſeek in all things belonging to them, our Church in every age ſince</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>hath been viſibly aſſembled in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Melibe putavi,</l>
               <l>Stultus ego huic ſimilem noſtrae.—</l>
            </q>
            <p>Therefore he does well to give us a kind check for our preſumption of thinking our Church comparable
<pb n="998" facs="tcp:40740:454"/> with theirs. Firſt, We do not arrogate to our ſelves a power of calling General Councils: yet we may know what belongs to General Councils as well as another particular Church. And time was when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm</hi> had by <hi>Urban</hi> ſome comparable reſpect in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being called as Pope of the other world. And ſecondly, As for their Church to have been <hi>viſibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled almoſt in every age ſince</hi> Conſtantines <hi>time;</hi> if he underſtands it as called by the Roman Authority, it is denied. And therefore what makes this for them, ſince their Church was not viſibly aſſembled, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the whole, but <hi>pro rata parte,</hi> as another particular Church, In the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council their Church had no real ſuperiority, though it had a titular prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Nilus</hi> ſpeaks, becauſe that was at firſt the Imperial City. Thirdly, How was their Church viſibly aſſembled in the fifth General Council, when their Head would not come to the Council upon the debate of the <hi>tria Capitula?</hi> and yet the Council is to be accounted good without the Pope, yea againſt him; or elſe the number of Councils muſt fail.</p>
            <p>What he ſaies about Emperours is inconſiderable, <hi>It is out of Scripture evident that there is no divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by which, either Emperours be aſſured to be ſtill found in the world; or that when they have that dignity, they be by divine Inſtitution inveſted with a power to call Councils.</hi> Anſ. Firſt, We may then prove a negative out of Scripture, by his firſt words; and to be <hi>evident</hi> too; which yet were not good, if <hi>verbum non ſcriptum</hi> were good. Secondly, We by the ſame law prove a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Popes in the ſame tenour. Thirdly. As for Emperours, we have more for them in the proportion of Kings: for we have a promiſe for them that they ſhould be nurſing Fathers, and Queens nurſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which ſurely was accompliſhed by the firſt
<pb n="999" facs="tcp:40740:454"/> Chriſtian Emperour. Yea the term of Kings was then common for Emperours. Yea had not the Kings of the Jewiſh Church Divine Authority in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; <hi>Circa ſacra?</hi> They had not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to defend it: but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to rule it, they were not only Protectours of the Church, as they are called in the <hi>Trent</hi> hiſtories, but governors, and by theſe were the foure Generall Councils called; namely by the Emperours without any contradiction of Councils. Did the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil queſtion <hi>Conſtantines</hi> authority to call Councils, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was Divine or not? How many humble expreſſions and actions of reſpect and ſubjection did come from the Councils and the Fathers, which are not indeed ſuitable to the deportment of that Pope who trod upon the neck of <hi>Frederick the Emperour;</hi> or of him that threw the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> under his table with the dogs? The competition then betwixt Emperours and Popes in point of Eccleſiaſtique authority, as to the outward part of Religion, will come to this. No inſtitution of Popes, in their ſenſe, by Scripture. There is under an Evangelicall promiſe an apopintment of kings to be nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers and of Queens to be nurſing Mothers. And in <hi>triumphum,</hi> we might compare them as to the practice of the primitive times; there was calling of Generall Councils by Emperours; none by Popes till they uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Therefore <hi>Ocham</hi> to the King may end it, <hi>Tu me defende gladio, ego te defendam verbo,</hi> do you defend me with the Sword? I will defeind you with the word. This to his firſt anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly as for the Praelates of the Church we can ſhew Divine inſtitution,</hi> Actes 20.28. <hi>Biſhops placed by the Holy Ghoſt over all the flock; to feed or govern the Church of God. And Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>Not lay Magiſtrates but only Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical are ſaid to be given us by Chriſt for the worke of the miniſtry</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. Firſt I think that the adverſaries living would goe near to ſtarve if they would eate nothing
<pb n="1000" facs="tcp:40740:455"/> before they proved that <hi>feeding</hi> there ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of governing; as it muſt be, unleſs he ſpoke in a proper diſjunctiveneſs, when he ſaid [feed or govern] and if ſo he gives us leave to take it not for him, who muſt get out of it the ſenſe of governing, this indeed is laboured by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpecially; and he conteſts much for it with <hi>Luther</hi> in his firſt <hi>b. de Rom. Pontif.</hi> 15. <hi>ch.</hi> Upon that which is ſaid to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by Chriſt, feed my ſheep. His argument is from the term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſometimes ſignifies to rule: right; but it doth not follow that it ſhould therefore ſignifie ſo there upon the 21. of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> we may therefore confront him with a ſtronger argument. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is twice uſed there, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but once. Now <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth not ſignifie to rule; therefore we ſhould rather expound the other word by theſe, then by it ſelf. And as for his inſtance out of the ſecond <hi>Pſ.</hi> 9. ver. where he would have the Hebrew to bear the ſame ſenſe, he is miſtaken or worſe (as I think I have noted before) for the Hebrew word there doth not at all ſignifie to feed, but to break, it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as in <hi>Ben Iſraels</hi> editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And by others though it be not read with a Vau, yet there is a cholem; and <hi>Montanus</hi> renders it <hi>[conteres]</hi> thou ſhalt break. So then as to the former Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. It can no way be proved that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is to be conſtrued to rule, which is only to their purpoſe. Yea <hi>Montanus,</hi> and the Tranſlation of the Syriack, and of the Arabick, and of the Aethiopick, render it not by <hi>regere</hi> but by <hi>paſcere.</hi> Yea 2. Suppoſe that the word therefore doth ſignifie to govern, yet doth it not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that the Text ſhould be underſtood of Biſhops of proper name; but may be underſtood of ſimple Presbyters and without any derogation to Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal government; becauſe they have a power under the Biſhops to rule their particular Churches; namely their particular flocks, although they have no power
<pb n="1001" facs="tcp:40740:455"/> over the other paſtours as the Biſhops have, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeb the Apoſtles in the point of government as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> ſpeaks in his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius.</hi> 3. Suppoſe the verbe be to be underſtood of ruling, and ſuppoſe that Text to mean, as ſome, proper Biſhops (taking <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in an higer notion) yet my Adverſaries will be yet diſappointed of their end by that Text, becauſe we have found Divine inſtitution of Kings and we cannot find in this Text an inſtitution of Biſhops to be above them in calling of Councils, and ordering the outward part of the Church. Yea 4. if that Text doth intend a power in them, by the Holy Ghoſt, of calling Councils, then for ought I ſee, the power muſt be primarily ſubjected in them and not in the Pope; and therefore he muſt not be the chief paſtour and Head of the Church; which contradicts them: if then they intend by the Text a proof of ſuch a Divine inſtitution of Praelates to govern the Church as to call Councils thereby, this derogates from the Pope: And if they intend not ſuch a power to be given to the Praelates as to call Councils; how doth this prove that the Pope is to call Councils, from this Text? Yea how do they prove that Kings or Emperours are not to call Councils: for though Praelats are to govern the Church, Yet Kings or Emperours might call Councils, theſe are not oppoſits but agreeable; becauſe the Praelats may govern in <hi>ſacris,</hi> the Kings or Emperours <hi>circa ſacra.</hi> The ſpeculative deciſion is to be by the Praelats: the outward adminiſtration by the Emperours. The <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas</hi> in <hi>actu ſignato</hi> in them; in <hi>actu exercito,</hi> in the Emperours.</p>
            <p>And as for the other Text <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. We need ſay nothing; or only this, that the not naming of Lay Magiſtrates there, doth not exclude them elſe where. Doth it? If it does not, where is their argument? If it doth, then by the ſame law of conſequence there are
<pb n="1002" facs="tcp:40740:456"/> no Praelats to have any Divine Authority for the good of the Church, becauſe where it is ſaid, Kings ſhall be the nurſing Fathers and Queens the nurſing Mothers, there is no mention of Eccleſiaſtical Praelats. So then let them ſpeak no more of the Fathers of the Church. And then 2. This comes not to the point of the queſtion, that Lay Magiſtrates are not here ſpoken of but <hi>only Eccleſiaſticall are ſaid to be given us by Chriſt for the work of the Miniſtry;</hi> for to the work of the miniſtry no man aſſerts the power of a Lay magiſtrate, but external government is contradiſtiguiſhed to the work of the miniſtry; which conſiſts in miniſterial acts. Yea 3. Is that Text to be underſtood of government of the Church? If it be not, then it is impertinently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. If it be, then by his former argument, the Pope is excluded, becauſe here is no mention of any appointment of him <hi>ſub ratione ſingulritatis</hi> and in way of eminencie, nay not of any priority: and therefore he by this account in all his <hi>Pontificalaibus</hi> is but an human Creature. Therefore upon the account of the Text we will ſtand our ground, and <hi>not be carried about with every wind of doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly the Emperour is not by Divine inſtitution Lord of the Chriſtian world, the power of the chief Paſtour of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church is coextended to the univerſal Church.</hi> Anſ. Firſt <hi>Dato,</hi> ſuppoſe there were by Divine inſtitution (which will never be proved) a chief paſtour of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, yet the Emperour might be Lord of the Chriſtian world too in his external faculty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this concludes not. 2. this Language was not knowen till <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, in the ſeventh century. The Roman Biſhop had the honour to be called the Biſhop of the firſt Sea or ſeate. And yet not the firſt Biſhop in way of juriſdiction, 3. The Emperour may be as much Lord of the Chriſtian world by Divine inſtitution, as well as the Pope: for both are by
<pb n="1003" facs="tcp:40740:456"/> election, the Pope is to be choſen by Cardinals, which cannot ſhew a Divine inſtitution. But then alſo he allowes <hi>Political proceeding from a temporal power:</hi> yet he will not have it to be <hi>an Eccleſiaſtical calling, ſuch an one as the Pope called them by at the ſame time.</hi> Anſ. Not Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſubjective, but Eccleſiaſtical objective it was. And yet alſo <hi>Rex eſt mixta perſona cum Sacerdote.</hi> And therefore it may be the Hebrew word <hi>Cohen</hi> ſignifieth both Magiſtrate and Prieſt. Order, and freedom, and time and place belong to the Magiſtrates admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. And as for the Pope (in their ſenſe) his giving an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> call at the ſame time it is utterly denied; unleſs he could give a call before he was borne. And as for the Biſhop of Rome, he met at Councils upon the ſame order with the reſt. Such things he ſhould have proved rather then ſaid. And therefore that was falſly ſpoken by him that the <hi>Politicall proceeding was ſubſervient to the Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Anſ. <hi>Non entis nulla accidentia.</hi> There was no ſuch Eccleſiaſticall call by a Pope: for there was no ſuch Pope. And 2. Though the Emperours calling was ſerviceable to Eccleſiaſticall affairs, yet the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons that met were ſervants to him therein. And Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have not abhorred ſuch acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments herein. And whereas ſome Romaniſts have compared the Pope to the Sunne, and the Emperour to the Moon; though ſome Popes ſince have eclipſed the Emperour: yet ſome Emperours before have not only Eclipſed the Pope, but have put him out.</p>
            <p>Therfore had he good cauſe to ſay, <hi>Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſometimes Emperours might adventure to call dependent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ratification of the ſupreme Paſtour.</hi> Anſ. ſurely there is more due when Adverſaries will give ſo much. <hi>Nimia perfectio parit ſuſpicionem.</hi> But this will not content us, there was no real entity of ſuch a <hi>Supreme Paſtour.</hi> Nor was he ſo much as then <hi>Ens rationis.</hi> No; the foure Generall Councils, <hi>a primo ad ultimum,</hi> were menaged
<pb n="1004" facs="tcp:40740:457"/> in the call and <hi>ratification</hi> by the Emperours. They gave them not onely <hi>countenance</hi> and a <hi>vote in point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> but alſo their external eſtabliſhment. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and ended them. <hi>Idem eſt principium deſtitutionis &amp; conſtitutionis.</hi> So the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was called by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. The Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was called by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the elder. The Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger. The Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> by <hi>Martianus,</hi> and by them they had their confirmation. And ſo Councils are to be called, as our Church in the 21. Article.</p>
            <p>The fourth anſwer he paſſeth here.</p>
            <p>As to the fifth anſwer, he ſaies; theſe Elections do appear by <hi>authenticated</hi> teſtimonies, <hi>and confirmation.</hi> Anſ. But their Election may not appear free thereby. That which may appear in the fact, may not appear in the qualities. And therefore if it were not free, it were as well no Election, <hi>as if the Council be known no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly to uſe ſuch proceedings we are not to acknowledge it for a lawful Council.</hi> And this puzzles and diſturbs our aſſent more. Infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in Councils is neceſſary to infallible Decrees: this they ſuppoſe. In Councils unlawful there is no infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt: this they muſt grant; and in effect here he doth, otherwiſe how can we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledge any Council, or not <hi>acknowledge it for a lawful Council?</hi> Now then ſince a Council may by <hi>ſuch proceedings notoriouſly known</hi> nullifie it ſelf, how ſhall we be certain whether a Council doth not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally forfeit its aſſiſtance? Although <hi>imdem eſt non apparere et non eſſe,</hi> as to outward cenſures: yet this is not enough for an infallible aſſent of the Decrees to have a charitative opinion of lawful proceedings. If I be deceived in my charitative opinion, no ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: but if I be deceived in my opinion of the Council, I wrong my ſelf in miſgrounding my Faith.
<pb n="1005" facs="tcp:40740:457"/> In point of charity no man is bound to infallibility; but in we point of Faith we are, &amp; therefore I do not well ſee can ever be aſcertained of the infallibility of a Council, how unleſs we be aſcertained of an impoſſibility in the Council to loſe the infallible aſſiſtance. For as we cannot believe the Church's infallibility in one point, unleſs it be infallible in all according to Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> &amp; my adverſaries late Principles; ſo we cannot be aſſured of the lawfulneſs of any one Council by the certainty of Faith, unleſs we can be aſſured of the lawfulneſs of all. Now then if they can infallibly inform us that every Council ſhall have infallible aſſiſtance, we will not diſcuſs at all that which cannot be, namely whether it hath forfeited the priviledges by ſuch proceedings: but though it hath not forfeited its moral being by ſuch proceedings, we yet want a proof infallible whether ſo or not; and then if not, whether it ſhall have infallible aſſiſtance. For ought I know the Holy Ghoſt may be ſaid to preſide there and yet not rule; as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his 1. <hi>B. de con. cap.</hi> 18. ſaies that the Pope in a Council may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Preſident or as Prince: as Preſident, ſo he is to follow the major part; as Prince, ſo he can reſcinde all. Now which hath the Holy Ghoſt following the major part, or the Pope; Is the Holy Ghoſt tied to the Council, as the Heathens faſtned their Gods to their Cities? No they will ſay: not to all, but lawful Councils. But let us then know by the Holy Ghoſt which Councils ſhall be lawful. Otherwiſe, though infallible direction will never deceive us, we may be deceived in infallible direction; ſince there is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him a poſſibility of <hi>humane malice and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and factions, and bandyings, and domineering ſelf-intereſt.</hi> Unleſs they can prove an <hi>extrinſecal over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling providence promiſed by God againſt humane malice, &amp;c.</hi> to all Councils, I ſhall never be ſure whether they are not in any one. And therefore that general Text, the
<pb n="1006" facs="tcp:40740:458"/> 
               <hi>gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt</hi> the Church, will not infer infallibility in a Council, unleſs it could infer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the lawfulneſs according to them; and yet not ſo neither according to us, that Text is made good to every member of the Church inviſible: and is that therefore infallible? If it be, why then is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility arrogated to the Church viſible as the onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? if it be not, then the Text doth not prove abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute infallibility; but onely ſecurity againſt damning errours or practice. Not that the Church viſible is not a mean of that ſecurity; but therefore not a mean univerſally infallible, but with ſpecification. Sixthly <hi>you ask,</hi> how <hi>ſhall ignorant people be divinely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Council is General.</hi> To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers by giving us the means or ſigns of this knowledge; Firſt <hi>publique Summons.</hi> Secondly, <hi>publique appearance of Prelats made upon theſe ſummons from all parts of the world.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>publick ſetting, publick ſubſcribing, publick divulging their Decrees and Definitions acknowledged truly to be theirs by all preſent, denied by no man to be theirs with the leaſt ſhow of probability, no more than ſuch an Act is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be the Act of ſuch a Parliament.</hi> Anſ. Is here all? The queſtion was how <hi>ſhall ignorant people be divinely perſwaded that the Council is general.</hi> And now we muſt be anſwered with a probability. If that which may be known probably be known divinely, <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> upon that account, then a probable Argument may make an infallible concluſion. And why then do they urge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church for point of Faith, which they can never prove? It leſs would have made Faith, they ſhould not in prudence have combated for infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But as long as the concluſion follows the worſe part; and the effect doth not exceed the cauſe; and the aſſent cannot be higher than the ground of it, this anſwer of his is too ſhort for the queſtion. Secondly, were not all theſe neceſſary conditions of a General
<pb n="1007" facs="tcp:40740:458"/> Council belonging to the <hi>Trent</hi> Council? And why then was not the French Church perſwaded to take it for a General Council? Why doth the French Church ſay, <hi>tranſeat concilium Tridentinum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore that which he ſaies is not ſo, that <hi>all theſe motives make it evidently credible to the ignorant and to the learned that this is the true definition of the church.</hi> It is evidently credible to neither. So that though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Church were infallible in it ſelf, as they ſay Scriprure is; yet is it not infallible to us, as they ſay Scripture is not without the Church. Therefore though the Definition were infallible yet cannot they thereby prove the Council infallible: but they are firſt to prove the Council infallible, then that which is a <hi>true definition of the church,</hi> will be infallibly true, becauſe truly infallible.</p>
            <p>So that he needs not tell us that if we <hi>beleive all her Definitions to be true,</hi> we will <hi>alſo believe this Definition to be true;</hi> ſince a particular is included in an univerſal. But before we believe all her Definitions to be true, we muſt demand ſome infallible aſſurance that ſuch a Council is truly univerſal; and that an univerſal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, is truly infallible. Otherwiſe we may believe one Definition, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be true: and yet becauſe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed infallibly, we cannot believe all her Definitions to be true. And therefore hath he not extricated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of <hi>inſuperable difficulties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, which, I ſaid, was contradicted by the French Catholiques, he ſaies <hi>their Definitions concerning Faith were never oppoſed by</hi> France. Anſ. Oppoſition is formally indeed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. But if they were denied onely, it were ſufficient to us. Do my Adverſaries think they may be ſaved, notwithſtanding this denial? This ſurely they deny not. Well then, if they may be ſaved notwithſtanding their denial, then we may be ſaved
<pb n="1008" facs="tcp:40740:459"/> alſo, though we do not ſubſcribe ſome definitions of a Church. Then we are not bound abſolutly under danger of damnation to believe all definitions of the Church. Then the Church hath not infallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But 2. their withdrawing of their aſſent muſt draw in one of theſe two things, either that it was not a General Council (and this <hi>interpretativi</hi> makes a contradiction) or that General Councils are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and this in effect makes a contradiction too. Yea 3. Did not the King of <hi>France</hi> write to the <hi>Trent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil under the name of a <hi>Conventus;</hi> which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued in derogation to a General Council? As appears in the <hi>Trent</hi> Hiſtory. And 4. As for the diſtinction of the definitions concerning faith, as if they were not ſo diſliked, <hi>but ſome things ordained for practice ſeemed leſs ſuitable to the particular ſtate of that Kingdom,</hi> This runnes out as it comes in. For thoſe things towards practice were ordained by the ſame Divine authority: were they not? Or did not the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſt them as to things of practice? If not, then proper obedience is not due to Councils, becauſe proper obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects things of practice: but indeed the whole Council was rejected in groſs; and therefore when Cardinal <hi>Oſſat</hi> mediated for the King of <hi>France</hi> with the Pope, and the Cardinal urged the peace for him without the condition of accepting the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, he wrote to the King what the Pope ſaid one morning to him, becauſe he would not receive the Council, that he had no more reſt that night then a damned ſoule in <hi>Oſſat's</hi> Letters</p>
            <p>And as to the ſeventh anſwer concerning ſome in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council who had Titles of Biſhops; Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> affirmes it in his <hi>Apol. Par.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 62.5. and he names St. <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pates</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> And the former is named in the <hi>Trent</hi> Hiſtory to have been a Biſhop of the poſt, if we may ſay ſo of him for his
<pb n="1009" facs="tcp:40740:459"/> ability in riding poſt ſo well. And if forty Biſhops do all agree in the ſame point of faith (as for a good while there were not many more) what can be be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded againſt a poſſibility that they might be all ſworne ſervants of the Pope? And he that will read the <hi>Trent</hi> Hiſtory will finde ſufficient cauſe not to ſuſpect but to believe that Council not to have had due morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, much leſs infallibility. His beſt way then to ſecure a Council againſt irregularities, is, by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>that nothing ſhall happen deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of ſecure direction</hi> Anſ. this is not ſufficient that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be deſtructive of ſecure direction againſt damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if he means it now ſo) but againſt all errour, for, this he is ingaged to make good, by former denying of that diſtinction of errour damnative and errour not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Yet here he ſeems to warpe in this point. 2. The morality of the Synod is antecedent to its infallible aſſiſtance. Then we muſt have all defects of legality and proceeding removed, before we can be perſwaded of its infallibility. 3. why did he except againſt <hi>Cajaphas</hi> for not being the true High Prieſt, if now <hi>Cajaphas</hi> may <hi>Propheſie, not knowing what he doth, before the ſpirit of truth, ſent to teach the Church all truth, ſhall faile in his duty.</hi> So then notwithſtanding there be not a legall High Prieſt, the ſpirit of God ſhall infallibly act the Council, as he did the Apoſtles. But here is a double duty for them, firſt that the ſpirit of God doth now infallibly teach the Church in all definitions. And then a ſecond, that it is his <hi>duty</hi> to do ſo. Let them learn their duty not to tell God his duty. Did the Holy Ghoſt do his duty when <hi>Cajaphas</hi> and the Aſſembly condemned Chriſt? And why did not the Holy Ghoſt make eight hundred Biſhops in <hi>Ariminum</hi> as infallible without a Pope, as the forty Biſhops in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, whereof ſome might be made Biſhops, not becauſe they did not <hi>differ</hi> from the reſt, but that they might not <hi>differ</hi> in the Roman <hi>Faith,</hi> though againſt the Catholique
<pb n="1010" facs="tcp:40740:460"/> faith? And if they put the difference in this compare upon a Pope in <hi>Trent</hi> Council, none in <hi>Ariminum</hi> (though that anſwer will not ſerve as before) ſince Praelats have a alſo a power of calling Councils (as my Adverſary before) in ſome caſes, why ſhould not the Holy Ghoſt rather aſſiſt eight hundred Praelats without a Pope, then forty with?</p>
            <p>As to the eighth anſwer, he confeſſeth the ſubſtance of it, that for the firſt three hundred yeares there was no General Council, and tells us the cauſe; <hi>for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution no Council could be gathered,</hi> But this ſatisfieth not, God is not wanting in neceſſaries, nor abundant in ſuperfluities, as one of theirs ſaies. If councils had been allwaies neceſſary, he could have provided againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, or for a Council notwithſtanding. And why not in time of perſecutions, as well as in the times of the Apoſtles? Were not thoſe times of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>Neither is that a ſufficient reaſon <hi>becauſe all this time the former doctrine of the Apoſtles remained ſo freſh, and ſo notoriouſly; the Tradition of the Church diffuſed, and there remained alſo ſo univerſal a reſpect and obedience to the Chief Biſhop of the Church.</hi> Anſ. theſe three cauſes will not make one ſound one. For by the firſt he means the known do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles as delivered in writing or not; if ſo, then why may not we by the ſame cauſe ſufficiently be directed by the word written. And as to the ſecond, if he joyns <hi>Tradition of the Church as notoriouſly</hi> diffuſed, as a ſocial mean of the direction, it may be denied upon this account only here, for that other Traditions of Heretiques were then mingled in the Church with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of coming from the Apoſtles. And therefore the Traditions of the Church was <hi>notoriouſly</hi> not diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And as to the third, it is <hi>notoriouſly</hi> falſe that then there was a chief Biſhop in their ſenſe in thoſe times. For how then could equal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be appointed in the <hi>Nicene</hi>
               <pb n="1011" facs="tcp:40740:460"/> Council, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had been Chief before? how could St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> have ſaid that all the Apoſtles were equall, <hi>pari conſortio praediti honoris &amp; poteſtatis?</hi> How could the <hi>African</hi> Council have then cut off appeals to <hi>Rome.</hi> Then had there been no need of the feigning of a Canon to this purpoſe in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. How could St. <hi>Ierom</hi> have ſaid that the Biſhops ſucceeded the Apoſtles <hi>in communi,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrious?</hi> Neither was there ſuch obedience then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them to the Praelats in all places, as may appear by the Epiſtle of <hi>Clement</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> where he ſpeaks of great Schiſms. And alſo by <hi>Ignatius</hi> his earneſt exhortations of ſubmiſſion to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whence the Quartodecim ani although they oppoſed nothing clearely ſet down in Scripture were judged Heretikes for oppoſing the doctrin of the firſt Church, made evidently known by freſh Tradition.</hi> Anſ. Firſt if they will believe their <hi>Alphonſus de caſtro,</hi> they were not ſententially declared Heretikes, becauſe they were excommunicated. Indeed <hi>Victor</hi> would have excommunicated then, <hi>&amp; feciſſet, niſi Irenaeus illum ob hoc redarguiſſet;</hi> he would have done it, if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had not chid him for this. By the way then was this alſo obedience to the chief Biſhop, to chide him? So <hi>Alphonſ.</hi> in his 12. <hi>b. de haer.</hi> In <hi>verbo paſcha.</hi> Yea 2. They may know that <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth give an account of the <hi>Aſian</hi> obſervation to come from as good Tradition, as the the other. And ſurely the <hi>Aſian</hi> Church was therfore the weſtern; and therefore was it not the <hi>doctrin of the firſt Church.</hi> Yea alſo by the way how was Tradition of the Church notoriouſly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed when there was Tradition againſt Tradition? And herein alſo did the Brittiſh Churches (which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeakes of) differ, from the weſtern, following the Eaſtern Church. 3. Hereſie is ſome times largely taken and doth then reſpect Schiſm of proper name: and ſo in a large ſenſe it might by ſome be called Hereſie,
<pb n="1012" facs="tcp:40740:461"/> although the matter of difference was no doctrin of faith. <hi>Ex verbis male prolatis oritur Haereſis.</hi> So Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in a propriety of ſpeech they could not be. 14. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> doth diſtinguiſh here upon in the ſame place, and ſaies they were accounted Hereticks not becauſe they did ſimply obſerve it then, <hi>ſed quia ita eſſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio faciendum credebant.</hi> And this then alters the caſe. And he explains himſelf further, becauſe this did include a neceſſity of obſerveing Judaical ceremonies even after Chriſt's his coming. And ſo then this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word written. And then this was not a Tradition. 5. They here ſhew the pride of <hi>Rome,</hi> to offer to cut off from her comunion all thoſe who were of the other perſwaſion (who were not few, as may be ſeen in <hi>Euſebius's</hi> 5. <hi>B.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Ch.</hi>) for a thing ſimply of free obſervation; wherein difference makes no, variance, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the difference of a faſt (and ſo of a feaſt) doth commend the agreement of faith. He goes on, <hi>now as the Church could want Councils for ſo many years, ſo it could want Councils for the ſhort ſpace of ſchiſm.</hi> Right. But then ſo can it want Councils ſtill: and therefore God hath not bound us over to the Church for our abſolute direction upon neceſſity of Salvation. Councils are neceſſary to infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble direction; ſo my Adverſaries hold: The Church for three hundred years and in time of a Schiſm can want Councils, as my Adverſary here: ſo then there is no abſolute neceſſity of their infallibility. And indeed there was much need of Councils in that ſpace of the firſt three hundred years, in regard of Diviſions, as ſince; and then if God provided ſufficiently for his Church without them, he can and will do ſo ſtill. And this is confirmed by my Adverſary by theſe words of his, <hi>for the necceſſity of new declarations is not ſo frequent at leaſt in any high degree of neceſſity, calling for inſtant remedy, and
<pb n="1013" facs="tcp:40740:461"/> remedy of this nature only.</hi> And he may goe on and ſay it not upon my opinion, but for himſelf, and <hi>ex animo,</hi> that <hi>Scripture alone will remedy this neceſſity.</hi> He needed not to put in <hi>you ſay.</hi> And as to that which he ſaies, that there remained <hi>many definitions oft former councils,</hi> and <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church which alone ſerved Gods church,</hi> theſe we have ſpoken to ſufficiently before. Either the Definitions were concluded out of principles of Scripture; and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were agreeable to the ſubſtance of Scripture, or not: if ſo, then they hold their virtue by Scripture: If not, they remain under debate whether they were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Neither is Tradition before Scripture to be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with traditions after Scripture. We can grant more to the former than we can to the latter; both in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the matter, and in the manner of certification.</p>
            <p>And for the time after the old Teſtament was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he doth well to ſay that it <hi>remained almoſt ſolely and alone to the Jews.</hi> For what was <hi>Iob?</hi> and why might not others of the learned Gentils travail for divine knowledge, as well as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> as <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> ſaith of them.</p>
            <p>Ninthly he anſwers to the cauſe put of a Pope's dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the Council upon a queſtion; he ſaies, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be deferred;</hi> and yet no peril. For if it were neceſſary to have a <hi>preſent definition, the Holy Ghoſt would not forget to inſpire the parties requiſit to do their duties.</hi> Anſ. Again, What neceſſity then of every controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be ended? Secondly, How ſhould the people know whether the buſineſs required a preſent definition. Surely they may know by this, that it did not require a preſent definition, becauſe if ſo, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt would not have forgot to have inſpired the parties requiſite to do their duties.</hi> Well then alſo we can ſay, that we may be as confident that what is not clearly delivered in Scripture doth not require a full definition, becauſe if it had, the Holy Ghoſt would not have forgot
<pb n="1014" facs="tcp:40740:462"/> to inſpire the Pen-men of Scripture <hi>to do their duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the tenth anſwer he is very ſuſpenſive how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf in the point of Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy. He ſaies, a Monarch in ſome Nations <hi>could not do all things without a Parliament.</hi> But he thinks himſelf on the ſurer ſide, that he is <hi>ſufficiently aſſiſted when he defineth with a Council.</hi> Anſ. Firſt, why do they not ſpeak out and tell us which is which? The Church can end all controverſies, as they ſay, but not that capital contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about the Church. That whereby all things are to be made manifeſt, is that not to be made manifeſt? We muſt ſee all things by the light, but the light muſt be private. Do they declaim againſt private Spirits; and will not let us publiquely know the power of the Pope comparately to a Council, and yet they together muſt be the ſubject of publique Authority? And why do they tell us that the Scripture cannot prove it ſelf, and therefore we muſt not reſolve our Faith in that: and yet we muſt reſolve our ſelves in the Authority of the Church, and yet the Church cannot tell us where this Authority Supreme is, or will not? And it is all one to us, for we are in the dark as well by their want of will to ſhew us light, as of power. But ſince it ſeems we may be ſaved in the opinion of the Jeſuit, or in the opinion of the Sorboniſt, we draw this advantage from it, that notwithſtanding we know not infallibly which part of the contradiction to hold in points of queſtion, we may yet be ſecured againſt damnation, <hi>pendenti lite.</hi> And what controverſie is of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an infallible Judge, as who it is? Secondly, Infallibility may be in one as well as in many; ſince it comes by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, then if they think God hath provided abſolutely the moſt plain and expedite way for the direction of his Church, this muſt be placed in the Pope without a <hi>Council.</hi> I hope, the Holy Ghoſt needs <hi>no Council;</hi> which cannot
<pb n="1015" facs="tcp:40740:462"/> ſoon and eaſily be made in all the eſſentials. And therefore he ſhould not have compared the Pope with a <hi>Monarch;</hi> but he ſhould have compared upon this reckoning, a Monarch with the Holy Ghoſt. Then though a Monarch <hi>could not do all things without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet a Pope might do all without a Council: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope ſhould be infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, as the Apoſtles were; but they do not think ſo of a Monarch. Again they think that the Pope is of divine inſtitution; and that a King is meerly a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the peoples, and therefore he that hath a divine inſtitution muſt needs have more divine aſſiſtance. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>when he defineth with a Council,</hi> he defineth not ſo much as Head of the Church, but as a Biſhop <hi>in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> with the reſt; as indeed anciently the cuſtom was; and this derogates from the Monarchy of the Church. And if he had a priority of order, this doth not infer a priority of Jurisdiction over all the Church; which <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> abhorred.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly he ſaies <hi>not one Council</hi> have been oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to another. Anſ. This propoſition in terms is not true. The Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour decreed againſt Images. The ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> decreed for them. And what do they think of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> his judgement betwixt the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and the fifth Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about the Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas</hi> whether it conteined hereſie or not? And is not the African Council againſt Appeals oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, which adds to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Apoſtolique Church the Roman, as making the Roman to be <hi>omnium Eccleſiarum matrem &amp; magiſtram;</hi> of all Churches the mother and miſtreſs. But this hath been touched before.</p>
            <p>He goes on. <hi>In the Nicene</hi> he, (the Pope) <hi>erred not, as you will grant, nor in the three next General Councils, as the Church of</hi> England <hi>grants.</hi> Anſ. He ſaies well, He
<pb n="1016" facs="tcp:40740:463"/> erred not in the firſt <hi>Nicene.</hi> But this antecedent will not make a concluſion or conſequent, that therefore he hath not or cannot erre in others. It followeth not from a negative ſurely of one act to a negative of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; they are to prove that he cannot erre, which is infallibility. But ſecondly, We ſay alſo that he could not erre in the other General Councils neither as Head of the Church, becauſe he was not Head of the Church. He might have erred as a Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but as Head of the Church he could not erre; not that we do aſſert him to have been Head of the Church; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſay he was not Head of the Church; and therefore could not erre as ſuch.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>He ſubſcribed not in the Council of</hi> Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, <hi>how then did he erre in it. Yea becauſe he ſubſcribed not, that Council is never accounted lawful by any but Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Anſ. He ſeems now to come to terms more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. Before he ſpeaks of Councils to be confirmed by the Pope: Subſcription is leſs; and more general. Every confirmation includes eminently a ſubſcription; but every ſubſcription makes not a confirmation. For they will not deny that other Biſhops were wont to ſubſcribe. Secondly, they may know that the 5. council of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> went for good without his Subſcription; nay not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what he publiſhed for the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> which were condemned in the foreſaid Council. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they have no better anſwer (the other Council being held good without his royal aſſent, yea notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his oppoſition) there will be another inſtance of a Council oppoſing a Council: namely the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> oppoſing the Council of the firſt <hi>Nicene.</hi> But thirdly, As to his reaſon why it was not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a lawful Council, <hi>becauſe he ſubſcribed not;</hi> I deny it upon <hi>Sozomen</hi> his account in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. <hi>B.</hi> 23. <hi>ch.</hi> if he takes his not ſubſcribing, as he ſeems to do, for the only cauſe. For he <hi>(Sozomen)</hi> ſaies there
<pb n="1017" facs="tcp:40740:463"/> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe neither the Biſhop of the Romans, nor others did conſent to them, &amp; becauſe many did diſlike thoſe things which were decreed by them. Had they then in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ariminum</hi> decreed according to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, the council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> might have paſſed with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (notwithſtanding the Biſhop of <hi>Rome's</hi> not ſubſcribing it) though not comparatively to the proof of Scripture: but we ſee here in this teſtimony three particulars againſt them. Firſt, That he is here called the Biſhop of the Romans: Not the Biſhop <hi>ſignanter,</hi> nor the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, nor the Biſhop of the Church. He hath but his ſhare with the reſt, and limited by local Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Then how can they ſay that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the <hi>chief Biſhop and Head of the Church?</hi> Secondly, We ſee here, that the Conſent of others concurs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the making of a Council lawful. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſent of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is not that which is the form informant of the Council, nor that which legitimates it. And thirdly, We ſee the reaſon, in part at leaſt, to be, becauſe they diſliked thoſe things which were decreed in the Council of <hi>Ariminum.</hi> And therefore if it had been a full meeting and conſented to, yet had been exceptable againſt in regard of the matter, for ſurely the preſence of all and their Subſcription would not have made that matter to be good which was naught. For then they had declared that to be good which was not; and this had been an errour. Therefore though we receive the four General Councils, we are not bound to receive the Decrees of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, becauſe we do not receive the Council ſimply, but do receive the Council for the Doctrine, not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for the Council. Therefore upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had no great reaſon to admire my inſtancing in the Council of <hi>Ariminum.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="1018" facs="tcp:40740:464"/>
            <p>Neither doth it follow that becauſe one Council hath erred, therefore every one. Therefore that which he ſaies may be falſly reported, that ſome <hi>tax the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of all ages of errours againſt Scripture.</hi> Every one may erre without any impoſſibility. Some have ſhewed a poſſibility by errour. But any ones poſſibility doth not inferre any ones act, much leſs of all. And if any one ſhould have ſaid ſo, they are acquainted well with their own anſwer, they are but private men that ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>And why doth he tell us of <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> that ſpeak diſreſpectively of all Councils? Let them firſt anſwer for ſome body of their black coate who ſaid the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was as a Noſe of Wax. They make to us a need of the phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>As to the twelfth anſwer, We have had the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it alſo before. The incuſtation of it makes it not ſolid. It doth no way follow that becauſe their firſt Council Acts 15. ſaid, <hi>It hath ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us;</hi> Therefore every Council even lawful ſhould ſay ſo. This is to be proved, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And let <hi>Ferus</hi> their own give them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Let them either make it good that every aſſiſtance is infallible, or that every Council had that aſſiſtance which is infallible.</p>
            <p>And their poſtulate, that <hi>Anathemas</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude infallibility in their Councils, is denied them. Secondly, They bind more unto peace than Faith. And ſo their form in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council is, <hi>Si quis haec attentare preſumpſerit &amp;c.</hi> If any ſhall preſume to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt tneſe things, &amp;c. Thirdly, Neither is there ſuch danger by them, unleſs every one were bound to ſubmit his aſſent. Yea me thinks the <hi>Trent</hi> Council doth ſpeak in their beginnings ſomwhat more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly of their Synod, <q>
                  <hi>in Spiritu Sancto legitime congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata,</hi>
               </q> lawfully gathered together in the Holy Ghoſt.
<pb n="1019" facs="tcp:40740:464"/> Every meeting infallible is lawful, but every lawful meeting is not infallible.</p>
            <p>As for his thirteenth Anſwer; he takes into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideartion that of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> touching Councils: And he would diſtinguiſh, that he did not <hi>ſpeak of a lawful free General council called and directed by the chief Paſtour of the church prefiding in it.</hi> So then: He doth deſpiſe all Councils but ſuch, doth he not? Yes they will ſay preſently. Then he deſpiſed all Councils; for there were none ſo called, ſo directed, ſo preſided in his time or before; nor preſently after. The fifth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (which was about 553. under <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> the Emperour) did ſit and determin without and againſt <hi>Vigilius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſecondly, As to that he ſaies, that <hi>Nazianzen's</hi> ſpeech did reſpect the times of the Arrian troubles, which St. <hi>Baſil</hi> takes notice of, we ſay ſuppoſe it: yet this alſo makes a prejudice to all Councils in the time of the Arrian hereſie, becauſe it is very like that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cloſe Arrians might in Council mingle with the Orthodox. And thirdly, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from a reſpect to Councils in the other Fathers unto an aſſerting of their infallibility. A <hi>genere ad ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem non ſequitur affirmative;</hi> becauſe they gave them ſome reſpect, therefore ſuch as imported their infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it doth no way follow. Fourthly, Neither doth <hi>Nazianzen's</hi> reſpect to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council contradict him here: For although that might proceed well in his opinion, yet ſpeaking <hi>de communi,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he might ſay as he ſaid. Neither doth it appear that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it upon its own authority intuitively, but becauſe he approved the Doctrines, otherwiſe why ſhould not eight hundred Biſhops in <hi>Ariminum</hi> be as credible, as not half ſo many in <hi>Nice?</hi> But it may be that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council were Prophetical; and the diſcourſe of thoſe of <hi>Ariminum</hi> was fallible. Yea,
<pb n="1020" facs="tcp:40740:465"/> but they will ſay that the Diſcourſe in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was fallible, though the concluſions Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Let this be proved and we have done. But the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers as before, profeſſed that they proceeded by principles of Scripture in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations. And ſo <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is driven to confeſs in his 12. <hi>l. de concil. Sed ex verbo Dei per ratiocinationem deducunt concluſiones,</hi> they deduce their concluſions from the Word of God by diſcourſe. Let <hi>Bellarmin</hi> then anſwer <hi>Stapleton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the latter end of this Section, He takes me up for a ſaying of the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And he is confident that that account of him hath no credible ground. Anſ. Surely as good ground as <hi>Brierly</hi> had for ſeveral paſſages which he produceth out of our Authors. And if ſome of theirs have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to take teſtimonies upon his credit, becauſe they had not Books by them; I may be eaſily excuſed for asking the queſtion whether the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi> did not ſay ſo and ſo in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> He that asks a queſtion ſeems to be wary of aſſerting. And if the opinion of one able Doctor be ſufficient to make a point probable, as ſome of them have lately ſaid, this point of fact is not altogether unprovided of ſome hope of probability. My Author is Biſhop <hi>Iewel,</hi> who ſpeaks it more than once in his <hi>Apology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither have they cauſe to bragge that their Church <hi>have been the men, who were ſtill imployed in the upholding the Authority of Councils.</hi> Surely my Adverſaries did paſs by <hi>Cajetan, and Bellarmin, and Valentia;</hi> and did not take notice of what they have ſaid towards fallibility of Councils even lawful, that ſo infallibility and Monarchy might be neceſſarily devolved from heaven, as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> into the Pope's lap. All that make perſtriction of the Authority of Councils are not hereticks, it ſeems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome that are good Roman Catholicks do ſpeak of
<pb n="1021" facs="tcp:40740:465"/> their fallibility, ſo, that this infallibility ſhould be intailed upon the Biſhop univerſal. And ſo they differ from my Adverſaries platforme of infallible direction: In this he ſhewes himſelf highly diſpleaſed for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compare the Determinations of <hi>Trent</hi> with the word of God. He thinkes <hi>it fine doctrine that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Councils ſhould be examined by ſuch as I and he is.</hi> Anſ. it is halfe an argument for us that they are angry at this: But firſt we do not ſpeak of an Authoritative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, which is forenſical, but a rational inquiry which is for private ſatisfaction. 2. If the Decrees of that Council be indeed infallible, they will abide the teſt: if not, how can we believe them; Do they think, 3. That we are more bound to believe the council of <hi>Trent,</hi> then the <hi>Beraeans</hi> were bound to believe what was ſaid by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> without diſcuſſing; ſince ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are pleaſed in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council ſomtimes to joyn St. <hi>Paul</hi> as partner with St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the honour of their Church? 3. We may ſurely finde more cauſe to examine the <hi>Trent</hi> Council then ſome others; ſince it hath not yet obteined in the Chriſtian world the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a lawful General Council: therefore though we doe not examin others yet this we may. 4. would they not have us preferre the doctrin of <hi>Trent</hi> before any differing from it? yes ſurely; then we muſt inquire into it, and privately judge it: otherwiſe we make a blind choice. Fifthly, If the conſent of the major part, which is moſt immediatly conſiderable in a Council, ſhould morally bind, why ſhould we not as well believe the Council of <hi>Ariminum;</hi> ſince what elſe he hath pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it, is not cogent? Sixthly, If they think that one cannot think well of a lawful General Council, unleſs he believes their infallibility, that propoſition is eaſily denied. They may be fallible, and yet not fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me in <hi>piety</hi> or <hi>prudence.</hi> Infallible concluſions do not follow upon moral principles. The one makes
<pb n="1023" facs="tcp:40740:466"/> them careful, the other faithful: but though they do not deceive me, they may be deceived themſelves. And if their infallibility did depend upon their piety and prudence, how are we infallibly certain of that upon which their infallibility ſhould be grounded?</p>
            <p>Nor does my conſideration of a Council betray in me a want of <hi>charity</hi> or <hi>humility,</hi> as he ſuppoſeth: they have themſelves as Diſparates to Theological Faith; and are not of the ſame Conjugation. Humility diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth me to think of my ſelf meanly; Charity diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me to think better of others, becauſe I know my own imperfections and do not know anothers perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> notes: But if theſe were diſpoſitive unto Faith, yet not cauſal: If cauſal of Faith, yet of Faith humane, not divine; unleſs I did ſee Gods Word for believing men. This is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; if they can prove this, we have no more to ſay. Until then I can love my Adverſaries, and think humbly of my ſelf: And yet cannot be perſwaded that my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are infallible. And if they were infallible in the diſpute, how ſhould infallibility be the prerogative of the Council confirmed by the Pope? So then as long as I can give reverence to a Council without preſent Faith, I am not <hi>poſed,</hi> but they who muſt beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>In this he chargeth me with ſhifting, becauſe I ſaid now, <hi>let us not ſee the opinions by infallibility: but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility by your determinations,</hi> whereas elſe where I ſay, you ſhould go <hi>a priori</hi> and ſhew that your Church <hi>is infallible, and therefore her definitions to be admitted.</hi> This in effect he ſuppoſeth to be my ſhift to evade his preſſure of me. Anſ. No ſuch matter. Good cauſe for both diſtinguiſh reaſons and reſpects. Firſt, I hope they think it lawful to urge both waies in a different kind of diſcourſe, we demonſtrate the effect by the cauſe; we know the cauſe by the effect. Secondly,
<pb n="1022" facs="tcp:40740:466"/> The way a <hi>Priori</hi> is more diſtinct, and therefore this would preſently make an end of the controverſie, if it could be effected; becauſe it ſatisfies us in the cauſe. Prove the infallibility, and then we fall down or riſe up to the definitions. They are then to be taken <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> and they produce Faith <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as we may ſpeak. This the way of nature: But when they cannot make this good, then the other way, and <hi>quoad nos</hi> is to ſhew us their infallibility by their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; and an eaſie way it is to us to ſhew them the unlikelineſs of infallibility by their determinations. For it is ſufficient to the negative of infallibility, to find one errour in any of their definitions; but it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to them for the affirmative of infallibility, to prove that the Church hath not erred in ſome particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions. The latitude of the power is not diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome acts.</p>
            <q>Quem ſaepe tranſit caſus aliquando invent.</q>
            <p>If it hath erred but once, we are ſure it can erre, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is deſtroyed; if it hath not erred in ſome, yet it doth not follow that it hath not erred in others. Yea, if it hath erred in none, we cannot <hi>ex vi formae</hi> conclude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, unleſs it be proved that the power of erring is bound in the Church Repreſentative, as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay the power of ſinning is bound in the Church Triumphant. Thirdly, We are now upon the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> incidently; and ſo it is very reaſonable for us to go this way with them; becauſe a particular Church hath not the priviledges of the univerſal Church. It is generally ſuppoſed that the univerſal Church cannot erre in things neceſſary; but this is not granted to any Church of one denomination. Now the <hi>Trent</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil belongs to a particular Church, and therefore as to that, our way of proceeding is not irrational. And therefore all that he ſaies <hi>upon this argument</hi> comes to nothing. If all the ſtrength of <hi>Rome</hi> can ſufficiently
<pb n="1024" facs="tcp:40740:467"/> reinforce the former Texts againſt us for the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and then for them, <hi>reducant nos;</hi> if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, <hi>redeant ad nos,</hi> as the Father ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 23.</note>This Section is in good part made up of repetitions towards the reurging on their be half 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> to <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. How much Paper is taken up with petitions and repetitions; petitions of the principle, and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of what was ſaid before. Upon this I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed of a double Pillar; the Principal, Scripture; a ſubordinate one, the Church. And now he ſaies pleaſantly, <hi>this double dealing in diſtinguiſhing helpeth you not. The Church muſt ſtill be a true Pillar and ground of truth.</hi> Anſ. Diſtinguiſhing is plain dealing; double dealing makes confuſion. Therefore we diſtinguiſh again; the Church may be a true Pillar and ground or eſtabliſhment of truth, <hi>ex officio,</hi> and ſubordinately; yet not infallible. That which is infallible is ſuch; all that is ſuch is not infallible. <hi>Dic aliquid contra ut ſimus duo.</hi> He ſhould have contradicted or ſaid nothing. <hi>The people believed God and</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaith the Scripture;</hi> right: But the copulative doth not alwaies equally reduplicate the act to diverſe objects. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs it is ſaid, <hi>Fear God and the King:</hi> yet the King is not to be feared equally with God. So they believed God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the curt faſhion of Hebrew ſpeech: But they did not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> as they did God. God for himſelf upon his own veracity; <hi>Moſes</hi> for God. Now let them prove that God ſpeaks by the Church, as he ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and we have done. God ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> face to face. Did he ſpeak ſo to the Church? He ſpake then to <hi>Moſes</hi> immediatly: doth he ſpeak ſo to the Church. He ſpake to and by <hi>Moſes</hi> who was King in <hi>Ieſuron. Aaron</hi> was formally the High Prieſt: Doth he ſpeak ſo now to and by civil Magiſtrates? If he does, where are the priviledges of the Church, which they vaunt of? If not, why do they urge that
<pb n="1025" facs="tcp:40740:467"/> Text? It is true, <hi>Rex eſt mixta perſona cum Sacerdote;</hi> but this maxim is not for them: Their maxim is inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Sacerdos eſt mixta perſona cum Rege. Moſes</hi> morally wrought miracles; ſo does not now the Church. If <hi>Xaries</hi> could indeed have wrought miracles in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> why did he corrupt the Goſpel? In ſhort, when they can prove, that the Church ſpeaks all they ſpeak by Revelation from God, as the Jews believed, that what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake, he ſpake from God, then they may apply that Text to God, and the Church, which is applied to God and, <hi>Moſes.</hi> The ſenſe of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Moſes</hi> was, that they believed, what he ſaid, to be ſpoken from God; this is now the queſtion of the Church, therefore they ſhould not have compared <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and the Church, but <hi>Moſes,</hi> and an Apoſtle. This had been more Symbolical; but this would not have been ſerviceable. Well then; if they would have been contented with this, that the Church ſhould have been ſubordinate to Scripture, the quarrel would ſoon be ended. What then? Would they have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſubordinate to the Church? <hi>Adieone pudorem cum pudicitia perdiderunt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So he ſaies, <hi>The Church was by St.</hi> Paul <hi>called the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and ground of truth, without ſubordination to Scripture, as then not written.</hi> Anſ. Will they hold themſelves to this, that what is not ſaid in Scripture in terms, is not to be conſtrued as the ſenſe of the Scripture? If they will, then what will become of their points of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as to Scripture? If they will not, then this diſtinction is not to be rejected upon that account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſaid ſo there. But ſecondly, His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe <hi>Scripture then</hi> was <hi>not written,</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. If he underſtands it abſolutely, it is falſe. Was not the Old Teſtament then written? And if the Romaniſt fetcheth his Monarchy of the Church from the Anaology to the Jewiſh High Prieſt, why
<pb n="1026" facs="tcp:40740:468"/> ſhould not the Old Scripture be ſufficient to ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Church. And if the Scripture was then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, to make wiſe unto Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Canon was finiſhed; was it not able to bear the Churches dependance upon it? And is it not as able now, when the Canon is compleated? As to the times of the Church before any part of Scripture was written, we have ſeveral times ſpoken before. Put it into a Syllogiſm, thus; That which God ſpeaks we are bound to believe upon account of his veracity. That which the Church ſpeaks to us, God ſpeaks; therefore. Now as to the major, whoſoever denies it is <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> an Atheiſt. The aſſumption then is that we ſtick at, though the Roman accounts us, for this, not Chriſtians: The times of the Church before any part of Scripture was written, were chiefly thoſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that propoſition was conſented to; and yet not by all that knew the doctrine of the Church. Therefore thoſe who then did believe, had not only a Faith diſpoſing them to believe that what God ſaies is true: For this is ſaid by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in effect <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> this is a propoſition of reaſon, that what God ſaies is true, but they had a divine Faith habituating them to the belief that that which was ſpoken by the Church was truly communicated to the Church from God. Now here the hinge turns, whether their Faith terminated upon the Church, as the <hi>ſubjectum quo,</hi> or upon the matter delivered by the Church, as the <hi>ſubjectum quod.</hi> We deny the former, becauſe divine Faith cannot riſe upon humane teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; &amp; therefore Faith could not be cauſed by ſuch a teſtimony which is humane, without a Revelation from God that what the Church did ſpeak, it did ſpeak from God. Therefore the church had it ſelf then towards Faith, as propoſing the matter, not as reſolving the aſſurance. And can we not then as well be now aſſured
<pb n="1027" facs="tcp:40740:468"/> that what the Scripture doth propoſe is the Word of God, as what the Church propoſed then was the Word of God? And ſo Faith muſt at length not only cauſe us to believe that what God ſaies is true, but alſo to believe that God hath ſaid this, therefore.</p>
            <p>He likes not then my reaſon for the ſubordination of the Church to Scripture, <hi>not for the reaſon againſt which other reaſons will ſoon be found.</hi> Anſ. This will require a very good intention, but thus he is pleaſed to put off my diſcourſe. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proves his propoſitions by Scripture, by reaſon, by Fathers. Therefore he makes his heads of proof, and holds of Faith. And another would ſay that my Adverſaries were beaten out of all their holds. He ſaies to my reaſon here, <hi>againſt it other reaſons will ſoon be found,</hi> when they are found we ſhall find anſwers. Let them tell me from whom the Church hath its authority: They will ſay from Chriſt, Well he is ſuppoſed the Author: But where is the Inſtrument and Patent for our knowledge that Chriſt hath paſſed ſuch a grant? The Church ſaith it, they will ſay. But firſt. The Church Univerſal doth not ſay it. Secondly, who of them hath proved that the Church is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they bear witneſs of themſelves, therefore their teſtimony is not true; not in <hi>modo,</hi> if it were true in <hi>materia.</hi> Thirdly, What the Church can ſay amounts but to a prudential motive, or congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inducement: but what is it which grounds Faith, and binds Faith, and makes it a divine belief, if not what is ſaid in Scripture? Without this what is the Church but a company of men in <hi>naturalibus.</hi> The Roman doth not ſo much believe this or that becauſe God ſaies it; but they believe God ſaies it, becauſe the Church ſaies it. But the Church virtual, in the Pope; Repreſentative, in a Council; diffuſive in the people, ſignifies nothing without religion. The queſtion then is, what religion makes the Church, which we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
<pb n="1028" facs="tcp:40740:469"/> Not reaſon ſatiſfies us in this, becauſe ſome principles of Religion do tranſcend reaſon; and becauſe reaſon cannot by its principles produce Faith of proper name: then we muſt have ſomwhat, which is ſuppoſed as a common principle, whereby true Religion is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Not the Church: For the queſtion is, which is the Church. What then, but Scripture? Let them then think upon the former Texts for ſufficiency of Scripture, which if they were acknowledged, would ſave us this diſpute. And let them think upon that Text, <hi>Eſa.</hi> the 8. the 20. <q>To the Law and to the Teſtimony: If they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</q> That, which is referred to another for direction, is ſubordinate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; The Church is referred to the Law, and to the Teſtimony: therefore it is ſubordinate. If they ſpeak not according to this word as written; it is becauſe there is no light in them.</p>
            <p>Another Text may be named; 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 
               <q>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but incorruptible; by the Word of God, which liveth, and abideth for ever.</q> So the Apoſtle, from whence we thus argue: That, which is begotten of the Word, is ſubordinate to it; the Church is begotten by the Word. Therefore their argument is retorted by the contrary; For the Word in the ſubſtance of it, muſt be before the Church; becauſe the Church is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the Word; therefore the Church muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Word, <q>which liveth, and abideth for ever:</q> and this better ſuits the ſtanding charracter of Scripture, than the looſe, and fluent, or fluxive way of Tradition. And how comes Tradition into the world? By the firſt Church, they will ſay. Well, and how came the firſt Church to be ſuch? What did they joyn together in the profeſſion of Religion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as ſome ſay the world came together by the caſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="1029" facs="tcp:40740:469"/> of <hi>Atoms?</hi> The firſt Church <hi>viritim</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottten by the Word through the Spirit; ſo in the <hi>ver.</hi> before, <q>ſeeing you have purified your ſouls in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth through the Spirit.</q> Then all is to be reſolved into the Word: <hi>quod eſt primum in generatione, eſt ultimum reſolutione.</hi> So <hi>Aquinas, Omne reducitur ad principium.</hi> All is to be reduced to the firſt principles. Therefore they will never reconcile St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> unleſs they admit my diſtinction of the Church: Then that which <hi>Frenaeus</hi> ſaith will well agree with that of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, as we commonly read it, the Church is the Pillar, and ground of truth: St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, the Scripture is the Pillar of truth. Both agree, for <hi>ſubordinata non pugnant. Subordinates</hi> make no warre.</p>
            <p>Let them not therefore tell me, that <hi>what God tells me by his Church I am to admit;</hi> this we admit: But let them tell me how I ſhall infallibly know, that he tells me ſo by the Church. And let them tell me how I ſhall know the Church, but by letters of credence, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture. How can I divine whether there is to be a Chureh, and which is the true Church, and which the true Religion, without Scripture? And <hi>Nemo tenetur derinare,</hi> as the ſaying. So that that, which he ſaies, <hi>that the Church is firſt believed independently on Scripture,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> neither upon Scripture, nor Catholick Church, nor reaſon. Take Scripture in the matter of it, and that which he ſaies hath no conſiſtency. In ſaving Religion there is nothing before it, not only in <hi>ſigno rationis,</hi> but alſo in time; becauſe the Church is begotten of the word of God. We deny not, that the Church is made uſe of to diſpoſe us to faith of Scripture; but this doth not reſolve us; becauſe it ſelf, of it ſelfe, reſolvs but into a moral capacity, which makes not faith properly called, not faith Divine, therefore in <hi>Genere Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> the firſt propoſition to the Church is, that the
<pb n="1030" facs="tcp:40740:470"/> Scripture is the word of God; and without its teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church, it cannot be ſaid to be credible in the ſenſe of divine faith. Therefore if he meanes that the <hi>Church is firſt believed independently on Scripture,</hi> namely upon the account of humane faith, we may grant it of the univerſal Church: but what is this to our purpoſe, ſince we are diſputing about faith divine? If he takes it of divine faith; this would be to purpoſe; but that it is not true.</p>
            <p>Yet he proceeds, <hi>So he that begins to be a Chriſtian cannot admit of Scripture as men admit of the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſciences.</hi> Anſ. Nor do we ſay ſo. Ordinarly he begins with prudential motives, from without he uſeth arguments drawn from out of Scripture; but the queſtion is whether theſe motives are productive of Faith in him. And he ſeems to ſay as much as de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſes it, becauſe he ſaies, <hi>in reſpect of us the Church is firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved independently of Scripture.</hi> So then, the way by the Church is imperfect, as the way of knowledge by thoſe things which are more known <hi>quoad nos.</hi> But in the way of Faith, which makes the aſſent more firm and certain, we muſt begin with Scripture upon which the Church depends. To joyn iſſue then, We at firſt lead men to the Faith of Scripture by the way of the Church, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were led to Chriſt by the voice of the woman. But Faith doth not reſt here; becauſe they who deny the Scripture may deny the Church, and may queſtion its credibility. Therefore ſince the Authority of the Church doth <hi>de ſe</hi> termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate its ſelf in the Teſtimony of men, we would have our Faith by ſuch a way as is proportionable to it, which if it be Faith divine, muſt rely upon ſome divine Authority. And this way the Scripture muſt be more known than the Church, becauſe by the Scripture we know the Church, in a diſtinct knowledge. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it can be no more than an <hi>Individuum vagum.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="1031" facs="tcp:40740:470"/> it is Scripture which makes <hi>Individuum demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrativum.</hi> And they are wont to prove it <hi>determinatum,</hi> as in <hi>Petrus,</hi> by the Scripture.</p>
            <p>And as for the Criticiſm in the forenamed Text of Scripture to <hi>Timothy</hi> about the Church; all he ſaies is nothing againſt ſo much uſe of it as I made. For I do not argue ſo, becauſe there are ſuch Ebraiſms, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is to be ſo expounded; we ſay it follows not as to an actual neceſſity of ſuch an interpretation: No; but thus it will follow, there are ſuch Hebrew formes of prefacing; therefore this may be ſo interpreted. Now the poſſibility of ſuch an expoſition is ſufficient to my purpoſe: For poſſibility of the Contrary ſtops the mouth of infallibility, If this or that be infallible, it is not poſſible to be any other way, but the ſenſe may be otherwiſe; therefore this is not the infallible ſenſe. ſo we agree with Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> whom he quotes; becauſe the Doctor may deny the argumentation as <hi>quoad eſſe;</hi> we intend it ſufficiently <hi>quoad poſſe.</hi> It may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expounded than they ſay; therefore cannot we hereby infallibly know this infallibility of the Church. Suppoſe the Church were infallible; yet if we did not infallibly know ſo much, we cannot make the Church our ground of Faith. Nor could there be any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of their implicit Faith, if they did not know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly that whatſoever the Church propounds is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            <p>And an exception againſt this interpretation is, that it is new, <hi>unheard of to all Antiquity and unto all men unto this age,</hi> Anſ. This exception would have come better from ſome other, ſince my adverſary had no minde to anſwer me to ſome Authority of the Antient. It were worth the while to quit the Criticiſm upon condition they would hold to antiquity. But whoſe ſaying was that, <hi>Omnes Patres ſic, ego autem non ſic?</hi> And yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this a ſufficient anſwer, unleſs the conſent of<pb n="1031" facs="tcp:40740:471"/> the Fathers could make a concluſion to be of faith. So then, as the <hi>Florentine</hi> ſaid of vertue, that the ſhew of it is profitable, but the practice not; ſo alſo may it be ſaid of the Italians, that the ſhew of antiquity is of uſe to them, but the thing not, but alſo it will be too hard for every one of them to prove a negative, neither were many of the Fathers Learned in the Hebrew tongue.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>whether this infallibility be equall to that of the Apoſtles, or not, maketh not to our purpoſe.</hi> Anſ. Surely infallibility never took any degrees with their Doctours. It is not <hi>receptive</hi> of <hi>magis, &amp; minus,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he aſſerts not an equall infallibility, he aſſerts none: leſs in infallibility is leſs then infallibility. So then their Church now is not ſuch as to rely upon, equally to the Authority of the Apoſtles; therefore it muſt be ſubordinate to Apoſtolical authority: which indeed was in effect confeſſed before in that he granted, that the Church was <hi>regula regulata.</hi> And this is as much, as the cauſe is worth</p>
            <p>He ſaies, I note him in a Parentheſis, for a <hi>French Catholicke, for allowing infallibility to the Pope defining with a Council.</hi> Anſ. No. He, or his ſcribe is much miſtaken. I asked him, whether he had a minde to the opinion of the French Catholick, becauſe he in one place ſpake of the infallible aſſiſtance of the Church without any mention of the Pope. Now if he did on purpoſe leave out the Pope in his account of infallibility, then he is like to be a French Catholick: And, although <hi>all Romane Catholicks allow infallibility to a Pope defining with a Council,</hi> cumulative; yet all Roman Catholicks do not allow infallibility to the Pope, only then when he defines with a Council. As ſome Catholicks do allow full Authority to a Council without a Pope: ſo ſome Catholicks allow infallible Authority to a Pope without a Council. And this is more then I needed to
<pb n="1033" facs="tcp:40740:471"/> have ſaid to him that ſales in this paragraph ſo little to me</p>
            <p>Yet he will charge me with charging him with an opinion which brings him within perill of blaſphemy, His opinion was this, <q>
                  <hi>God gives as much infallible aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Church in a Council, as he gave to him who did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his word in Scripture.</hi>
               </q> My reaſon was this, for herein it appears that now there is no need of Scripture, ſince God ſpeaks as infallibly by his Church as in his word. He denies the inference. I maintain the charge more preſſely thus. He that inferres no need of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes within perill of blaſphemie. He that ſaies ſuch words as before infers no need of Scripture, Therefore, To the major in effect he hath ſaid nothing, his diſcourſe is bent againſt the matter of the minor; and he would deny it by ſeverall inſtances, which come not up to the caſe in hand. Firſt becauſe <hi>he ſpeaks infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the Church of the Law of nature for two thouſand yeares.</hi> And <hi>why more blaſphemy</hi> now? To this in the matter of it we have ſpoken before. As applied here, we ſhall anſwer to it now. Firſt he did not then ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly by his Church, if the termes [by his Church] be meant reduplicatively to whatſoever was ſaid by his Church: if it be underſtood thus, that whatſoever truth was propoſed by God was propoſed by the Church; it may be more eaſily granted. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe the reaſon were good if it were true, in the latter it may be ſuppoſed true, yet it is not ſufficient to his uſe, who urgeth that nothing is propoſed by the Church but that which is true and from God. Yea 2. it cannot be abſolutly granted in the ſecond ſenſe, if we take the Church to have ſpoken from God in any way of a Council: for much truth of what was propo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed, came to ſome, of them by way of prophecy. 3. The termes [God ſpeak infallibly by his Church] may relate more ſtrictly to the Agent or to the Inſtrument,
<pb n="1034" facs="tcp:40740:472"/> God ſpake infallibly whatſoever he ſpake by them: but God did not ſpeak infallibly by them whatſoever they ſaid. Or thus, the words are true hypothetically, if God ſpake, he ſpake infallibly by them; for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak otherwiſe: but that whatſoever they ſaid was ſpoken to them infallibly by God, is a queſtion. Yea 4. Will they think that there is as much reaſon for infallible ſpeaking by the Church when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Canon is compleated, as when there was none? As to Gods ſpeaking by Moſes, we have ſpoken to it laſtly. As to Gods ſpeaking to ſome Gentiles by the Church; that was not ordinary; and therefore it fits not our caſe, neither can they prove that the faith of the Gentiles was not wrought in them by the efficiencie of the ſpirit of God, notwithſtanding they had the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their faith from the Church. Neither is it now the ſame caſe of teaching us infallibly by the Church as at the time when the Apoſtles <hi>did write;</hi> becauſe the Chriſtian Church was then to be ſettled upon the foundation of the Apoſtles as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks: and now the building can ſtand upon that foundation, therefore were they extraordinary officers and laſted but for a time. And yet if they, can prove that their Church-doctrine is no other then that which was Apoſtolical, or that thoſe who bring new doctrine are as well inſpired as the Apoſtles, the Roman Church ſhall now be Apoſtolical. And if there were now as great a neceſſity of the infallible direction of the Church as there was in the times of the Apoſtles by them, then why ſhould not the Apoſtolical office have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the number of twelve, and ſo all the Apoſtles ſhould have had ſucceſſours? which they muſt not ſay who maintain the Monarchy of the Church</p>
            <p>Neither doth that inſtance of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>as</hi> which alſo the Scripture teacheth, come up to the caſe. Firſt, Becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was but
<pb n="1035" facs="tcp:40740:472"/> a ſingular perſon; but the Church now is conſidered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a promiſe of continual ſucceſſion, and as is pretended by them, with the perpetual gift of infallibility; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though there was Scripture then beſides <hi>Iohns</hi> Teſtimony, yet what need of it now, if there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant infallibility in the Church? Secondly, There is a difference in the caſe <hi>ex parte Scripturae,</hi> in regard o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Scripture, which was not then compleated; therefore there might be more neceſſity of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Teſtimony, and of the voice from heaven, and of the Teſtimony of miracles: But now the Canon is conſigned, what need of the infallible direction of the Church; and if there be an infallible direction ſtanding in the Church, what need of a ſtanding rule? it may ſerve for a <hi>commoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium,</hi> as the Cardinal. So the Scripture ſhall give us but an application of the Churches doctrine. The Scripture that muſt not be a ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ficient rule; the Church that is the direct and plain way that fools cannot erre. They may erre by the Scripture; they cannot erre by the Church. Therefore in effect, not only will there be no need of Scripture, but there would be need of none. But more cloſely, That which is not of uſe without the Church, and that which the Church may be without, is not neceſſary. The Scripture is of no uſe without the Church; and the Church may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture: Therefore, according to their premiſes, the Scripture ſhould not be neceſſary; and how farre is it from blaſphemy, to ſay that the Scripture is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary? If to accuſe Scripture be to accuſe God, as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> before, Then to ſay there was no need of Scripture, is to accuſe God of inſpiring ſo many Pen-men, for no neceſſary purpoſe. For although after all means of Faith <hi>ſtill millions do not believe,</hi> as he ſaies; yet ſince, according to their doctrine, no ſenſe of Scripture in point of Faith is to be believed, but as taken from the Church; ſince the Word not written takes up ſo much
<pb n="1036" facs="tcp:40740:473"/> of neceſſary matter; ſince the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tfecter and the wiſer are to be ſublimated by Traditions; ſince the common people are not to be converſant in Scripture in a knowen tongue, what neceſſary purpoſe doth the Scripture ſerve to? It is true, <hi>ſuperflua non nocent,</hi> as the rule is; and <hi>Utile per inutile non vitiatur;</hi> true: But yet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> according to their principles, the Scripture will be ſuperfluous. For that which is more than is neceſſary is not neceſſary; that which is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary what is it? Therefore if any of their men ſhould be found to be <hi>traditores Bibliorum,</hi> as ſome were of old, the Roman Donatiſts would never make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from them.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>The Church is not more Enthuſiaſtical now than ſhe was for four thouſand years, before ſhe had all the promiſes, which Chriſt made her of an aſſiſtance, which ſhould be at leaſt as ſpeacill and full as ſhe ever had before;</hi> Anſ. This is poſitively no anſwer, but ſomewhat by compare, we preſs it. The Church in that time did not <hi>de communi,</hi> challenge immediate inſpiration: therefore that Church which doth ſo now is more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical. Secondly, It is a begging of the queſtion ſince there is not now that need after the Canon is compleated. Thirdly, We return them their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what aſſiſtance the Church had formerly, it hath now; the Church formerly had not <hi>de communi,</hi> in fallible aſſiſtance: therefore not now. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the Apoſtles and the writers of the Scripture are not rationally to be included in the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Church, in our caſe. Let them chuſe which they will ſtand to. If they put them into the promiſcuous account of the Church, let them now ſhew us ſuch a Church: If they account them extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, let them ſhew ordinarily ſuch.</p>
            <p>And he confounds himſelf in what follows. <hi>Before ſhe delivered only what ſhe had received by tradition and by
<pb n="1037" facs="tcp:40740:473"/> Scripture.</hi> She hath received Scripture by Tradition too; hath ſhe not? Why doth he then divide Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Tradition in the way of its coming to us? For the chief reckoning they make to us of Scripture is upon the credit of Tradition. But he means Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ex parte materiae,</hi> it may be; becauſe they think Tradition conteins other matter than Scripture equally to be believed. But this is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>In Interpreting which (according to the ſenſe truly intended by the Holy Ghoſt) the ſame Holy Ghoſt doth aſſiſt her, ſo that here is no new Revelation claimed to be made to her, but an infallible aſſiſtance to propoſe faithfully what was formerly revealed.</hi> Anſ. He cannot well clear himſelf of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm upon the account of Tradition. Any thing beſide the word written equally to be believed is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Enthuſiaſm: But they pretend ſomewhat beſide the word written equally to be believed; therefore are they in danger of Enthuſiaſm. And I do not ſee well how they can anſwer it. But now he endeavours to purge himſelf of this accuſation in point of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scripture. They ſay they do not interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by revelation but by infallible aſſiſtance. Well, But how ſhall we blind ſouls be aſſured infallibly of this infallible aſſiſtance? We may not examine it by the judgment of private diſcretion; may we? If we may, then this is gained. Muſt we believe it? Yes. Why? Becauſe God hath it to be his will that we ſhould abſolutely believe the Church. Shew me where. By the Church? that is in queſtion. By the Scriptures? what Texts? Thoſe produced. But the queſtion is whether they are rightly interpreted <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true ſenſe.</hi> What will they ſay now? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Church hath infallible aſſiſtance. And this they muſt believe by a revelation without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this is an Enthuſiaſm. And the Roman church pretending this priviledge above other Church's
<pb n="1038" facs="tcp:40740:474"/> makes it a private revelation. Again, though there are ſeveral waies of revelation, yet I would aske how many waies there are of infallible aſſiſtance diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from revelation: let them tell us or elſe conclude againſt themſelves that they muſt have the ſenſe of Scripture interpreted by revelation, becauſe by infallible aſſiſtance. The pen-men of Scripture they had infallible aſſiſtance: but that was by revelation. Let us know what infallible aſſiſtance there is without a revelation: ſpecially ſince <hi>Stapelton</hi> and ſome others likely will have the definitions of Councils to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical. If they be concluded by diſcourſe, then are they fallible: if their concluſions be prophetical, then by revelation.</p>
            <p>But alſo theſe terms [to propoſe faithfully what was formerly revealed] are ſomewhat obſcurely propoſed. Doth he mean it of the ſenſe of Scripture? Then where was it <hi>formerly revealed?</hi> if it was clearely revealed, what need of a Council to ſee that which others may ſee? if not, how was the ſenſe revealed to them infallibly without a revelation? If he meanes [what was formerly revealed] of Traditions; thoſe are beſide the word of God: and therefore theſe do not belong to interpreting of Scripture. And yet alſo the Church hath not been ſo faithful in propoſing theſe; as hath been noted before. Or doth he mean it of traditive interpretations, as they are called? but where are theſe to be found? who gives us their number formal and material?</p>
            <p>Let them then take home to their own Tents thoſe that <hi>claim full aſſurance by the ſpirit in any point.</hi> We differ from them much; firſt becauſe we doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any ſuch neceſſity of ful aſſurance in every point: but the Roman muſt; otherwiſe what need of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible living Judge? 2. We pretend not to any praerogative above other Churches as to the knowing
<pb n="1039" facs="tcp:40740:474"/> the ſenſe of Scripture; they do. Therefore they urge that of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in alluſion to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Church of the Romans then, for their Church now, that perfidiouſneſs cannot have acceſſe to them; not conſidering (beſides what hath been ſaid to it before) what <hi>Nilus</hi> comments upon it, that the Apoſtle ſpoke it of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the time that was paſt, not of the future. And thirdly, we do uſe meanes towards the finding out the true ſenſe: but they muſt have it by an extraordinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit (which needs not means) if they will have it by infallible aſſiſtance in places of controverſie. Therefore <hi>Stapleton</hi> thinks rationally that concluſions from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, cannot be infallble; and therefore he will have them to be Prophetical: and that will be by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
            <p>This number receives again my reinforcements of my anſwer to that Text forenamed about the Church, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> as we ordinarily read it. I ſaid it reſpects the office of the Church, according to the rule of the School-man. He ſaies again, No, it reſpects the Authority. And here he does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for he offers no reaſon why it ſhould be taken in his way. For as to that which he urgeth here that it is called the <hi>ground of truth,</hi> it is not ſolidly objected; for the term in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that which is to keep firm and ſtable; the prop, the ſupport, and this fairly imports an act <hi>ex officio,</hi> to keep up, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the truth.</p>
            <p>He ſaies alſo it ſuits well with his ſenſe to give order to <hi>Timothy</hi> to carry himſelf well, that the Church might be thought to be infallible, <hi>ſo as not to make men believe it improbable that God ſhould aſſiſt infallibly ſuch a Church.</hi> Anſ. The ſtrength of this Argument him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſtroies. He is afraid to make good life an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of infallibility; becauſe he ſaies it is a pitiful
<pb n="1040" facs="tcp:40740:475"/> 
               <hi>argument, ſince</hi> Solomon <hi>the Idolaters was aſſiſted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi> Well, But let them firſt take my ſenſe with the rule of the School-men, and ſo compare them with his reaſon, which is but <hi>a pitiful argument;</hi> and then judge whether it be not beſt to take my account upon the place. Secondly, If badneſs of life be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to infallibility, then, ſince they cannot deny that ſome of their chief Paſtours have been in life <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> their infallibility will be ſcandalized, and ſo cannot be ſuch a way as that <hi>fools cannot erre,</hi> as he urged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Thirdly, If this ſatisfies the <hi>multitude,</hi> that thoſe who are to inſtruct them are of unblamable life: yet this though it be enough <hi>ad faciendum populum;</hi> yet this is not enough to judicious men, who look for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction upon ſolid principles; nor can this make Faith unto the people of their infallibility, but a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof. Fourthly, As for Biſhops and Deacons, which he ſaies ſhould be ſo qualified (by the order of St <hi>Paul,</hi> to and for <hi>the credit of ſuch a Church</hi>) he does not there find in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle any Cardinal Biſhop; or Cardinal Presbyter, or Cardinal Deacon, in whom the power of infallibility, according to them, ſhould chieflly conſiſt; and therefore that Text doth not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſerve their turn. Fiftly, I had thought infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility could have defended it ſelf without the credit of a good life; ſince the grace of gifts, and the gift of grace are two things.</p>
            <p>I ſaid moreover what need of ſuch inſtructions which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to <hi>Timothy,</hi> if the Church were infallible, ſince infallible aſſiſtance is immediate. He anſwers here, this is a <hi>ſtrange conſequence;</hi> the Church is infallible in <hi>defending points in a general Council,</hi> Ergo, <hi>no man needeth inſtructions for his private good behaviour.</hi> Anſ. But firſt, the inſtructions he gives to <hi>Timothy,</hi> were ſuch as reſpected him in his place for the ordering of the Church in <hi>rebus fidei,</hi> in
<pb n="1041" facs="tcp:40740:475"/> matters of Faith, as appears by the ſumme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine which he gave him, <q>
                  <hi>Great is the</hi> myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of godlineſs, &amp;c. Secondly.</q> By my Adverſaries opinion there was no ſuch need of inſtructions for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, ſince it is a <hi>pitiful argument</hi> to derogate from infallibility by a bad life. Thirdly, Neither was <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> I hope in their account, a <hi>private</hi> man.</p>
            <p>After this he hath two queſtions in the clouds. <hi>Was it ſo for the firſt two thouſand yeares before the Scripture was written.</hi> Anſ. This is imediately ſubjoyned to the other before; and therefore ſhould ſeeme to be univocal to it. And then we ſay two things, firſt he ſuppoſeth that which is to be proved, that the Church, in that ſpace, was abſolutely infallible. 2. much leſs was it infallible in Councils, as he now pretends, which then were not, as he now would have them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from hence it ſhould follow, that if the Church be infallible, it may be infallible without Councils; and this is againſt him. Another queſtion is this. <hi>Or do we perhaps teach this infallible aſſiſtance to be communicated to every one immediately?</hi> Anſ. He ſpeakes gravely, as antient men were wont, with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as he notes in his Rhetoriques. But why ſhould he think we think he doe? For the Church, by him, might be thought to be infallible; though <hi>Timothy</hi> was not; becauſe according to him, infallibility is in a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. And though <hi>Timothy</hi> might have been Preſident of a Council, yet was he not to be (according to my Adverſary) perſonally infallible, but as Head of the Council. Yea he could not be Head of a Council then; for this was, according to my adverſaries, reſerved for St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And yet <hi>infallible aſſiſtance</hi> was <hi>communicated to every</hi> of the Apoſtles; was it not? Then nothing hinders but that it may be communicated to every of the Popes ſucceſſively; which yet, it may be, he declines the affirmation of. And if it be not communicated to
<pb n="1042" facs="tcp:40740:476"/> every of the Preiſts how ſhall the people be ſecured from errour by them, ſo as they cannot erre?</p>
            <p>But if they do ſay <hi>infallible aſſiſtance</hi> is <hi>communicated</hi> to any <hi>immediately,</hi> then may they ſee reaſon for what I ſaid that <hi>infallible aſſiſtance is immediate:</hi> or if all infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance be not imediate, let them ſhew another ſpecies of infallible aſſiſtance. To me this argument is good, Apoſtolical aſſiſtance was immediate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance is Apoſtolical, therefore infallible aſſiſtance is immediate. No queſtion is made of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Nor can they make any doubt of the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they urge as much aſſiſtance to the Church now as is Apoſtolical. Therefore had my Adverſary reaſon to interpret me of ſuch infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which needs no inſtructions: for I know no infallible aſſiſtance that doth, as appeares by the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Neither doth his following Inſtance of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Council in the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts</hi> evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Though their determinations were not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſpired in regard of time, or of debate: Yet ſince this debate was not to them neceſſary, how can this make a new ſpecies of infallible aſſiſtance? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore this Council was in this ſort managed by them to be a precedent and example to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which ſhould not have infallible aſſiſtance, to determin preſently and prophetically as ſoon as the queſtion is propoſed. And if thoſe who have infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance do uſe diſcourſe; this doth not conclude an infallible aſſiſtance, which is not immediate. He that can prove the creation of the world by principles of Scripture in way of Faith, or in order to Faith, may prove the ſame concluſion alſo by principles of reaſon in order to ſcience.</p>
            <p>But then it is ſaid in the preface, <hi>it hath ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us.</hi> Anſ. To this I ſay, <hi>fine
<pb n="1043" facs="tcp:40740:476"/> praejudicio melioris ſententiae,</hi> that theſe words do not cogently inferr an infallible aſſiſtance of proper name, actuated, for they may bear that account in reſpect to the diſcourſe they made by the effects of the Holy Ghoſt, and former declarations. And this may appear by that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 17. <hi>vlt.</hi> 
               <q>ſhe is happier if ſhe ſo abide according to my judgment; and I think alſo that I have the ſpirit of God.</q> This judgment was not given by infallible aſſiſtance, becauſe by no inſpiration: and yet alſo it doth refer to the ſpirit of God: <q>And according to this proportion might be ſaid, it hath ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us; and yet thoſe concluſions might not proceed from the Holy Ghoſt by way of infallible aſſiſtance.</q> And ſo farr in other Councils the definitions may be ſaid to be by the Holy Ghoſt, as they are drawn out of principles of Scripture, which the Holy Ghoſt did inſpire the Pen-men of it in. Yea 2. Since the meeting of them in that Council was but upon convenience in caſe of Scandal, what ſuch neceſſity was there for that infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt? So then let them take it how they will, either thoſe determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not made by them who were infallible by an infallible aſſiſtance; and then is not this inſtance to their purpoſe: or if it was, then are they to prove equall aſſiſtance to all General Councils: otherwiſe extraordinaries make no ſpecies. And I am ſure the <hi>Trent</hi> Council hath not credited ſuch aſſiſtance, as <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would claim from the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Council to all General Councils.<note place="margin">N. 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Here he would make up the breach which was made upon his ſtrong hold for infallibility in Councils by that place of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as holding the conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality of the Son of God to be <hi>the word of God</hi> upon the Authority of the Council. This was ſlighted. He would repair it, but it will not ſtand. That Text,
<pb n="1044" facs="tcp:40740:477"/> upon which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council builded their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is made good <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>num</hi> 4. In the judgment of the Council it did more then <hi>probably</hi> determin the Controverſie. And if he thinks otherwiſe, he doth not believe the Council; and therefore not their infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. His diſcourſe is nothing: He cannot determin it Gods word <hi>with relation to a Text probable in Scripture, therefore he doth it with relation to the infallibility of the Councils authority.</hi> Well, is here all? then turne the tables, He cannot determin it Gods will with relation to the infallibility of the Councils Authority; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for he did it with relation to the infallible Authority of Scripture, Doth he ſay that the Council holdes it upon account of their Authority, or of the Scripture? then which is it more likely it ſhould be held upon? The Church, or the Scripture? But let them ſpeake thus, when the queſtion is granted.</p>
            <p>Another anſwer of mine he doth as good as confeſs, that St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did not hold it upon the Council; becauſe he held it before. Here he diſtinguiſheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. He held it <hi>ſo in order to himſelf who was convinced that his interpretation was conformable to the antient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Church, yet in order to others</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. He was not Pope, was he? And yet St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks ſo highly of him, as if he had ſpoken ſo of the Pope, we ſhould have heard of it: but if he was not Pope, what have we to do to the holding it in order to others? He was quoted for his own judgment; was he not? Then this diſtinction is impertinent. And beſides, if he was <hi>convinced that his interpretation was conformable to the antient doctrine of the Church,</hi> he was convinced that their doctrine was conformable to the true ſenſe of Scripture; if not, why ſhould he ſay that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil urged Scripture to the <hi>Arrians?</hi> if he was, then he held it before upon that account.</p>
            <p>Then again he toucheth upon the Council of <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
               <pb n="1045" facs="tcp:40740:477"/> ſaying that I contend that <hi>Council as well to be believed for it ſelf as the Council of Nice, and you think</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. what I ſpake by way of interrogation [why not] is not yet anſwered by him in the reaſon of it. He wonders that I ſhould urge this Council in way of compare to the contrary: But this gives no ſatisfaction as to my reaſon, that exceptions, it ſeemes, were not ſo availeable againſt the Council, becauſe St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> made no mention of them, but referred the point betwixt them to Scripture. This Council of <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> was not ſo eſteemed as the reſt: but what then? from whence did this diſeſteem proceed? from the illegality? it ſeems no; for then St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had had a plea againſt it without waving the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. And ſurely St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had a very mean eſteem of the Authority even of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, if having a juſt exception againſt the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> he would not pleade it, and ſo bring in the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> againſt the <hi>Arrians.</hi> But it may be the <hi>Arrians</hi> did not care for the Authority of a Council, and therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> waved the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. Yea? Then how is the Authority of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil a Catholick remedy? and then it ſeemes the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers determined againſt them, not by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which they cared not for, but by the Scripture. So then the diſteem of that Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> was upon reſpect to the matter of the definitions. And ſo a Council was not in their opinion, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> infallible. Therefore he procceds in a fallacy, if he argues thus, <hi>it was never by the Fathers, no nor by the Church of England numbred amongſt the foure firſt Councils,</hi> therefore it was rejected, becauſe it was not accounted a lawful Council. Becauſe it was rejected, therefore for this cauſe, doth not follow: becauſe the <hi>genus</hi> doth contein potentially more ſpecies. It was refuſed upon diſlike of the matter, it ſeemes, as before. And as for the reaſon why it was
<pb n="1046" facs="tcp:40740:478"/> not lawful, he toucheth not here; and it was caſhier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>and you might as well thinke that I might prevaile againſt you by only citing the Council of Trent</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. ſurely the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> in all reſpects conſiderable was as hopeful towards infallibility as the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> it may be more, by a a greater number of Biſhops; and this with my adverſary ſhould have borne ſome weight; who ſhould think that multitude of Counſellours is halfe an argument of truth; becauſe he would not place infallibility in a ſingular perſon, as the Jeſuit, but in a Council with the Pope. And if he ſaies that there was wanting in the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> the preſence or conſent of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> we can eaſily anſwer, that he then had but a ſingle ſuffrage, and there were ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Biſhops more in the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> then were at the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Yea alſo, ſome Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> proceeded without the Pope's confirmation, as before. But I think they are both alike, the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> in being deceived. Only I think that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had leſs to ſay againſt the illegality of the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> then we have to ſay againſt the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> And therefore we may follow St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and if he appealed from the Council of <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> to Scripture, we may as well appeal from that of <hi>Trent,</hi> if they would urge it. He ſaies St. <hi>Auſtin in vaine had inſiſted upon the Nicene Council againſt one who ſcoffed at it.</hi> Anſ. Me thinkes, if I may ſay ſo, this is not very judiciouſly ſpoken; becauſe, if <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iminus</hi> urged the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> he was bound by equall law to be dealt with by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. If <hi>Maximinus</hi> had not urged the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> it had ſeemed that the <hi>Arrian</hi> had not a perſwaſion that this Controverſie ſhould be otherwiſe handled then by
<pb n="1047" facs="tcp:40740:478"/> Scripture. And if he were <hi>well furniſhed with other arguments out of Scripture admitted by him,</hi> as he it ſeemes ſuppoſeth that he might be, what need then of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church in Councils? And it ſeemes it is the ſhorter way and more expedite againſt Hereticks by Scripture, as he confeſſeth in the words following, <hi>that St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>intended by them only at that time to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him and not to medle with a long contention (fit to fill a book alone) aboue the validity of the Council of Nice and invalidity of that of Ariminum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Put then theſe things together; St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> it ſeemes might be ſufficiently furniſhed with arguments out of Scripture againſt the <hi>Arrian;</hi> he might by them only overthrow him; it is a voluminous work to prove the legality of one Council, and the illegality of another; the <hi>Arrian</hi> ſcoffed at the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> therefore the convenient and eaſie way of proceeding with and againſt Hereticks is by Scripture, not by the Authority of the Church. And this <hi>interpretative</hi> is the yeilding of the cauſe. And yet, if they will yet think Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, as ſuch, to be infallible, let them think upon that Canon of <hi>Nice</hi> declaring equal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> and let them think of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſhould be equal in his limits to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> The Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in their Epiſtle to <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were of equal dignity. Let them therefore conſider well what they have to do; for, if Councils be not infallible, they are in an errour: if Councils be infallible, they are not, becauſe they have declared againſt them. Let them therefore ſtand on fall by Scripture. Let them try it ſo as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did.<note place="margin">N. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>His diſcourſe herein is fully put into this form, all errours in or againſt things neceſſary are plainely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Scripture, This infallibility of the Church
<pb n="1048" facs="tcp:40740:479"/> is not plainly determined againſt by Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But <hi>therefore</hi> what? That this is no errour? Nay, that is not rightly concluded, but, that it is not an errour in things neceſſary. All errours are not in things neceſſary. Therefore if it concludes as it ſhould, it is peccant in the ignorance of the Elench; for it is enough to us that it be an errour, ſuppoſe it were not an errour in things neceſſary. If it concludes that therefore it is no errour, it concludes falſly. 2. Though the propoſition be our doctrine, the aſſumption ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that which is not neceſſary to be granted by us, that this infallibility of the Church is an errour in things neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we do not deny it to be ſo: but we are not by any arguments conſtrained to ſay ſo. For though we ſhould not hold it an errour in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet is it neceſſary to reject it as an errour, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be ſo. And 3. We ſay to the aſſumption, that it is ſufficiently enough determined againſt by Scripture namely as neceſſary to be in the Church, becauſe in the Scripture ſufficiency to ſalvation is aſſerted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; as before. And 4. The affirmative ſhould have been proved by them who aſſert it; not the negative to be proved by us. And as towards his proof of the aſſumption, that the <hi>Scripture is not ſo clear againſt this as for this,</hi> we have nothing to ſay, becauſe he hath nothing to prove it; <hi>Scaurus nega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> it beggs. And we can ſay better we have proved the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 29.</note>Here he reſumes a Text for them, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. <hi>vlt.</hi> I made anſwer to it before, that it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend equall aſſiſtance to all ages of the Church. He now urgeth me to ſhew a Text, wherein the aſſiſtance which was infallible in the <hi>firſt age,</hi> ſhould not be for the Second or Third age; he ſaies to me, <hi>againſt your reaſons we have our reaſons.</hi> Anſ. He is here wanting in two offices, firſt in proving that that Text doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend equal aſſiſtance to all ages of the Church; for
<pb n="1049" facs="tcp:40740:479"/> which the reſpondent is to waite with his buckler, it is enough to us that he cannot or does not prove it. But then 2. He is wanting in another thing becauſe he doth not produce his reaſons againſt our reaſons, let them draw the Sword and cut the knots if they cannot unty them. Let them <hi>bring forth their ſtrong reaſons,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeakes. When as then he ſaies, <hi>bring againſt my illimited Text another Text</hi> limiting, we ſay that the cauſe and our office is upon the negative until he brings another Text for his ſenſe, or gives reaſon for it, or gives us the conſent of all ages of the Church, we have nothing more to thinke (beſides what hath been ſaid) then that he had reaſon to ſay more, then what follows, <hi>the neceſſity of the people (which was the prime reaſon why Chriſt gave this infalliblity) was greater in ages remoter from Chriſt.</hi> But this was anſwered to by retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that then, Traditions, it ſeemes, now are not to be accounted equally certain. And he anſwers now that which he had better have kept in, He ſaies now, <hi>it is harder to prove now that Chriſt did ſuch miracles, was crucified, did riſe again, then it was preſently after theſe thinges happened; yet all theſe things be as infallibly true now as they were then, and as infallible: ſo I ſay of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; which for all this doe not loſe a ſufficient meaſure of infallible certainty.</hi> Anſ, Traditions then were but equall to Scripture, Traditions now are not equall to Traditions then. Therefore they are not now equall to Scripture. And this ſpoyles their Traditions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, which determins that they are to be received <hi>Pari pietatis affectu.</hi> And ſo hath he loſt his hold of Traditions by his own words. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it ſave him to ſay that they are now as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as then in themſelves but not to us; for ſo is the Scripture infallible in it ſelf without the Church, as they confeſs, but it doth not ſo appear to us, they ſay. 2. They are to make good, if they can, degrees of
<pb n="1050" facs="tcp:40740:480"/> infallible aſſiſtance, by the leaſt degree of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>But to goe on, <hi>what if there be no ſuch neceſſity</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. He ſeemes to be, towards a <hi>punctum reflexionis</hi> here, well, if there be no ſuch neceſſity of equall aſſiſtance, then my anſwer to ſuch Texts is the better. And then let them take the rule, which their own do uſe, <hi>Deus non deficit in neceſſaris, nec abundat in ſuperfluis.</hi> God doth not abound in things ſuperfluous, nor is wanting in things neceſſary. But then alſo if it be not neceſſary, why have my adverſaries ſo much pleaded the neceſſity of an infallible judge? Indeed it might be, if God had pleaſed; and yet not neceſſary by neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent; but they are wont to prove it to be, becauſe it is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>Did not the Church alone ſerve to decide all controverſies before the Scripture was written</hi> &amp;c. We anſwer as often before; The Church is not thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded infallible; put it into forme, that which decides all controverſies is infallible; the Church, before Scripture was written, did decide all controverſies; Therefore it is infallible? No. We firſt deny the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. That which decides all controverſies decides them infallibly, does not follow. This cannot be proved; leſs will not ſerve them. Then 2. To the aſſumption, we can deny it, it did not decide all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, put caſe it did decide all neceſſary contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, yet not all controverſies. And we muſt have a judge, they ſay to decide all controverſies whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And 3. If the Church then before Scripture was written did decide all controverſies whatſoever, then ſurely there is not that aſſiſtance infallible now given to the Roman Church, becauſe notwithſtanding they have the Scripture and Traditions, yet they cannot decide all controverſies. If they can, they are not faithfull, and then that of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is not due to
<pb n="1051" facs="tcp:40740:480"/> them now, that <hi>perfidia non poteſt habere acceſſum.</hi> If they cannot, where is the equall aſſiſtance? and then alſo what was decided by the Church was decided by the Scripture in the ſubſtance of it though not then written: ſo that he had no cauſe to contradiſtinguiſh this deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the controverſies to the uſe of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again</hi> he ſaies, <hi>did not the old Scripture teſtifie as much as was neceſſary that Ieſus Chriſt was the true Meſſias? Yes. to what end then was</hi> Iohn <hi>Baptiſt ſent to teſtifie this?</hi> Anſ. Firſt if the old Scripture did ſufficiently teſtifie of the Meſſias, then that which I have ſaid concerning the ſufficiency of the whole Canon is ſurely ſufficient: if it did not ſufficiently teſtifie, then his argument is none. 2. There is not <hi>par ratio</hi> for the adding infallibility to the Church after the Canon is conſigned, as for St. <hi>Iohns</hi> teſtimony notwithſtanding the old Scripture: More might be requiſit for the ſettling of the Primitive Church then after: becauſe the Church after was to be grounded in the Primitive.</p>
            <p>But he ſaies there is as good reaſon; <hi>In ages after the firſt when the Church ſhould grow from a grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed</hi> &amp;c. This proves nothing unleſs there might ariſe ſuch a controverſie which could not upon Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be decided without an infallible Judge. Let them prove this, and they will ſay ſomthing. If not, this will not be to the purpoſe, that ſeveral <hi>controverſies</hi> in ſuch a ſpace might ariſe. And would not the ſame number of neceſſary points, material and formal ſerve as many more thouſands of Chriſtians? And thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which he names, we have ſpoken to, nay when they have, as they ſuppoſe, an infallible Judge, are all controverſies ended? Let them bethink themſelves what differences amongſt them are yet dependent as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: We waite therefore for the proof of ſuch a promiſe of <hi>aſſiſtance extended to infallibility for other ages of the Church.</hi> It is not enough for him to ſay, <hi>why might not
<pb n="1052" facs="tcp:40740:481"/> Chriſt (for any thing you know) thinke this a ſufficient reaſon.</hi> A <hi>poſſe</hi> in the premiſes will not make an actuality in the concluſion. 2. there is a difference betwixt a reaſon after the thing is apparent, and a reaſon to prove the thing to be: if they can ſoundly prove to us that there is ſuch an aſſiſtance given in promiſe to the Church in all ages, then we ſhould ſooner be induced to the acknowledgment of his reaſon. But there is nothing in the reaſon till the reaſon prove the thing. 3. If words in Scripture were to be taken allwaies ſimply according to the termes, what need would there then be of an infallible Judge of the ſenſe of Scripture? Therefore let them chuſe which they will do, whether they will allwaies have Scripture meant according to the uppermoſt import of the letter; if ſo, then the ſenſe of Scripture is plain; which they have denied; if not, then may they admit a limitation of that aſſiſtance ſpoken of <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.3. This forme of modality [why might not] ſhould not, one would think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the high mode of infallible aſſiſtance. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech might ſerve us againſt their infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: but no ſpeech ſerves infallibility but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all thoſe teſtimonies were given to the Iewes as ill as they were diſpoſed.</hi> Anſ. he ſeemes to miſtake what I ſaid formerly about indiſpoſition to receive infallibility. For I ſpoke of it in order to thoſe who ſhould receive the gift of it for the Church, and he now ſeems to ſpeake of it in order to the people. But 2. Suppoſe there were as good a diſpoſition, the poſſibility hereof cannot conclude the ſame neceſſity of the ſame aſſiſtance, and ſome of their men are named by ſome of ours for denying any ſuch diſpoſition towards ſuch a meaſure of the ſpirit as formerly was given.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Scripture hath ſtill the ſame certainty,</hi> he ſaies categorically, <hi>is apparently falſe;</hi> ſpeaking as you
<pb n="1053" facs="tcp:40740:481"/> ſpeake in order to aſſure us &amp;c. Anſ. All his reaſons are invalid. For as for the firſt that I confeſs ſome books of Scripture were formerly not acknowledged by all which now are received, this is of no weight; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſufficient to my diſcourſe that they have ſtill the ſame certainty from the time of their general recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And 2. They have in themſelves allwaies the ſame credibility, as well as his Traditions, as he hath noted before.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>many and a good many books of Scripture are quite loſt,</hi> is firſt, in thoſe termes at leaſt, a ſuppoſition. Whether any be loſt is yet work for <hi>Tiſhbi,</hi> ſpecially whether many, much more whether a good many, but it is obvious to a Romaniſt that denies the Scripture to be ſufficient, to find it imperfect in the matter. In inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity he ſhould have ſaid nothing herein, leſt he ſhould be interpreted for his own ends. As the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who denies Chriſts ſatisfaction, to prove his opinion denies Chriſt's Divinity, that ſo the ſatisfaction ſhould not be ſufficient: ſo the Romaniſt, leſt the Scripture ſhould be thought to be a ſufficient rule, ſaies a good part of it is loſt. Thus with their honeſty they have loſt their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. Secondly, let them again conſider how much prejudice comes to their Church (which they ſay is the depoſitary of Chriſtian Doctrine) upon the loſs of a <hi>good many books of Scripture.</hi> Thirdly yet <hi>dato, non conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> ſuppoſe ſo, yet that which doth remain is ſurely as ſufficient as the old Scripture without all the new. Fourthly my words do not engage me in this debate, becauſe they are of a capacity to be underſtood of that Scripture which doth remain. Fifthly, If any be loſt, me thinks as the <hi>Sibills</hi> books, the reſt ſhould bear a better price. And as to his other exceptions about the ſenſe of Scripture, about the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, or of Baptiſm, whether to Infants, <hi>or to be a Prieſt or a Biſhop was to have power to ſacrifice or abſolve or not,</hi>
               <pb n="1054" facs="tcp:40740:482"/> we ſay firſt, that we have ſaid enough already. And we ſay, that we need not ſay any more in theſe points, till they make good theſe poſtulates. Firſt whether the exact knowledge of theſe points be neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, whether, if not, they can yet prove an infallible Judge in all points of controverſie appointed to us by God. And as to the laſt, they are firſt to prove a real ſacrifice in the time of the Goſpel, otherwiſe there will be no object for a ſpecial act of a Prieſt, as ſuch. And abſolution ſimply we deny not; their abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be neceſſary to ſalvation, and that it can make attrition to be as good as contrition, are tasks for them to prove who affirm them.</p>
            <p>And as for that he ſaies, that <hi>then they had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves or the known Diſciples of the Apoſtles to tell them the meaning of thoſe words.</hi> He does not well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he ſaies, if they gave the ſenſe of thoſe places which are obſcure, where are theſe interpretations? why have we not a tradition of them? if not, they ſay nothing? if ſo, they muſt derogate from the Church's fidelity, becauſe it hath juſtly communicated and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us traditions of other matters then are written, and not the ſenſe of thoſe Texts which are written. 2. We are yet entirely able to hold the buckler in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our poſition, that there is no ſuch need of an infallible expoſition of thoſe Texts which contain points neceſſary for faith or practice. The water where the lambe might wade was clear enough then; and had been yet clear enough, had not the great Fiſher troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the waters for better fiſhing. If the point of the diall be not fixed, they may vary the ſhadow, but the ſun keeps it regular motion. So if their <hi>gnomon</hi> be looſe, they may make the time to go for them. but the ſun of righteouſnes (Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday and to day and for ever as the author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks) doth in an uniforme and regular courſe ſhine in the
<pb n="1055" facs="tcp:40740:482"/> Scripture: and the doctrine of Chriſt by the twelve Apoſtles is equally ſet for all times; only the Roman makes the variation, who would have the Scripture follow the Church, and not the Church the Scripture. We need not then yet their <hi>Oedipus,</hi> who hath a foot ſo great that he muſt wear a ſlipper.</p>
            <p>The following words in this ſection are ſomewhat cloudy; and they do need a clue to ſhew us their right connexion. His drift ſeems in them to be this to make me deſtroy my ſelf by two poſitions, firſt <hi>that the Church is ſecure from damnative errour, though not from all ſimple errour,</hi> the ſecond this, <hi>Hereſie conſiſted in oppoſition to clear Scripture.</hi> Anſ. One would have thought that a bad concluſion could not lawfully be begotten of theſe two poſitions; ſince ſpecially the ſecond is ſuch as was antiently held by thoſe who do underſtand diſtinctly points of divinity. And alſo I had thought once that he had granted the former; though now, <hi>pro re na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a,</hi> he doth think otherwiſe. I am ſure he had more reaſon to ſtand to it, then to abide the perill of the negative. Well, but what from hence? <hi>Whence all thoſe muſt needs be Hereticks, who oppoſed clear Scripture. Therefore all thoſe who hold thoſe prime points in which you and we differ, with us againſt you, were hereticks: for they held theſe points which you ſay, are againſt clear Scripture</hi> Anſ. The Church is conſiderable in the quantity of it; ſo it is univerſal or particular: it is conſiderable in the quality, inviſible or viſible: the Church inviſible is diſtributively ſecure from all damnative errour: the univerſal viſible may be ſecure from all damnative errour. This we ſay ſtill. But by what engine is this drawen into his concluſion, which he ſaies ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed partly from this poſition? But 2. What if we grant all that thoſe who have been with them againſt us in the points of difference were Hereticks; it is but like for like, for they familiarly give us no other name
<pb n="1056" facs="tcp:40740:483"/> then Hereticks. And I think we ſhall do very few Learned and ſober men any harme, if we ſhould ſay, that all thoſe who have differed from us, are Hereticks. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but we know on which part the Fathers of the Church ſtood. We can carry our Fathers through the flames of diviſions ſafe, I mean the antient Fathers of the Church. But 3. If they will do us right, upon occaſion for it, we will diſtinguiſh, and ſo do them a favour; but only then they muſt be guilty here of a fallacy of conſequent: for although Hereſie be oppoſite to clear Scripture, yet all which is oppoſite to clear Scripture, by their leave, is not Hereſie. This is a condition of Hereſie: but this is not the eſſentiative of it. There may be and are plain points of Scripture which reſpect circumſtances, and yet theſe are not matters ſufficient to make differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in them to be Hereſie. They account indeed all difference to be Hereſie, becauſe they reſpect not points in order to the matter, but to the propoſal of the Church, which hath it ſelf equall to all: but the tenure of our principles is yet good. And yet this we will grant them, that he who denies any thing, which he confeſſeth to be plain, he is an Arch-Heretick; but not in reſpect to it preſently in the matter, which may be a circumſtance; but in reſpect to it as confeſſed plain, becauſe thus he ſhould deny Gods veracity. And yet 4. the difference is not ſo much in oppoſition to clear Texts as in their obtruding matters of faith for which they have no Text.</p>
            <p>He proceeds. <hi>But by your own confeſſion Chriſt had no viſible Church</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. Will he again ſnarl himſelf? Firſt it lyes on the challengers part to make good two points, one that theſe points of difference were held in the Primitive times; and the ſecond that they were held on their ſide. They ſay we have runne away from the antient Catholick Apoſtolick Roman faith; this is
<pb n="1057" facs="tcp:40740:483"/> work for them to prove. And until this be ſettled, we have nothing to ſay to that concluſion, <hi>that Chriſt was with the oppoſers of evident Scripture.</hi> And yet we can ſay alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that it is falſe in the propoſition; and falſe in the concluſion; as applied to us. And yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe may be ſaid of it by and by. Thus we anſwer them if they intend the words of the primitive times: if they intend them only of the <hi>laſt ages preceding</hi> the <hi>reformation,</hi> we ſay firſt, that we may be ſomewhat more bold becauſe their Church in thoſe times was more degenerated. But 2. We need not deny that Chriſt was with his ordinances even in thoſe times, as to lawfulneſs of baptiſm; and to the poſſibility of ſome's being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; who might privately abhorr the groſſer errours, or ſimply might ſwallow them as the Whale did <hi>Ionah</hi> undigeſted. <hi>Delictum ambulat cum Capite;</hi> they followed <hi>Abſalom</hi> in the ſimplicity of their heart. Therefore 3. as to the <hi>oppoſers of evident Scripture,</hi> that either Chriſt muſt be with ſuch, according to our ſuppoſitions, or elſe with none for <hi>theſe laſt ages;</hi> we can eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. To be with them, ſo, as to give them infallible aſſiſtance; or to be with them ſo, as not to withdraw all adminiſtrations of his ordinances, the former ſenſe we can preſently deny Chriſts being with them in; for we deny it to all times after the Apoſtles: in the latter ſenſe we can grant it; and yet they can get nothing by it. Yea we can alſo deny them this; and can anſwer to the other part of the disjunction, that if not with them then with none for thoſe times: this we can anſwer to, and ſay that his disjunctive is not yet immediate becauſe many or at leaſt ſome might be led to heaven by the Cloud, as well as in the time of <hi>Elijah:</hi> and as they will ſay, in the time of Anti-Chriſt.<note place="margin">N. 30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This makes number; being little elſe then a ſyllabus of former Texts. He thinks in them to prove two things, firſt that the ſpirit will be with the ſuceſſours of the
<pb n="1058" facs="tcp:40740:484"/> Apoſtles <hi>for ever.</hi> And 2. Secure them <hi>from errour,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>he will guide you into all truth.</hi> Anſ. As for the firſt we need not ſtand upon that; for the queſtion is not ſimply upon Chriſts continuance with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours; becauſe we deny it not in termes. But the queſtion is upon the univerſality of the object [all truth] namely whether it be to be taken reduplicatively to truth; or ſpecificatively to neceſſary truth. The latter we can grant to the Church as inviſible, and to the univerſal viſible. The former we ſtill deny. For firſt, it reſpects the Apoſtles principally, as appeares by the twelth ver. <q>I have many things to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them now.</q> This muſt be ſpoken unto the Apoſtles perſonally; and not as they were <hi>perſonae ſupponentes.</hi> But this he takes no notice of. And then again, the oppoſing of [for ever] by the ſpirit to a little while of being with them in body, muſt referr (as it is noted) to the Apoſtles, becauſe he was not any time with the ſucceſſours, in body. Yea alſo, this will be true in the time of Anti-Chriſt, will it not? if not, then the promiſe is not made good; and ſo Chriſt ſhould not be as good as his word. If ſo, then it is extendible in the promiſe to the Church inviſible, when the profeſſion is not ſo viſible. Then why do they arogate it to the Church viſible? Again, this equally reſpects all the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth it not? If it does not; then they ſhould ſatisfie themſelves with a limitation where none is expreſſed, which lately they would not doe: If it does, then all Biſhops are equall, becauſe they all ſucceeded the Apoſtles as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> affirmes in his epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius.</hi> 4. <hi>All truth</hi> muſt be reſtrained in regard of the kind; for it muſt be Theological. Yea alſo in regard of the ſpecialty; it muſt be neceſſary truth, for otherwiſe how was this promiſe made good for the firſt three hundred yeares, wherein there was no Generall Council by their
<pb n="1059" facs="tcp:40740:484"/> own confeſſion? Put it then into forme, all infallibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is in a Council. In that ſpace there was no Council; then in that ſpace there was not all infallibility; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at moſt only in points neceſſary. They cannot deny the major; becauſe they annex infallibility, ſince the Apoſtles, to a Council. The minor they confeſs. So then, <hi>the promiſe of Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>was made equally to the Apoſtles and ſucceſſours;</hi> yes, taking it rightly, equally to all the Apoſtles amongſt themſelves; and to all the ſucceſſours amongſt themſelves (not equally to the Apoſtles and to their ſucceſſours comparatively to both) is yet made good according to its own tenour, in its own ſenſe, with their conſequences. Therefore their Romiſh Divines do carry it more ſoberly; for ſo they ſay upon the place; <hi>and therefore the Church cannot fall into Apoſtaſie or Hereſie, or to nothing, as the adverſaries ſay,</hi> they do not ſay, it cannot fall into any errour: Into Apoſtaſie, or Hereſie, or nothing, it cannot fall: but into errour, it may fall. To be ſure, this is the ſureſt way unles they had beter arguments againſt every errour whatſoever; or better anſwers for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, we muſt attend his Syllogiſm, <hi>all this time all the viſible guides or Praelats of the Church were lead and did leade into opinions contrary to the texts of your Church, but all this time the ſpirit of truth did abide with them, guiding them into all truth, therefore the opinions contrary to your Church were true and not errours.</hi> Well not to trouble them as to ſtrictnes of forme. To the propoſition we can ſay, that if they intend it of all the times from the Apoſtles we utterly deny it; if they mean it of the times after the firſt ſix hundred yeares of the Church, then we grant the propoſition, but utterly deny the aſſumption, they were not guided by the ſpirit into ſuch a Latin Edition, into halfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And this denies his proof that thoſe opinions
<pb n="1060" facs="tcp:40740:485"/> were true, becauſe they were led into them by the Holy Spirit. This is denied; and is the queſtion. And it is more eaſily ſaid, that the Holy Spirit was with us by common aſſiſtance unto our opinions, then with them by infallible aſſiſtance unto their opinions. If we are to Judge of their aſſiſtance by the effects; we had need of infallible aſſiſtance, if it were convenient, for the diſcourſe, to conclude for them: but I am ſure we have no need of infallible aſſiſtance, to conclude againſt them.</p>
            <p>Neither is it any boot to them that the Spirit leads all into truth; for this may be limited to ſaving truth. And this is not ſufficient for them, who muſt have abſolute infallibility, or none. And then [all] may be limited, as that propoſition, [God will have all men to be ſaved] is limited by <hi>Aquinas</hi> out of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> by the like; ſuch a School-Maſter teacheth all in the Town; whereof the ſenſe is this; not that he teacheth every own ſimply but all that are taught are taught by him. So the Spirit all leads that are led; but all ſimply are not led. The limitation then in regard of the object of the Perſon, or in regard of the object of the thing cuts off all their proviſion from hence. And when we have ſufficiently refuted their points of difference, we have no need to ſay any thing, that the Holy Spirit ſhould <hi>teach contradictions,</hi> if he were with them and us too; for firſt, infallible aſſiſtance is aſſerted to neither, but denied: and common aſſiſtance doth not exclude all errour; and then 2. The Holy Spirit was not with them infallibly by the effect; for ſince the ſame Spirit doth not <hi>teach contradictions,</hi> he did not infallibly teach them that which is opoſite to Scripture which he did teach.</p>
            <p>That which followes in compare of the viſibility of their Teachers with ours or any other Churches, is but a meer flouriſh. <hi>Shew me a ſucceſſion in all ages of the
<pb n="1061" facs="tcp:40740:485"/> Guides and lawfull Paſtours of any Church holding your Tenets in points differing from ours.</hi> Anſ. Succeſſion <hi>de ſe,</hi> is like number, of no value. Therefore they muſt prove their doctrine to be right; otherwiſe it will be a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of errour: for as he ſaid, <hi>Conſuetudo ſine veritate eſt vetuſtas erroris.</hi> 2. It is accidentall to a true particular Church to have ſucceſſion: and the Church at firſt was true antecedently to the ſucceſſion; and ſo the former times muſt never have been certain of their being right, becauſe a Perſecution might afterwards have interrupted their ſucceſſion. 3. The Heretickes bragged of their ſuceſſion too: therefore this is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſpecial, diſtinctive argument: 4. Where is their ſucceſſion of univerſal Biſhops for the firſt ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares? Then where is their Church? Then either let them not give or take that argument. 5. Our opinions to them are negative: then they are to ſhew a poſitive ſucceſſion in the doctrin of thoſe points, which they can never do; unleſs by their infallibility <hi>poſt-nate antiquity</hi> ſhould be as good as Primitive. For as for the Fathers of the pureſt times, <hi>tam ſunt omnes noſtri quam</hi> D. <hi>Auguſtinus:</hi> I am ſure we may better ſay ſo, then <hi>Campian.</hi> 6. We can ſhew our doctrine by Scripture, let them ſhew theirs without it. And whatſoever is according to Scripture is true; this they deny not: our doctrine is yet made good to be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture: therefore the Charter of our points we have the Records of in Scripture: and this way is good enough for us, which is a <hi>poſteriori.</hi> And yet alſo we can tell them that if it had not been for their cruelty and domination, we might better have returned them that which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid to the Donatiſts, <hi>vos tam pauci, tam novi, tam turbulenti.</hi> And God hath left us in all ages, of greeks, and others who have given us occaſion to ſay, we hold nothing in the points of difference, but was held before. Therefore this argument doth not ſucceed: ſo that
<pb n="1026" facs="tcp:40740:486"/> they muſt ſtill <hi>labour to find a reaſon</hi> why our doctrine ſhould not be as good as theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 31.</note>The ſenſe of this Section we have had before. And it falls into ſuch a Syllogiſm, whatſoever was Gods end in giving of Paſtours is allwaies compaſſed. That the Church ſhould be without errour, and ſhould not <hi>be as Chidren wavering and carried about with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> was Gods end <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. Anſ. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was Gods end is allwaies compaſſed ſo farr as it was his end, where the effect depends not alſo upon morall cauſes; take it ſo and we grant the major, and deny the minor; it was not Gods end that the Church ſhould be without all errour whatſoever; and the effect doth depend upon moral cauſes; which may hinder the ſucceſs. The end of the Sacraments in the time of the Goſpel, they will ſay was to conferr grace <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> yet they ſay they have not that effect <hi>Ponentibus obicem.</hi> Or thus, whatſoever is Gods end in his will of purpoſe that ſhall ſurely be compaſſed: but what is his end in the will of ſign is not allwaies compaſſed; take it then in the latter ſenſe, ſo I deny the major, take it in the former ſenſe, ſo I deny his minor. For this would be more unreaſonable by their doctrine; for if God ſhould work omnipotently to ſecure men from errour by meanes, how ſhould the obedience of faith be brought under freedome of will? 2. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects alſo particular Churches: and therefore will not ſerve their turne, who, though they make but a particular Church, yet are wont to challenge the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the univerſal. 3. This Text ſpeakes nothing of the power of Iuriſdiction, but of the power of order, now the duty of our obedience beats reſpect formally to Authority and Iuriſdiction, or do they like ſome of <hi>Geneva,</hi> divide Paſtours and Teachers? And then do they think that the ordinary Paſtour is here princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally aimed at in their extraordinary ſenſe? 4. The
<pb n="1063" facs="tcp:40740:486"/> end of Paſtours then was the end of Paſtours now; to be preſerved by infallibility of Paſtours then was not the end of Paſtours then: therefore not now. The major is true by them, becauſe they apply thoſe words to theſe times of the Church, the minor is alſo true by them, becauſe there was not, by their own confeſſion, Councils held for the firſt three hundred yeares. <hi>The aſſiſtance therefore</hi> is not ſuch as preſerves from all errour. And laſtly, if we were to be preſerved from errour by the <hi>unanimous doctrine of thoſe Doctours and Paſtours,</hi> we ſhould never be ſecured from errour, unleſs in thoſe points wherein we agree.<note place="margin">N. 32.</note>

            <p>And as for thoſe wordes, <hi>my words which I have put into thy mouth, are free from errour in all points great and ſmall,</hi> yes, we grant it. This doth not contradict us, but they are to prove that whatſoever they ſay God puts into their mouth. Again it reſpects the Church as inviſible; and that conceit of his that it cannot be ſo taken, becauſe it ſpeaks of the words not departing out of the mouth, is not ſolid; for the uſe of the mouth may be there for confeſſion of the faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. with the mouth confeſſion is made to God.

<pb n="1064" facs="tcp:40740:487"/> teaching truth &amp; in another time not teaching or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not truth.

I ſaid not ſo. That which I ſaid, I have anſwered upon the place, I do not not deny abſolutly that God ſpeakes by his Church; but I deny that he ſpeaks now by his Church abſolutely, God may ſpeak by his Church that which is infallible: and yet not ſpeak by his Church now infallibly. That which is infallible in the principles of Scripture; not infallibly in the manner of deduction. If he did ſpeak allwaies, and allwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, there were no more to be ſaid; until that be proved, we ſay much is ſuppoſed.</p>

For theſe chapters do plainly regard the Church as inviſible, in order to ſalvation, which is properly applied to the Church, as ſuch: and this is more then truth: for it is poſſible for a man, not to have any errrour, and yet not to come to Salvation, and it is I hope, poſſible for a man to come to Salvation, and yet to have ſome errours.

               </q> and that <hi>all Nations and Kingdomes which ſhall not ſerve thee ſhall periſh,</hi> ſhould be meant of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is as likely as that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be Emperour of the world, as they pretend him Monarch of the Church. It was never true ſurely but then when the Emperours held the Popes ſtirrup, and the Duke was throwen under the Table. Or it was then true, when the Pope was the Sun, and Emperour the Moon.

That it is meant of the Kingdome of Chriſt in his Church, we deny not: but that it is meant of the viſible Roman, we flatly deny; and we uſe for proof, his own principle; that Kingdome which <hi>ſhall beat in pieces and conſume all thoſe Idolatrous Kingdomes and ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> is the Kingdome meant there. So then. But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is not that Kingdome which ſhall do ſo: therefore that is not it which is meant there. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is proved. Firſt they are not agreed amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether the Church be a Kingdome. And if they hold it ſo they hold it erroneouſly, or elſe the antient Church erred; for they looked for a Church in the Common-wealth, not for a Common-wealth in the Church, as he ſaid; and then ſure it did not ſtand for ever in the quality of a Kingdom. 2. If they take it in the letter, then it hath temporal dominion directly; which I think they will not ſay, ſince every one of them, as before, is not perſwaded to hold a temporal domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion indirectly, and <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia.</hi> If they do not take it in the letter, then it is meant of the myſtical Kingdome: and this properly reſpects the Church
<pb n="1067" facs="tcp:40740:488"/> inviſible. 3. Have they broken down all Idolatrous Kingdomes? have they broken down the Turke and Perſian? Yea, if they be a kingdome, there is one Idolatrous Kingdome more, which is not broken down, and that is theirs. Therefore are they bound by this argument to break down all their Idolls. But they hate Idols, as <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>

            <p>Again, it is meant of ſuch a <hi>Church as hath not falne into Hereſie;</hi> Yea? then we aſſume, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath falne into Hereſie by <hi>Liberius,</hi> by <hi>Vigiliu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again that Church which denies the Catholick Church, as ſuch, is heretical. Their Church denies the Catholick Church, as ſuch: for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Catholick Church to the Roman, by annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Roman to the Catholick. The propoſition is good, becauſe, to deny the Catholick Church as ſuch, is to deny an Article of the Apoſtles Creed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to check their uſurpation, the African Council cut off appeals to <hi>Rome:</hi> thus then it is not <hi>Daniels</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but a tyranny, which is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Again <hi>If the Church ſhould have univerſally fallen into uncertainty of true belief, it ſhould no longer have been the ſtanding kingdome of Chriſt, which ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> We aſſume, but their Church muſt fall into uncertainties of true belief, as we have ſhewed; therefore their Church

Again, their Church is not <hi>ſpread over the world</hi> in the quality of a Kingdome, therefore their Church is not that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

            <p>Yet <hi>if the Roman Church be not this Church, find me out a viſible Church.</hi> Anſ. Firſt ſuppoſe we could not, yet this were no argument for infallibility, it might make ſomewhat towards probability; if the ſuppoſition were firſt proved, that there muſt be ſuch a Church alwaies in a flouriſhing viſibility. Secondly, we take it yet for the Church as inviſible, and therefore his demand is unreaſonable. Thirdly their Church had not, in doctrine and diſcipline, that viſibility in the firſt ages of the Church, and therefore there was a Church, which had the priviledges of the Church viſible, and yet not theirs, but he tells us we ſhall have more of this in its place. So then this is but a preluſory weapon.</p>

               <note place="margin">N. 35.</note>Here again he comes upon me for clear texts to prove the controverſie about the <hi>infallibility of the Church,</hi> to be decided by Scripture. Anſ.

In reſpect to what he ſaies now, that I muſt bring <hi>clearer Texts</hi> of Scripture to prove the fallibility of the Church, then he to prove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, we add, that if he underſtands by <hi>[clearer Texts]</hi> as by reaſonable conſequence and deduction, it is done: if he underſtands them expreſſely <gap reason="foreign">

For if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſufficiently furniſhed with neceſſary direction, why ſhould it be thought defective in not determining in termes that controverſie, which is ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as for the Item he gives me, that the Texts I bring, muſt be for the <hi>Church not for the Synagogue;</hi> for he ſaies all his Texts <hi>ſpeak of that, not of the Synagogue,</hi> I am very well contented with this law.

This compliance with the Anabaptiſt requites their Freindſhip. Is not that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is plainely deduced out of Scripture? As the concluſion is potentially contained in the principles; ſo that which is in principles of Scripture is contained in Scripture. So our Saviours, "you erre not knowing the Scriptures &amp; then proves the reſurrection by that which is ſaid <q>[I am the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and the God of <hi>Iacob</hi>] ſo then Chriſt proved the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not by the Text, in the termes affirming it, but by the Text conſequently as deducing it.</q> 2. they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how little they have in Scripture <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="1070" facs="tcp:40740:490"/> Religion with reaſon and prudential motives, would they not? Then they cannot diſ-accept diſcourſes from Scripture: 4. I do not deny to be judged by reaſoning out of Scripture: no nor by antiquity neither, though it be not an argument <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but they have more need to bragg of them, becauſe they are not theirs. 5. I do not appeal to Scripture as a formal Judge, but as to the law by which all Judgment is to be made. And again, as the Philoſopher, thoſe the beſt lawes which leave leaſt to the Judge. All things then conſidered, he hath reaſon to quit <hi>the field</hi> unleſs he hath a minde to encamp againſt the truth. And if they have ſo much for them in Scripture, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſert words as here he cracks; ſurely thoſe Romaniſts who have ſpoken of Scripture ſo diminutively have not been ſo wiſe as they might have been. So then this Paragraph we may end with this account; the <hi>Socinian</hi> is ſuppoſed to plead reaſon againſt Scripture and the Church; The Papiſt pleads the Church without reaſon or the Scripture; The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant pleads Scripture with reaſon and the Church Catholick.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 36.</note>This concerns the reading of a place in St. <hi>Auſtin De utilitate credendi,</hi> which he quoted about the authority of the Church, thus, <hi>velut gradu certo innitentes;</hi> I found it in a Froben Edition otherwiſe, namely thus, <hi>velut gradu incerto nitentes:</hi> He ſaies it is in an antienter Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben, as he reads it. And beſides, he thinks the ſcope might lead me to his reading. Anſ. The ſcope directs us to think the authority of the Church to be but as moving, not as determining Faith, as I have ſhewed upon another place of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which he replies nothing to. Moved we are by that authority as an uncertain ſtep to God by whom we are aſſured, not to God as the object of worſhip, but to God as the author of our faith. And as for his objection, that it is ridiculous to be helped <hi>to certain truth</hi> by authority
<pb n="1071" facs="tcp:40740:490"/> uncertain, it is not of much weight. For although uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty formal is not helpful unto truth, yet that which is uncertain for us to rely upon may be helpfull. As the Catholick Moderator obſerves of the Huguenot in point of juſtification, that he is ſomewhat nice becauſe he will not lay hold upon ſuch a bough which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture might ſave him, yet is he not to be blamed, becauſe he doth rely upon the righteouſnes of Chriſt, which is a certain bough, and will ſurely ſave him: ſo it may be we are thought too ſcrupulous, becauſe we will not leane and reſt our faith upon the authority of the Church; yet are we not to be blamed, becauſe we reſt it upon God. Yet may we then rely upon a bough uncertain till we come to a ground more certain. The voice of the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> was not certain: yet the people were moved to come to Chriſt by what ſhe ſaid; but afterwards they found better ſatisfaction from himſelf; and then gave an account of their faith, not by her voice but becauſe they had <hi>ſeen him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for miracles which were ſpoken of to be part of St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> authority, he thinks they were no <hi>unaſſured ſtep;</hi> it is eaſily anſwered, that however this doth dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the application of that Text to the authority onely of the Church, ſince the authority he ſpeaks of is not onely of the Church. But Secondly, miracles when they are received, are an argument to confirm the truth: but miracles are not to us an aſſured ſtep, becauſe we are not certain of them to be true: Since we hear in Scripture of lying wonders, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. So that the doctrine rather proves the miracle than the miracle the doctrine. The doctrine is to be believed without a miracle, but the miracle is not to be believed when the doctrine is falſe, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>But then as to the reading of that place in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſomewhat more may be ſaid. It is true that in an editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ba ſil</hi> 529. it is <hi>Certo,</hi> but yet there is ſome
<pb n="1072" facs="tcp:40740:491"/> marke with it to note a <hi>Criticiſm in a various lection.</hi> In two other editions it is <hi>gradu incerto.</hi> But alſo we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt the Latin in the grammer of it, if it be read his way; for where will they finde the verbe <hi>[innitor]</hi> to govern an ablative? <hi>Nitor</hi> doth; but <hi>innitor</hi> doth not. And in reading <hi>Stapleton's</hi> relections I finde he uſeth <hi>[innitor]</hi> with a Dative. Therefore may it be probable that our reading is the right: and that the <hi>[in]</hi> changed its place; and in ſtead of <hi>gradu incerto nitent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> it was made <hi>gradu certo innitentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 37.</note>In this he reſumes the ſpeech upon the authority of the Devil when he ſaies any thing conformable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To this I ſaid more then was neceſſary. Another would have ſent it back to the place from whence it came. But that which I ſaid liberally he exagitates diſingenuouſly.</p>
            <p>I anſwered firſt that we are forbidden to conſult with the Devil; but are injoyned to conſult with the Church. To this he rejoyns, <hi>this hinders not his being conformable as long as he ſpeaketh conformably to Scripture.</hi> Repl. This was propoſed by him to preſſe us to the uſe of the Church, therefore that which was ſaid by me properly made a difference betwixt them, becauſe we are to take direction from one not from the other, even for thoſe things which we know he knowes moſt certainly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though there be no difference in the matter of truth as to both: yet there is as to the immediate Authour.</p>
            <p>And I granted to them ever that the Church to be conſulted with ever, is the Church as <hi>viſible.</hi> Yet doth it not from hence follow, I hope, that it ſhould be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo viſible, as that we can conſult with it. The viſible Church is ever to be conſulted with: but this viſible Church is not ever ſo viſible; viſible at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; not ſo viſible at all times. For there was not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the Church a Pope and Council; and if a Pope, not a Council, by their own confeſſion. And in
<pb n="1073" facs="tcp:40740:491"/> ſuch caſes, they have ſaid before that the Church muſt content it ſelf with former determinations. And though that which is infallible may be orderly conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with; yet not all that is to be conſulted with is not ſurely infallible. Every Prieſt is not infallible I think they will ſay; and yet is to be conſulted.</p>
            <p>My Second anſwer is of the ſame kind and that, which he ſaies would be of ſome weight, if we granted not ſuch uſe to be made of the Church, as thereby to think well of that which is propoſed, but the certainty of faith is, <hi>cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum</hi> this is not to be given to the Church ſimply.</p>
            <p>As for the Third anſwer, we ſay eaſily, there is no comparative in negatives: neither is the one nor the other infallible; though I am more moved by the one whom we have reaſon to reſpect, the Church, than the other, whom we have reaſon to ſuſpect.</p>
            <p>So then, that which is apprehended true is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either abſtractly from the ſpeaker, or complexely with the ſpeaker; in the former it is conſidered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the matter; and ſo he ſaid well, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we are not to look at ſo much the author as the matter, in the latter reſpect it is reſpective to the motive; and ſo I am more induced by the Church, though not determined. And therfore as to thoſe termes, <hi>to whoſe ſaying you would give an infallible aſſent, when you ſee that which he ſaith to be conformable to Scripture,</hi> we ſay that the term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> [ſaying] is diſtinguiſhable into the object purely, or into the object with the act and authour. In the former there is no difference: in the latter there is, we may believe that which is ſaid, when we do not believe him that ſaies it. And ſo may we believe rather the Church, whoſe <hi>office</hi> it is to propoſe truth, as he confeſſeth it is not the Divells.</p>
            <p>Neither did we by theſe anſwers <hi>ſmother up</hi> any thing which <hi>clearly overthroweth</hi> our <hi>replie,</hi> who ſay we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Church onely ſo far as we ſee her follow Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="1074" facs="tcp:40740:492"/> That which he ſaith here doth no way weaken our replie. It hath been anſwered before; and the ſtrength of it broken. For firſt though <hi>they could not ſee at all how far the Church followed the Scripture for the firſt two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years,</hi> and the <hi>barbarous Nations never having ſeen the Scripture did truely believe,</hi> doth this hinder us from hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding now that we are to believe the Church, in points of faith, no further then we ſee grounds for what they ſaid, out of Scripture? take it of faith divine and in things of faith, it is yet good. And their inſtances do not evacuate it. <hi>Diſtingue tempora,</hi> diſtinguiſh the times, God might in that time and ſeaſon of immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation work then a faith immediately; which now is not reaſonable to expect ordinarily, as appears by the firſt Chap. of the Ep. to the Hebrews the firſt ver. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegia pauc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Knotts</hi> himſelf is loath to aſſert it. And this is that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>non ex perſona fides, ſed ex fide perſona aeſtimanda eſt.</hi> We are not to eſteem the doctrine by the perſon, but the perſon by the doctrine. And the tradition which St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks of, was the ſum of the Chriſtian Faith, which is in Scripture: So he as before, and ſo St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> vnderſtands it, as may appear by that of <hi>Cyril</hi> in his fourth Catech. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This Chapter which concerns the Hypotheſis ſhould injuſtice have been longer, but he reduceth the proof of it to a ſmall pittance, and if all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>which ſubmit not themſelves to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>as their ſupreme Paſtour,</hi> be of no better proportion, it will be Catholick for all that do ſubmit, but not for all.</p>

            <p>But ſince he is ſo ſhort in this, we will be even with him; and bring all he ſaies in this ſecond Treatiſe (for ſo ſome times he calles it) into one Syllogiſm; the Church is the Judge infallible appointed in buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Religion.

               </gap> and therefore he quarrels with me, becauſe we except againſt his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it. It is true had the major been a maxim irrefragable, then there had been more reaſon to blame us for exception againſt it, and for not applying our ſelves in preſent addreſs to the minor; but ſince we ſee no cauſe, nor the Churches of God, why the propoſition
<pb n="1077" facs="tcp:40740:493"/> ſhould be ſwallowed, we call upon him to make good the theſis, that there is a Church appointed as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge in buſineſſes of Religion, and therefore we told him that he might as well prove he had right to <hi>Utopia,</hi> becauſe he only claimes it; whereas he ſhould firſt prove the <hi>An ſit?</hi> whether there be ſuch a place.

            <p>Well, but he muſt prove his minor,<note place="margin">N. 2.</note> becauſe all other Churches do not lay claime to this infallibility; and are demonſtrated to be fallible; we grant the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, without any proof, and his proof was not ſo good as his propoſition. But therefore, it belongs to them to be infallible; we deny the conſequence. We deny the Title upon the claime.

And the weaknes of it appeares in that it is weaker grounded upon a true ſuppoſition, nor is it very ſound in the proceeding of the conſequence, in the firſt regard, we ſay <hi>debile fundamentum fallit opus.</hi> And therefore ſince that is one of his principles, his concluſion muſt be naught, as before. His conſequence he proveth thus, <hi>the Proteſtant Chucrh and all other Churches different from the Roman do Iudge themſelves, acknowledge themſelves, declare and profeſs themſelves to be fallible and that according to infallible Scripture. If then any of theſe Churches be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (in what they Iudge and declare for truth grounded in Scripture) they are infallible in this their Iudging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring themſelves to be fallible; therefore infallibly they are fallible. Therefore upon ſuppoſition that it hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved, that ſome Church is Iudge of controverſies, and infallible, and it being by the former argument demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively
<pb n="1078" facs="tcp:40740:494"/> proved that neither the Proteſtant Church nor any Church different from the Roman can be Iudge of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and infallible; it evidently followeth that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is this Iudge and infallible, as ſhe teacheth her ſelf to be.</hi> This is the whole procedure of his diſcourſe. Herein he hath a ſuppoſition that there is ſome Church which is Iudge of controverſies and infallible, this is not yet, nor can ever be proved. And here is alſo another ſuppoſition that no Church different from the Roman, hath claimed this priviledge upon declaring her ſelf infallible: But this may be demurred upon; for in effect and by way of interpretation, this was done by the Donatiſts, who like the Roman ſeparated themſelves from their Brethren and taught no ſalvation but in <hi>parte Donati.</hi> And therefore his diſcourſe is more weak while we queſtion his ſuppoſitions: but yet ſuppoſing his ſuppoſitions to be good; firſt, this makes them not to be infallible by way of conſequent, if by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For that none other Church doth claim this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is extrinſical and accidental to the Roman right; and it doth little victory, relate to poſſeſſion rather then right. And if truth of right, ſhould right of truth be given <hi>primo occupanti? Veritas eſt virgo ſemper,</hi> as he ſaid; <hi>non dum occupatur.</hi> And therefore the neceſſity of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is left to ſhift for it ſelf, ſince all that can be ſaid for it, comes to paſs, in the matter, upon this accidental negative: for if any Church of the world had been as bold as the Roman in claiming this infallibility, they had had it before them: but becauſe there hath not been claim laied to it by other Churches, that which they have found and taken up, muſt belong to them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, what he ſaies that I make him argue thus, <hi>the Roman Church claimeth infallibility, therefore by claiming it ſhe hath right to it,</hi> is no great ſlander, though the termes might not be the ſame: for he doth little elſe in his former treatiſe, when he ſaies, <hi>All
<pb n="1079" facs="tcp:40740:494"/> other Churches of all other Religions do ſay indeed that they are themſelves, the only true Churches, but none of them ſay themſelves to be either the Iudges of controverſies or to be infallible; therefore they cannot be either Iudges or infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And what ſenſe is this argument reſolved into, but this; that the claiming makes the right, and therefore he might ſomewhat have ſpared a reproach which falls upon him. Neither is it true, <hi>that all other Churches of all other Religions do ſay indeed that they are the only true Churches.</hi> And this I noted before; for which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſaid to me now.</p>
            <p>But he ſaies, <hi>I ſay nothing to that</hi> which he <hi>preſſeth</hi> and <hi>ſtill doth preſs,</hi> that the <hi>Church which is appointed by God for infallible Iudge of controverſies, cannot poſſibly be any of thoſe Churches, which teach themſelves not to be this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Iudge.</hi> No? Have I ſaid nothing to it? Yes, I have ſaid as much, as he could prove, that none of thoſe Churches are ſuch a Church. And I have alſo ſaid that his ſuppoſition was to be denied; and to this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his my propoſition is contradictory; no Church is appointed by God to be infallible Judge. But, becauſe he hath been a valiant ſuppoſer, I muſt be accounted a weak diſputant. If he includes the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the argument for one of the propoſitions, I deny that propoſition. And if he will yet conclude, he makes it a formal Enthymem, but in vertue none. And therefore I ſaid to him in termes, <q>firſt then make it out that there is ſuch an infallibility to be had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you challenge it, and do not prove the being of it by the challenging of it, leſt the Roman Eagle be ſaid to catch at flies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet he goes on, <hi>It had been very eaſie to underſtand this right, and not to make me ſay that onely laying claim to infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is a ſufficient proof of infallibility. Anſ.</hi> I think that I have underſtood more then my adverſaries have been contented with. And I ſay yet it is <hi>eaſie to underſtand</hi>
               <pb n="1080" facs="tcp:40740:495"/> here an argument by a claim. And ſo they muſt do, if they will conclude their Church to be the infallible judge. It is the beſt plea they have upon the ſuppoſition; and the only plea without it. And I have the leſs to do, becauſe he denies this <hi>argument</hi> to be a ſufficient proof, if not that, &amp; the reſt may anſwer themſelves. And I ſay as he ſaies in this that though a <hi>Miniſter muſt be a man,</hi> yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that ſuch an one ſhould be a Miniſter <hi>becauſe be is a man and not a woman</hi> (unleſs Pope <hi>Ioane</hi>) becauſe one is more general, and therefore the propoſition is not ſimply converted; yet if he ſaies againſt us, <hi>the Church which is infallible judge muſt be a Church judging and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf to be infallible, and cannot be a Church which judgeth and teacheth her ſelf fallible,</hi> and if he makes this an argument, then he makes it an argument for himſelf, that their Church is the infallible judge, becauſe it teacheth her ſelf to be ſo. And yet he ſaies, <hi>this I ſaid not, but I ſaid that Church that muſt be infallible muſt not want this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore no Church teaching her ſelf (even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture) to be fallible, can truly be this infallible judge.</hi> Anſ. This evaſion will do them no good. A condition hath it ſelf by way of an inſeperable accident: but this inſeperable accident, when it is denied to any other, is as a property, and therefore beareth <hi>vim argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> the force of an argument; and I preſume they thus intended it. Let them therefore chooſe. But if it be <hi>one thing to ſay the Church which is the infallible judge, muſt be a Church judging and teaching her ſelf infallible, and another thing to ſay that that Church is infallible judge which teacheth her ſelf to be ſo,</hi> then that Church which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelf to be infallible may yet not be the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judge; and ſo there is deſtroyed (and by himſelf) alſo the neceſſity of conſequence. But ſecondly, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them in kind, the Church which teacheth her ſelf infallible is in this fallible, their Church teacheth her ſelf to be infallible, the aſſumption is theirs; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="1081" facs="tcp:40740:495"/> is proved thus, either it is true or the antient Church was not infallible, becauſe it did not teach her ſelf to be infallible; which he ſaies is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Therefore either their conſequence is not good, or they prove thereby the antient Church not to be the true Church, and ſo to be different from theirs. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, put caſe ſome other Church ſhould bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the Greek Church, and pretend to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Roman conſequence would hold but <hi>pro tempore;</hi> for then notwithſtanding the ſuppoſition; ſuppoſed, the queſtion which Church is the infallible judge, is yet to be decided by the Word or by the Sword. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>conſideratis conſiderandis,</hi> if he hath no other hold for his Hypotheſis he hath none. And ſo <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Lawmaker might well die in <hi>Crete</hi> for his fiction that the laws he gave the people came from <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the charge againſt their Church about the Millenary opinion, he would here anſwer it,<note place="margin">N. 3.</note> 
               <hi>that it was not admitted by the ſupreme paſtour of the Church defining with the Church aſſembled in a Council.</hi> Anſ. firſt If this were a reaſon, it would deſtroy all the traditions for three hundred years, becauſe they were not admitted by the ſupreme Paſtour defining with the Church in a general Council, for they ſay there was no council for the firſt 300 years. But ſecondly, was not tradition then an infallible rule? if it was, that is no anſwer: if not, the Scripture; or there was no infallible rule at all, and this contradicts them in both; for they ſay there was an infallible rule, and not Scripture.</p>
            <p>But he would alſo ſay, it was not generally admitted by the <hi>Church diffuſed or univerſal.</hi> Anſ. But I hope the diffuſed Church adds no authority to a matter of faith? This was indeed <hi>Alphonſus</hi> a <hi>Caſtro's</hi> opinion; but my
<pb n="1082" facs="tcp:40740:496"/> adverſary was not of capacity for that conceit, becauſe he annexeth authority to the Pope and a Council, and if the diffuſed Church (which includes the people) have any moment toward; credibility, why is it denied to them to have the Judgment of private diſcretion, ſince their conſent alſo makes a ſuffrage? And as for the <hi>diverſe Fathers</hi> not holding it as a Tradition, they may excuſe us certainly, unleſs they will prove it. He ſhould not ſurely prove it by <hi>Iuſtin;</hi> for he is accounted for it, himſelf, though many did not acknowledg it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is ſufficient for a Tradition. Is it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If not, let them ſhew more for other Traditions which they hold: if ſo, then that went for one. And then the <hi>many</hi> were not Fathers: St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> otherwiſe. Neither doth this conclude againſt <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> in all uſe; but may in point of faith, till we be as certain of Tradition. Till that time I am ſatisfied with the former place of <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and when we ſhall be as certain of Tradition derived from the Apoſtles times through all ages of the Church, in points of Faith, then we ſhall not urge this plea, that if this opinion of an Apoſtolical Tradition was ſo current in the Church upon the credit of one <hi>Papias</hi> at firſt, how ſhall we be ever ſure, in the account of Traditions, which is which?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">N. 4.</note>He hath learned to ſpeak here high, that he might at leaſt at laſt go off with noyſe. He calls it a <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which yet by his own words is to be held up by a ſuppoſition. Neither upon the ſuppoſition ſuppoſed will it be very neare a demonſtration; for it concludes not <hi>per ſe</hi> but by accident: and alſo it concludes rather or primarily negatively, that other Churches are not the infallible Judge. And if the diſcourſe were good, it would come to this, that other Churches ſhould fare the worſt for their modeſty, and the Roman ſhould fare the better for their impudency. And if the antient
<pb n="1083" facs="tcp:40740:496"/> Church was infallible, notwithſtanding it did not ſay that it was infallible (or elſe they differ from the antient Church in an eſſentiall praedicate) then their Church is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> infallible, notwithſtanding it ſaies that it is infallible. So then upon the whole matter, his <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> is not <hi>admitted;</hi> and therefore, could they well prove their Church to be fairer for this priviledge then any other, the ſuppoſition being admitted; yet ſince it is not admitted, it proves nothing in <hi>re,</hi> nor by their own confeſſion. And yet if it were admitted, his diſcourſe would not make him to be as good as his word in a <hi>demonſtration.</hi> And yet this ratiocination of his, inſtead of an <hi>un-anſwerable argument</hi> againſt us (but is proved not to be ſo) may be an unanſwerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, that they lie at catch, and have need of that which all other Churches have left; and alſo it proves that they have no better proof. What I ſaid more to what he ſaid more by anticipation, he ſaies nothing to.
